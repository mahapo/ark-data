[CLAPS]

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:10%
My name's Sonja Grace.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:10%
I'm a mystic and a healer, and
I'm presenting a workshop today

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:10%
that is about demigods,
aliens, and humans,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:10%
and what the cosmic connection
is between the three groups.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be taking you
into grounding and meditation.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to have an
exercise in that meditation

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to do
to help you sort of get

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
a little bit deeper with things
that will be revealed that you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:90%
need to know.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And then, I'm also going to
work with you with protection.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is, humans

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth, in my research,
about 20 million years ago.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.520 align:middle line:90%
And we are an alien species.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
When we came here, we came
from way out in the universe,

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and we were a very
young species.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, the development
of us, of our species,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:90%
has been through phases.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And in these phases, demigods
have come down to Earth

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and created different
civilizations.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
Atlantis in Lemuria fell,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
big comets hit the
Earth about 12,800 BC,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and the Earth just
totally changed.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Huge land masses broke off,
volcanoes, earthquakes,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:90%
flooding, it happened.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
we had an ice age.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And around 10,000 BC, the
ice started to recede.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Portals opened up, huge
portals all over the world.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:90%
It's like a signal.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Remember in Batman, how the
bat sign shows on the sky?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Earth
signaling to the heavens, OK,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
it's time for a new
phase of humanity.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And that's what happened.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:90%
All the demigods come down.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The Norse gods, the Mayan
gods, the Tibetan gods,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the Hopi gods, the Egyptian
gods, they all come through,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and they all influence that
group of people in that area

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:90%
and part of the world.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So what's important
here, is this

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:84%
has been going on
for 20 million years.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.710 align:middle line:84%
This is not just this phase
of humanity that we're in.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:90%
We're in it.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to the end of it,
which is why a lot of people

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
want to find their
spiritual truth.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:90%
They want to find why am I here?

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:90%
What is my purpose?

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that has
to do with the fact

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:84%
that, well, actually all
of you, came through--

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
maybe with the
exception of you--

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.220 align:middle line:84%
all of you came through
during Atlantis or Lemuria.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of you made
that agreement, OK, I'm

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.800 align:middle line:90%
going to do this human thing.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reincarnate over,
and over, and over again,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:90%
and help evolve the human race.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what
we've been here doing.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, is that we all
have a whopping case of amnesia

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:90%
when we reincarnate.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So we come in not
remembering where we've been.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
And that's a little
difficult, because we

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
get feelings about it.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We look at a picture in
a magazine, and it's--

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.980 align:middle line:84%
say a picture of Egypt, and
we go, oh, I have to go there.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
We're like obsessed with
everything about Egypt.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Because you have
past lives there.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are the
things that really dials us

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.630 align:middle line:84%
in to what is happening
karmically for us,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is at least we have
these recognitions.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
We know how we're connected
to things because we see it,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.860 align:middle line:84%
or someone connects or
share something with us.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.570 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times humans get
mistaken that we are here

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
because of each
other, that we're here

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
because our connection, our
soul mate is why we came here.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:10%
It has partly a little
bit to do with that.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But most of all, the
reason we're here, is her.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Is the Earth.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.670 align:middle line:84%
We all have a relationship
with this planet,

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:90%
and she is a magnificent being.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:84%
She is just incredibly
powerful, benevolent.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And just because
her body is round,

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make her
anything different.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:84%
She is a being, and she
is, in my words, a goddess.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that that's
our lesson or purpose

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
in being here, is
to connect, to have

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.370 align:middle line:90%
a relationship with the planet.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.350 align:middle line:84%
In this process of humans, and
what we're doing, and cross

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:90%
pollination, yes, the gods--

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Norse mythology,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.610 align:middle line:84%
but the gods would come
down and take human form,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and they would walk
among the people.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And they would sleep with
the women or the men,

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
and they would have
relations with them.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of
all demigods They

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
have a really strong
relationship with the people.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians I
consider demigods.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
They helped develop the
area, Salisbury Plain,

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:90%
where Stonehenge is.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
They helped build
and develop Tiwanaku.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians have a
huge, huge influence

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.710 align:middle line:84%
on Earth and on humans, and
they consider us their children.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
So as you think
about all of that,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and you actually may
have some demigod DNA

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
running through your system,
which I'm sure you do.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:11.900 align:middle line:84%
It is also to be noted that the
demigods are benevolent beings.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
When I see them, and I do see
all levels of the spirit plane,

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I see angels, and demigods,
and guides, I also

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.770 align:middle line:84%
see entities, and
demons, and aliens.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
I remove implants from
people all the time.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:84%
I see all levels of
the unseen world.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And when this
happens, and we are

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.350 align:middle line:84%
in the process of trying to
figure out, well, what is it?

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
demigods are huge.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:90%
They're like 16 feet high.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
They're huge.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
And they are quite benevolent.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And they are right
up there with angels,

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're right up there next
to God, creator, the goddess,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
however that word
gets used for you.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So they're very
benevolent beings.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And last year I created
Odin and the nine realms.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:90%
This is an Oracle deck.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
created it was--

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
it was so odd, we
went to Norway,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and I went to visit a stone
circle called Stoplesteinan.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was really excited to go
there, because before we went,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.580 align:middle line:84%
couple of years back, a
spirit traveled or time

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:90%
traveled to Stoplesteinan.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was then
that I experienced

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
this was in fact,
the very portal

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Norse gods used to
come through and then develop

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Scandinavia.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
So I told my husband,
we have to go there.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I have to see it.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So we went to Stoplesteinan.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:90%
And I went through to the--

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.170 align:middle line:84%
went into the stone circle,
and I activated the portal.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And there they came.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
All-- it was like, whoa--

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.990 align:middle line:84%
all the Norse gods started
coming through this portal.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that
they were so happy

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.400 align:middle line:84%
that this happened, because it
was time for them to come back.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.700 align:middle line:84%
That they were coming
back to help humanity.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I find
really interesting

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is not only did I
create this for them

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
to help them to come
back, but there there's

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:90%
all kinds of shows.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean there was the "Vikings".

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
We're watching this show
right now called "Ragnarok",

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that's all in Norwegian
with English dubbing.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
There's all this
stuff coming out,

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's because
they're coming back.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And people are picking up on
that, and they are saying,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.690 align:middle line:90%
OK, they're coming back.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiadians came to me a
couple of weeks ago and said,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
we're coming back.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It's time for a new
phase of humanity.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And their message was
really interesting.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.240 align:middle line:10%
They said, yes, we consider
all of you our children,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and we're proud of
you on many levels,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:10%
but there are things that humans
have created that could really,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:10%
really harm the Earth.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:10%
And our first and foremost
concern is the Earth.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:10%
And they said, as long as
humans help themselves and do

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:10%
the work, actively get involved
and do the work, we are there,

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:10%
and we're there to help.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
But if humans are
not doing the work,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and they're being really
complacent, and like-- uh--

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.630 align:middle line:84%
brain dead, it's like they
told me, a lot of people

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
are going to leave
the planet this year.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:90%
A lot.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to be
doom and gloom or fatalistic,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:84%
but I do feel this year, of
all years, is about the Earth.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.380 align:middle line:90%
She's going to change.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:84%
She's making the
same change you are.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:21.830 align:middle line:84%
She is getting consciousness,
even more than what she has.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Hard to imagine, but she is.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, she's going to move
and shake, and blow her top,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and do a whole lot of stuff.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And we just have
to be ready for it,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
because we're visitors here.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
We're not trees growing
out of her soil.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We're really extraterrestrials
in some nature.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Inside of us, our soul
body, is infinite.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.340 align:middle line:90%
We have an infinite soul body.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So that means you always have
been and you will always be.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:10%
And the attachment that you
feel, being in a physical form,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:10%
is just that.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:10%
It's an attachment.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:10%
But your natural state of
being is in spirit form.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.250 align:middle line:10%
So, yes, I don't
want to hurt my body,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:10%
or fall down, or whatever.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:23.330 align:middle line:10%
But in the long run, there
is just a transition.

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:84%
We call it death, but
it's just a transition.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So this human
experience that we're

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:34.970 align:middle line:84%
having, we have experiences
of running into aliens,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:84%
or having a sighting
of a UFO, or maybe we

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
think we saw
something, or there's

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
lots of people
out there who have

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:84%
really major like abduction
or contact type experiences.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And some people,
they've seen a ship.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people haven't
seen anything at all.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's all good.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, is that the
aliens and the alien life forms

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:12.260 align:middle line:84%
are to me, in my research,
very similar to humans.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.640 align:middle line:90%
They have an agenda.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:90%
They come here for water.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They come here for
natural resources.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
They come here to
harvest whatever from us,

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:84%
because they need
to create hybrids,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:84%
because they lost their planet,
and they have nowhere else

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But there are people
that are coming here,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:90%
people meaning aliens.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.490 align:middle line:90%
They have human form.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are in spirit form.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of them have no form,
and then they can take shape,

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
and they have form.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of aliens like to step
into human bodies, which

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is another thing I want to talk
about in terms of protection,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
because we, as people,
have free will.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:10%
What's the free
will card get you?

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:90%
It gets you out of jail.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The free will card is about
being able to say, no.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
This is my body.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
You have no right to it.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.100 align:middle line:90%
See you.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's with the men
scene type of aliens,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
like Greys, and
reptilians, and the ones

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that like to be kind
of nasty little spuds.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
There are some good
aliens out there,

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
but I have found, the
ones that I've run into

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
or had contact with that are
good, they don't mess with us.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like one
of those "Star Trek"

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
episodes where they kind of come
in and observe what's going on,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and then they leave.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:90%
Those are the good ones.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not coming here and
trying to take things from us

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.920 align:middle line:90%
or control us in some way.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.740 align:middle line:84%
But when the Pleiadians
were talking to me,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.920 align:middle line:84%
they told me that they
wanted to show me something,

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and they took me on what I
call a spirit travel, where

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I actually time travel, or
go out into the universe,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
and we toured just the galaxy.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I say that so casually,
but it was kind of like, whoa,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:90%
we're out here.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.230 align:middle line:90%
Like we were out there.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:10%
And they showed me
planet, after planet,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:10%
after planet of alien life form
that was being held as slaves.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:10%
They were enslaved.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:10%
They were being tortured.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:10%
They had horrible conditions.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at this and
when we came back, they said,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
we showed you all of this so
that you would go back and tell

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
humanity how lucky they are
and how good they have it.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, I was
not expecting that at all.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean they're highly
intelligent beings.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that they're
still enslaving and causing

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
aliens to be harmed in
some way, I mean, it was it

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.260 align:middle line:90%
was definitely an eye opener.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.060 align:middle line:84%
So aliens come in all
different sizes and shapes,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and they have a really
interesting agenda.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.220 align:middle line:10%
Some of them want to, as we
said, put implants in you.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:90%
What are implants?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Implants are like these
little tiny metal--

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I remove energetic implants, and
they're like highly, highly--

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
what's the word-- where the
technology is so advanced

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I can actually reach
in and take it out.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:90%
They're super, super advanced.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that I
remove are usually

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, or the ears, the
eyes, the nose, the throat,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:90%
the heart, fingers.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And people ask me all the
time, what are implants for?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:84%
They're keeping track,
not only of where you are,

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.470 align:middle line:84%
but they're keeping
track usually

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of multi-generations,
the mom, the daughter,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:90%
and the granddaughter.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times this
is all about the aliens

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:84%
wanting to learn more, gather
data, gather tissue samples,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.460 align:middle line:84%
put in implants so that
there is no pregnancy,

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:84%
or cause pregnancy so
they can take the baby.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I've seen all of
that happen, and I've

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.410 align:middle line:84%
seen many, many clients who have
gone through really hard stuff.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a client the other
day call me and say, I have

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
a scar on my leg, like a cut.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said, to
this day, I have

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
no idea where it came from,
who did surgery on me, or why.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So I took her into a session
and we did a whole process

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
around it, and it
all came back to her.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was really powerful.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It was so powerful to
have that knowledge

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and to understand what
happened to her and why.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the difference between
demigods, aliens, and humans.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Demigods are benevolent beings.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Aliens have different agendas.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:90%
There's still an agenda there.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Angels don't have agendas.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.570 align:middle line:90%
They just come to help.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:90%
No agenda, angels.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Demigods, they want
to help humanity.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Aliens, it varies.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.180 align:middle line:10%
Good ones, sort of good
ones, really bad ones,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:10%
there's a gamut.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
People, can I say
the same thing?

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Good ones, bad ones,
there is an agenda.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But you know what I'm
going to say about people?

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
No matter who people are, no
matter where they're from,

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:20.230 align:middle line:84%
no matter how rotten they are,
or how wonderful they are,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:90%
everybody has emotional wounds.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has karma.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Karma is unresolved
emotional wounds

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
from past lives
and this lifetime.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
So everybody has karma.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling
you from the moment

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
you're born until the moment
you die, you are doing nothing

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:90%
but working through your karma.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:10%
Everything is karmic.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have this huge
plate in front of us

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:90%
that is set out with--

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I have abandonment.

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I have betrayal.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:11.570 align:middle line:10%
I have resentment, anger.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:10%
I have all these
emotional things

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.370 align:middle line:10%
that I've brought with
me from past lives.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:10%
And that's the stuff that I
get to deal with in this life.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:10%
Does it mean, it runs my
life, or rules my life?

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.280 align:middle line:10%
What it means is that I'm
going to create situations

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:10%
where I feel
abandoned, or betrayed,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.060 align:middle line:10%
or I'm angry, or resentful,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:10%
And, you guys,
we're really clever.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, as humans, we're
like super, super clever,

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.570 align:middle line:10%
because we'll incarnate
as a man in one life

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.610 align:middle line:10%
somewhere on the other
side of the planet,

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.440 align:middle line:10%
and then, the next
life, we'll incarnate

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:10%
as a woman in a completely
different country

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.380 align:middle line:10%
with a completely
different family.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.590 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
same issues going

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.490 align:middle line:84%
on, different time
period, different body,

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
different gender,
different culture.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you get that
part figured out--

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
I do pass life readings.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I take people back where they
came from, what happened,

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.300 align:middle line:90%
and what needs to be cleared.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go in and
we clear it karmically.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
this is important,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is because this
is why we're here.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
We're like trying to
work out this karma.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you remember back
in Atlantis when it fell,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.930 align:middle line:84%
we all signed that
little paper that said,

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
yes, I will do the
next phase of humanity,

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and I will help
evolve the human race.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:46.860 align:middle line:10%
So we are in a time where
we're starting to merge

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:10%
all these things together.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:10%
There is more alien sightings.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:10%
There is more UFO sightings.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:10%
There's stuff that's
being revealed.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.120 align:middle line:10%
People are getting more
and more information.

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And the demigods
are coming back.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, they really never
left, but people are

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:90%
starting to become aware more.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:90%
And humans are evolving.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:10%
But we're at a critical point
because in this fifth dimension

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.720 align:middle line:10%
that we're in, this
higher frequency,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:24.710 align:middle line:10%
we are not going to move
forward unless we energetically

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:10%
change our vibration.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.990 align:middle line:10%
That's what that's all about.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:10%
Remember I said 20
million years ago?

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:10%
That's when humans
came to Earth?

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.100 align:middle line:10%
We were still in the
fourth dimension.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.740 align:middle line:10%
We didn't leave the
fourth dimension

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:10%
until the end of
the Mayan calendar.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:10%
Which was what?

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.780 align:middle line:10%
Six years ago?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:10%
How many years?

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:10%
2012.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:47.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Eight.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Eight.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm behind.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.970 align:middle line:90%
So this is the end.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why the
Mayan calendar ended.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It's because we were
leaving a dimension

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:05.300 align:middle line:84%
that we had been in since
we know our time on Earth,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:90%
the whole time.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is completely new to us.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all trying
to figure out, OK, am I--

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.590 align:middle line:90%
how do I do this?

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.020 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
experienced time and space

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:84%
being a little
bit weird for you?

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.530 align:middle line:90%
How many of you experienced--

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
especially eight years
ago, even five years ago,

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:90%
weird body pain?

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Like unexplainable body pain?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Neck pain, a lot of spine
stuff, tailbone, this

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.410 align:middle line:90%
is all this frequency change.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
This has a lot to do with
all the frequencies that

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:90%
are shifting and increasing.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And every day, it gets
more and more intense.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Every day it
increases, because--

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, if this is the
fifth dimension,

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and we just entered here,
look at how far we have to go.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.980 align:middle line:90%
We're like barely in it.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So by the time we
get to here, it's

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
going to be a pretty
high vibration.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.940 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.640 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:90%
We can get Nike's and do it.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
But, we have to remember
that it is the work that you

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.330 align:middle line:84%
do on the inner that helps
you to raise your frequency.

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we can take yoga,
and we can exercise.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:90%
We can watch our favorite movie.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.930 align:middle line:90%
We can laugh a lot.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:90%
We can tell each other jokes.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It raises our energy.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.680 align:middle line:84%
But the real work to doing
that is on the inner.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk to you and
take you through my grounding

meditation, and I
want to I'm going

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
to do a clearing on everybody.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And I want you guys to--

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to explain that
the grounding first, OK?

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So does everybody
know your chakras?

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:18.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.620 align:middle line:90%
First chakra, is where we sit.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:90%
Second chakra.

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Third chakra.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:90%
Fourth, heart.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.020 align:middle line:90%
Fifth, throat.

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Sixth, third eye.

Seventh, top of the head.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start
at the first chakra.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And you all know
what it's like--

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
well, men, of course
not, but a skirt,

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
when you pull a skirt
on, we're going to it's

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.220 align:middle line:84%
imagine this cone of energy
like it's a skirt really low

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:90%
on your hips.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it flares out,
the cone goes down

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the Earth.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like a skirt
almost right around your hips.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Then, there's a second
cone right the belly

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.700 align:middle line:90%
at the second chakra.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
It will go over that one,
and going up the third here.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the
fourth, they go inside.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm just letting you know.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
you through it.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.800 align:middle line:90%
The cones can be any color.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.470 align:middle line:90%
They can be clear.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly, we
want that cone of energy

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.930 align:middle line:90%
to go deep into the earth.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Because your energy is meant
to be connected to her energy.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We have this habit of letting
our energy leap out of our body

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.690 align:middle line:90%
and connect with like energy.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So if Kelly's angry, and I
kind of dial into it, and I go,

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'm angry too.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Then, our anger, it's like
this fusion thing going on.

[IMITATES ENERGY RUMBLING]

00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
You know what
we're really doing?

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:90%
We're creating more karma.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the karmic
hookup right there,

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:84%
because karma is unresolved
emotional wounds.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'm dialing into her anger.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:02.400 align:middle line:90%
She's dialing into my anger.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And our energy is totally
going back and forth,

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.390 align:middle line:90%
and there goes the karma wheel.

It just starts spinning.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn
to ground that stuff.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have to
feel our feelings.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have to process
and release those feelings.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to ground
that energy, those feelings,

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:90%
into the earth.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Because she can take it.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:90%
She's expecting that from you.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But she also really wants
you to receive her energy

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:90%
into your body.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And remember, we have an
electromagnetic field.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, she wants
you to receive her energy.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
close our eyes.

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:10%
We're going to go
into meditation,

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.840 align:middle line:10%
and I will clear everyone
while we're in meditation.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, we're going to do a
little bit of a process, OK?

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:90%
So get comfortable.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Take a couple of deep breaths.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.400 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel where
you're sitting on the chair.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And from that place in your
first chakra, low on your hips,

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.770 align:middle line:84%
create a cone of energy
that goes all the way down,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
deeper and deeper,
further and further,

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the Earth,

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.245 align:middle line:84%
and ground it with
a very large base.

00:28:35.245 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:90%
Go into your second chakra.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Create a second cone of energy
that goes over the first cone,

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.300 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the Earth,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.835 align:middle line:84%
and ground it with
a very large base.

00:29:00.835 --> 00:29:04.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Go into your third
chakra, your solar plexus.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Let it be like a
clear, calm lake,

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and create a third
cone of energy that

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
goes over the first two cones
all the way down, deeper

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:84%
and deeper, further and
further, all the way down

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:30.120 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
Earth, and ground it

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.650 align:middle line:90%
with a very large base.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:37.380 align:middle line:10%
And feel how that feels
with those first three

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:10%
chakras really grounded.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:46.690 align:middle line:10%
Feel the stability in your
body and your energy field.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:90%
Go into your heart.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Let your heart be like
a three dimensional sun

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:84%
with rays of love shining
out towards others,

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and rays of love shining
in towards yourself.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Create a fourth
cone of energy that

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
goes inside the
first three cones

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:12.210 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the Earth,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.925 align:middle line:84%
and ground it with
a very large base.

00:30:17.925 --> 00:30:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Go into your fifth
chakra, your throat.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Let it be soft and supple, and
create a fifth cone of energy

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that goes inside the heart cone
all the way down to the center

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and ground
it with a very large base.

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Go into your sixth
chakra, your third eye.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that you're looking
at a blank movie screen.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:55.090 align:middle line:90%
Let your mind be quiet.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And create a sixth
cone of energy

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that goes inside the fifth cone
all the way down to the center

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, and ground
it with a very large base.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.485 align:middle line:10%
Go into your seventh chakra.

00:31:11.485 --> 00:31:14.170 align:middle line:10%


00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:10%
From the top of your head,
create a seventh cone of energy

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:21.910 align:middle line:10%
that goes inside the sixth
cone all the way down, deeper

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:10%
and deeper, further and
further, all the way down

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.720 align:middle line:10%
to the center of the
Earth, and ground it

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:10%
with a very large base.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:10%
We're now connecting with our
higher selves, and with God,

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.670 align:middle line:10%
and the goddess.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking
for the violet flame

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to transmute any negative
energy, any negative thought

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:53.570 align:middle line:84%
forms from your bodies, your
auric fields, and this room up

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.530 align:middle line:90%
into light and love.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And just feel the
energy come in.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.480 align:middle line:10%
We're asking for the
white light to descend,

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:10%
and, again, saturate every
cell and every molecule

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:10%
in your body, your auric
field, and in this room.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The golden light of
divine love, just

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.240 align:middle line:90%
feel that energy coming in.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:10%
And the blue light
of protection,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:10%
feel that coming in.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Before we do a
protection exercise,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to clear everyone,
so stay in your meditation.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.950 align:middle line:84%
You can drop deep
into your belly,

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:45.750 align:middle line:84%
into the Hara, which is an
egg shape right next to-- kind

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of above the second chakra along
the vertical power current.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Just an egg shape in there.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Let your consciousness,
let all parts of you

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:90%
drop into that space.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.200 align:middle line:90%
It's very quiet.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.000 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very expansive.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It is your doorway
to the infinite.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.825 align:middle line:10%
[DEEP BREATHING]

00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:45.530 align:middle line:10%
Dropping down into your
first chakra, I want you--

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.430 align:middle line:10%
I want you to go into
your first chakra,

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:52.330 align:middle line:10%
and I want you to listen
for what the message is.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Usually, this is not like a,
oh, I'm so cool kind of message.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:90%
This is a core wound.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.530 align:middle line:84%
This is a-- each chakra
holds a core statement,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to find
what that core statement is

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.770 align:middle line:90%
for you in your first chakra.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
It might be something
like, I'm always alone,

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:15.090 align:middle line:90%
or I'm not worthy.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It can be a lot of things.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:22.719 align:middle line:84%
Let it come to you what that is,
and feel that message in there.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:25.453 align:middle line:10%
Note what it is.

00:34:25.453 --> 00:34:28.399 align:middle line:10%
[DEEP BREATHING]

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.210 align:middle line:10%
If you have found
that message, just

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:10%
raise your hands so I can
see where you guys are.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:53.139 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:35:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to experience
that message, whatever it is,

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.020 align:middle line:90%
as an object.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
See what it is as an object
in that first chakra.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a rock.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's a piece of wood.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It's something
there symbolically

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.835 align:middle line:90%
representing that message.

00:35:21.835 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
imagine yourself

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.420 align:middle line:84%
sitting in front of you, like
you're looking in a mirror.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to reach into
your body in that first chakra

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and wrap your hands around that
object, that core statement.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
fill it up with love.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And while you're sitting
there in front of you,

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look yourself in
the eyes and say, I love you.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:90%
Please, forgive me.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.940 align:middle line:10%
And now, I want you to find a
statement that really resonates

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:17.570 align:middle line:10%
with you, that you are going
to put into that first chakra.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's, I am worthy of love.

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's, I deserve
to manifest what I need.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that statement is
that really feels good to you,

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put that
statement in there.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Replace what you just dissolved.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.472 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:47.472 --> 00:36:49.055 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
ready, open your eyes.

00:36:49.055 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:90%


00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
When I teach
meditation retreats,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.860 align:middle line:84%
we have four days where
we sit in meditation,

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and we do a lot of processing.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.330 align:middle line:10%
And this exercise
I'm doing with you,

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:07.150 align:middle line:10%
is much longer
and more involved,

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:13.150 align:middle line:10%
but I wanted you to have
the experience of finding

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.010 align:middle line:10%
what is that core
statement you're

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:18.460 align:middle line:10%
holding in that first chakra.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:84%
The first chakra
is all about food,

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and clothing, and
survival issues, right?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:90%
I got a car.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a car.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:90%
I got a house.

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.185 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a house.

00:37:28.185 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- it's all
about our survival.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a statement in
there that is, I am not worthy,

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't deserve
that, then guess what

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.360 align:middle line:84%
is going out into the universe
from your first chakra.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not worthy of that.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we
change that message.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But it is super important
that you get in there

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and you dissolve that message,
that first message you got.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
that you forgive yourself.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Please, forgive me.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's like every day,
in the mirror, close your eyes,

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.300 align:middle line:90%
see yourself.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.440 align:middle line:90%
That's every day.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.770 align:middle line:10%
And that forgiveness
exercise, in my opinion,

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.700 align:middle line:10%
should be done with everybody.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And start with all
your enemies first.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Start with the people
you don't like.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.810 align:middle line:84%
Start with the people that you
have a really hard time with.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:37.120 align:middle line:90%
That's fun.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to look that
person in the eyes and say,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:90%
I forgive you.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Please, forgive me.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And feel it in your soul body.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it as a mental thing.

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.360 align:middle line:10%
We say, oh, I forgive
you all the time.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I forgave him.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's really from
here, and that's not

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:90%
where that should come from.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.990 align:middle line:90%
It needs to come from here.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:07.380 align:middle line:90%
Forgiveness is super powerful.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:10.830 align:middle line:84%
In 39 years of doing
work with people day in

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.920 align:middle line:84%
and day out, millions of
people over the phone,

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
one thing I experience

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:84%
the most from the
spirit world is

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.820 align:middle line:84%
people coming through
and saying, please, can

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.470 align:middle line:90%
you tell Jimmy I'm sorry.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Please, can you ask
mom to forgive me.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Tell her I forgive her.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.260 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
thing over there.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what they want.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.120 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
that they're forgiven.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.270 align:middle line:90%
It's like it frees them.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But we're supposed to
actually do all that here.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
do that work here.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we're
totally distracted.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.580 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, I'm on my phone.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the aliens just came.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I have to go to the store,
got to pick up the kids.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
We're like super,
super crazy busy,

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think about
forgiving each other really

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:18.170 align:middle line:90%
enough, in my opinion.

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Because we're so in the phone.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:26.060 align:middle line:84%
We're so-- seriously, we have
this relationship and yet--

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:84%
all of your screen savers
should say, I forgive you.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That will be a great reminder.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not trying to say that
you guys don't practice that.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I would like to see
that more in the world.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would like
to see all of us

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:84%
sort of helping people
get there, because we

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.480 align:middle line:90%
need it really bad right now.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:10%
As far as protecting
yourselves, because we

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.610 align:middle line:10%
talked about some gnarly
things with aliens,

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:10%
and I have a great
story for you.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:10%
I had a client back in Ohio.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:06.470 align:middle line:84%
He's like this 250 pound guy,
and he puts in pools and spas,

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.080 align:middle line:90%
and he's a big guy.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And he had an
implant in his arm.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:10%
And I said, OK--

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:10%
I was I was living in
Oregon at the time.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:10%
I said, OK, well,
let me take it out.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:22.138 align:middle line:10%
So doing my work that
I do long distance,

00:41:22.138 --> 00:41:23.680 align:middle line:10%
because I'm an energy
surgeon, right?

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.410 align:middle line:10%
I go in and repair tissue,
and work on hearts,

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.340 align:middle line:10%
and do triple
bypasses, and I go in

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.170 align:middle line:10%
and do all this work on people.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.487 align:middle line:10%
I take out implants.

00:41:33.487 --> 00:41:34.570 align:middle line:90%
So I reached into his arm.

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I start to take the implant
out, he started screaming.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, why are you screaming?

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Because it really hurts.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So I took it out,
and he was fine.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.660 align:middle line:10%
He stopped screaming.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.960 align:middle line:10%
That night I went to the store,
and I had to go get groceries.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And I came home.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.380 align:middle line:90%
It was pseudo dark.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It was like right at dusk.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
out of the car,

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:84%
opening up the back of the
car to get the groceries,

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and I could hear them.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And the aliens,
telepathically, said to me,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.300 align:middle line:84%
you have no right to
take that out of him.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around
and I looked up,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and I could see the
outline of a ship,

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and I could see a light
on the ship that was

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.320 align:middle line:90%
like frantically moving around.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:34.013 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
oh, there they are.

00:42:34.013 --> 00:42:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So I looked right up
at them and I said,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.960 align:middle line:84%
you had no right
to put that in him.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.190 align:middle line:10%
You had no right at all.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So you need to take your
business somewhere else.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.870 align:middle line:10%
And I said, some other colorful
phrases I won't repeat.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And literally, the
ship went straight up.

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And this happens to me all the
time, because I work on people

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.955 align:middle line:84%
and remove implants,
take stuff out.

00:42:58.955 --> 00:43:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I have a couple of brothers that
constantly are getting implants

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:05.290 align:middle line:84%
from Greys because they
were abducted, both of them,

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:90%
as children.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And I will wake up in
the middle of the night,

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and they're standing
there, because they're not

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:90%
happy with me.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.450 align:middle line:10%
So I protect myself,
and this is what

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.600 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to share with you if
you happen to be in a situation

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.180 align:middle line:10%
where you need to be protected.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't have
to live in fear.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:84%
We just simply
have to understand

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that we need to be
protected from this stuff.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So ask for the blue
light of protection.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Surround your body.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Ask Creator, send the blue
light of protection down.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Especially, if you
do the meditation,

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.990 align:middle line:90%
great time to do it.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, ask for the silver
light to go around that.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And, then, ask for the gold
light to go around that.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:55.140 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you're walking
around in this cool bubble

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of blue, silver, and gold.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:05.010 align:middle line:10%
You're surrounding your house
in blue, silver, and gold.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And this has been one
of the best protections

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.980 align:middle line:90%
that I've found that we can use.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.960 align:middle line:84%
When I do this with
my home, and God

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:84%
knows I have a lot of them
watching me and trying

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:84%
to harass me, I do this
protection around my home.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And, so far, knock
on plastic, it works.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.920 align:middle line:10%
All right, so that's
your protection

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:10%
with all this alien talk.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:32.770 align:middle line:10%
There are good aliens.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:37.720 align:middle line:10%
I have met one set of aliens
that were quite lovely.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.580 align:middle line:10%
They were very
small, like children.

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.560 align:middle line:10%
They're about this high.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was teaching a
meditation retreat in Oregon.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:90%
I think I was on day three.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And when I do these retreats, I
take everybody into ceremonies,

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.910 align:middle line:90%
so it's super intense.

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:56.130 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's energy, kind of
consciousness, gets altered.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:02.450 align:middle line:10%
Naturally, no drugs, no
alcohol, we just get altered.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:03.880 align:middle line:10%
And I was tired.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.940 align:middle line:10%
I told my husband I need
to lie down and just kind

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.430 align:middle line:10%
of rest for a little bit.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:10%
We had this travel trailer.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.070 align:middle line:10%
So I'm laying down.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.925 align:middle line:10%
I am not asleep, but
I'm kind of relaxed.

00:45:14.925 --> 00:45:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, I
felt my body just go--

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.460 align:middle line:10%
[IMITATES WHOOSHING]

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And I felt myself
literally going

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.430 align:middle line:10%
through the wall of the trailer.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:25.930 align:middle line:90%
It was weird.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I came down onto
my feet, I was on a metal--

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:32.560 align:middle line:90%
like a metal ramp.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:90%
No ability to stop this.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, literally I'm going.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.660 align:middle line:90%
And they walked me up.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.290 align:middle line:10%
I heard the ramp lift.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Sat me in a seat, strapped
me in, little guys.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I am
teaching a retreat.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I need to be somewhere.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.380 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.720 align:middle line:90%
I was totally freaked out.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And they said this will
only take a moment.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh, my God.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And the ship went up.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:11.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking out the window
going, I'm off the Earth.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And we went around the
back side of the moon.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I looked out the
window and there it was.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It was all lit up, a
giant space station,

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.550 align:middle line:84%
and I had that aha
moment of, oh my God,

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.790 align:middle line:84%
there is a space station on
the backside of the moon.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there is.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at them and
I said, who are you guys?

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:35.630 align:middle line:84%
They said, we wanted
you to see that.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, thank you.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:39.510 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who are you?

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
can call us Newton.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I said, like the
cookie, like Newton.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.130 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean?

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said-- they said the
last time we came to Earth we

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:57.160 align:middle line:84%
imparted knowledge
to Sir Isaac Newton,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and we've come back
now to give knowledge

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:04.250 align:middle line:90%
to another scientist on Earth.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.925 align:middle line:84%
And I said, hallelujah,
because we need it.

00:47:06.925 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm really glad.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:11.270 align:middle line:84%
They had no interest in
interfering with humans.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:15.620 align:middle line:84%
They had no interest in
bothering us in any way.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.480 align:middle line:90%
They were quite lovely.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.400 align:middle line:90%
And within a matter of--

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.310 align:middle line:84%
[WHISTLES] --that
fast, we were back.

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Boom, I was back lying
down, and they were gone.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:32.250 align:middle line:84%
That is my pleasant
experience to share with you.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.970 align:middle line:10%
I think that the more that
we ground in that grounding

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.550 align:middle line:10%
meditation that we just
did, the more that you

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:42.570 align:middle line:10%
ground your energy and really
connect it with the Earth

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:48.000 align:middle line:10%
energy, the better you're
going to be in this transition

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.730 align:middle line:10%
that we're going through, and
with all the energy that's

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:51.930 align:middle line:10%
coming in.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:84%
So just for fun, I want
to do one thing with you

00:47:55.350 --> 00:48:02.370 align:middle line:84%
that is kind of an Earth,
hello, Earth to person.

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:03.495 align:middle line:90%
So if you close your eyes--

00:48:03.495 --> 00:48:04.450 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHS]

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:08.580 align:middle line:90%


00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And feel that
first chakra again,

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:15.180 align:middle line:84%
and feel that cone of energy
going down into the Earth

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.340 align:middle line:90%
from your first chakra.

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Don't send the chakra anywhere.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Don't you know-- keep your
chakras where they are.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Send the cone of energy down
to the center of the Earth.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, I want you
to ask for Earth energy

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.180 align:middle line:90%
to rise up the cone.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And then, feel that Earth
energy spinning around

00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:39.690 align:middle line:84%
inside the chakra,
picking up anything

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:42.180 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't need to be there.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.145 align:middle line:84%
And then, release it
back down to the earth.

00:48:45.145 --> 00:48:50.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you have pain in a
particular part of your body,

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.960 align:middle line:90%
let's go into the second chakra.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.890 align:middle line:90%
We'll do it there.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:02.180 align:middle line:10%
You have stomach problems, feel
that second cone going down

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:10%
over the first cone.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's really grounded
into the center of the Earth.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, feel Earth
energy coming up the cone,

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and feel it swirling around in
that second chakra picking up

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.690 align:middle line:84%
anything that doesn't need
to be there, and release it

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:24.150 align:middle line:90%
back down into the Earth.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.600 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.190 align:middle line:84%
This is something that you can
do through all of your chakras.

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:36.450 align:middle line:84%
You can clean everything
out and release it back down

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:38.040 align:middle line:90%
into the ground.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, coming back up to your eyes.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:10%
So going back to
this relationship

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:57.830 align:middle line:10%
that we have with demigods,
with aliens, and with ourselves.

00:49:57.830 --> 00:50:03.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that we're ascending,

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.890 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into something
that is quite spectacular.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:90%


00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I think we are moving into
something spectacular.

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'm the kind
of person that if I

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:23.566 align:middle line:84%
know I'm moving into something,
I'm going to have a flashlight.

00:50:23.566 --> 00:50:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a tent.

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be ready.

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's that inside work.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:35.750 align:middle line:84%
That's knowing who
you are on the inside.

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Your soul body, which
is inhabiting your body,

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.670 align:middle line:90%
that's you.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.260 align:middle line:90%
Your soul body is you.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And your soul body
is the only one

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:52.480 align:middle line:84%
who should inhabit
your physical form.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.490 align:middle line:90%
That's your body.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's that free will
card I talked about, one

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.480 align:middle line:90%
of the "Monopoly" game cards.

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:03.940 align:middle line:90%
You have free will.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:06.420 align:middle line:90%
You can say no.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
People call me all the time,
I've got something in my house.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I know it's alien.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to get me,
whatever, whatever.

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Boy, stand up.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Turn the lights on.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Stomp your foot and say, no.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.650 align:middle line:90%
You have no right.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:22.790 align:middle line:90%
This is my body.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Because it's true.

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:90%
That is the gift to being human.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.540 align:middle line:90%
We have free will.

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:32.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:90%
So be firm.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:39.660 align:middle line:90%
We tend to be--

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:84%
we have such a pattern
through history

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:45.300 align:middle line:84%
of being either the
victim or the perpetrator.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.280 align:middle line:10%
We call them bullies now.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:10%
We have this pattern of that,
so it's really easy for us

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.800 align:middle line:10%
to kind of slide
into, oh, I'm scared.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what to do.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:59.970 align:middle line:10%
It's like, oh, my God,
go take a karate class

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:03.340 align:middle line:10%
and get in your body.

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Get mad.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:07.630 align:middle line:90%
Say no, because it'll help.

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.145 align:middle line:90%
It'll help.

00:52:09.145 --> 00:52:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I knew a woman
once who was being

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.800 align:middle line:90%
followed by a guy in Seattle.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.627 align:middle line:84%
It was nighttime, and she knew
she was going to get mugged.

00:52:15.627 --> 00:52:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like
totally that vibe.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:90%
He was behind her.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.737 align:middle line:84%
And he's following
her, and she's

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:22.070 align:middle line:90%
trying to figure out what to do.

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.740 align:middle line:84%
She keeps moving and changing,
going down the street,

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and he's like staying
right with her.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she jumped
and turned around

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and took this stance.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.540 align:middle line:90%
She goes, you better look out.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:90%
I know aerobics.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I know aerobics.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And the guy just
busted out laughing,

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and just shook his
head and walked away.

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
thing with aliens.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.370 align:middle line:84%
You better look out, I
know aerobics, right?

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:52.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are times,
you guys, when

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.760 align:middle line:84%
we have these experiences
where we see ships,

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:84%
or we have some kind
of dream, something

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:04.130 align:middle line:84%
comes into your dream, all
that stuff is really important.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But you having clear
boundaries, whether you're

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:11.180 align:middle line:84%
dealing with people, or you're
dealing with the unseen world,

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us don't grow
up with clear boundaries.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us come from
dysfunctional families.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we all have
emotional wounds.

00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:28.100 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we're dealing with those
emotional wounds all the time.

00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:31.310 align:middle line:10%
Because we go into
transference with each other,

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:35.510 align:middle line:10%
we project them on to each
other, and most of the time,

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:38.440 align:middle line:10%
it's very difficult
to be present,

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:40.710 align:middle line:10%
because we get triggered.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Somebody says something
and you're like--

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:43.800 align:middle line:90%
[GRUMBLES]

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.830 align:middle line:90%
Why did they say that?

00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Why are they talking about me?

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.040 align:middle line:10%
They weren't even talking about
you, but you got triggered.

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:58.390 align:middle line:84%
So, again, it is about us taking
charge, grounding our energy,

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:01.120 align:middle line:90%
making that your first priority.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Emotional stuff comes up.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.230 align:middle line:90%
OK, I feel triggered.

00:54:05.230 --> 00:54:06.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to feel the feelings.

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to recognize
that I'm triggered.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to release
that down into the Earth,

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:16.090 align:middle line:84%
down whatever chakra or gut
activated, the third chakra,

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.560 align:middle line:90%
wherever it is.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask for the
blue light of protection

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.170 align:middle line:84%
to surround me, and the silver
light, and the gold light,

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:29.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to walk around
in this fantastic blue bubble.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:32.270 align:middle line:90%
OK, you tracking with me?

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:34.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, not to contradict what
I'm saying, but I think it's

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:43.650 align:middle line:84%
always fun to throw the
other card up in the air.

00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the hardest things
for us to do on planet Earth

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:52.790 align:middle line:90%
is to say, I surrender.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Because we all really
want to be in control.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.560 align:middle line:90%
We want to control what happens.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to control
how it happens.

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.900 align:middle line:84%
We want to control who
comes into our house.

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.600 align:middle line:84%
We want to control
who drives our car.

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.340 align:middle line:84%
We want to control who's
talking to our kids.

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:84%
It's like we want
to be in control.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately, we're living
in a very, very addicted world,

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.970 align:middle line:90%
addicted society.

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:27.070 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to everything,
food, shopping, phones,

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:29.860 align:middle line:90%
alcohol, drugs.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.230 align:middle line:84%
You name it, people
are addicted.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So out of that
addiction, what happens?

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We end up wanting to control
everything, because we

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:41.710 align:middle line:90%
feel a little out of control.

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
things we can do

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.040 align:middle line:84%
is take whatever that is you're
worried about, whatever you're

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:55.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out, and
start a process of trusting

00:55:55.420 --> 00:56:03.350 align:middle line:84%
that Creator and the Earth
are much better producers,

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:07.070 align:middle line:84%
choreographers, and
directors than any of us

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.750 align:middle line:90%
ever thought of being.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:11.280 align:middle line:90%
And you have to give it up.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.850 align:middle line:90%
You have to turn it over.

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.450 align:middle line:90%
You have to say, OK, enough.

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I have worried myself
sick over this.

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:90%
You take it.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Figure it out.

00:56:20.550 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Give me a call when you got it.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.490 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, you guys, we
are not in control.

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, we so think we're
in control and we're not.

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:35.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's OK.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.080 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But that level of trust that
you hear coming out of me

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:45.920 align:middle line:90%
is years of doing inner work.

00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:49.100 align:middle line:10%
Years of talking
to my inner child,

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.640 align:middle line:10%
and holding her, and
telling her, she's OK.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:56.000 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't have to be
afraid because I'm the adult,

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.500 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to
take care of her.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:04.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm handing it back to you.

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:08.620 align:middle line:10%
It's like, it
really is up to us.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:10.990 align:middle line:10%
We have to parent
the inner child.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:12.660 align:middle line:10%
We have to take
care of ourselves

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.490 align:middle line:10%
and have clear boundaries.

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
protect ourselves,

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because, yeah, there's people
around us that will protect us,

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.020 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes
they're not around,

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and we have to protect
ourselves, right?

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:29.995 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I surrender.

00:57:29.995 --> 00:57:31.270 align:middle line:90%
Woo-hoo.

00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:32.070 align:middle line:90%
It's very freeing.

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.195 align:middle line:84%
When you really let yourself
get into that and say,

00:57:34.195 --> 00:57:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I surrender, and you just let
all that stuff go, man, you'll

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.030 align:middle line:90%
feel really good.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.200 align:middle line:90%
It's very freeing.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:48.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, I am really, really
grateful that you guys

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:52.850 align:middle line:84%
chose to come here instead
of being at the Oscars.

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much, and thank
you for going into meditation

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:03.560 align:middle line:10%
with me, and doing a
little bit of work.

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.040 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate
all that you did.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.530 align:middle line:90%
And thank you guys.

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:10.370 align:middle line:90%
You were wonderful.

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:11.170 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.040 align:middle line:90%
