00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It's my privilege, Conscious
Life Expo 2020, Daniel Estulin.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.324 align:middle line:84%
Daniel, thank you
so much, my friend.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.818 align:middle line:90%
Knock it out.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And I got my autographed book.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Good afternoon.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.588 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:30.030 align:middle line:10%
It's wonderful to be
at Conscious Life.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:10%
It's my first time.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle line:10%
Very much enjoying
what I've seen so far.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And again, very grateful
to Gaia and the Conscious

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Life Expo for the
invitation to this event.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.788 align:middle line:84%
I've been following it for
many, many years at a distance,

00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
obviously, but now
I'm participating,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very glad
that you're here.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.610 align:middle line:84%
I am a doctor of
conceptual intelligence.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.113 align:middle line:10%
What that means is that I'm
not a conspiracy theorist.

00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:54.405 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a coincidence theorist.

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:56.378 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:10%
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:10%
to deconstruct a lot of
these conspiracy theories

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.525 align:middle line:10%
out there, such as four
old geezers sitting

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:10%
in a dark room, holding hands,
staring at a crystal ball,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:10%
planning the world domination.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:10%
That kind of stuff
doesn't exist.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:10%
If you kind of go online
news, there's-- again,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:10%
because I don't follow
conspiracy theories,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:10%
I kind of wanted to see how
these global conspiracies--

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.260 align:middle line:10%
the Illuminati, the Vatican,
the Jews, the Masons--

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:10%
how all this stuff
fits into what

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340 align:middle line:10%
they understand the
world global order.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of go
online, you go on Google,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and you see these
really funny pyramids.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have the Illuminati
and the all seeing eye,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the Jews,
the 13 families, the blood

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:90%
families, the blood lines.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.930 align:middle line:84%
The world is a very
complex place, and--

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say anything
for have these people

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.460 align:middle line:90%
wildly applaud me yet.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So to think that the--

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
again, a small group of
people control the world,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:84%
or that the Bill Gates's of
this world, the Warren Buffetts,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
the Jeff Bezos's, the
alleged billionaires who

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:84%
are on the top "Forbes"
100, 550 most powerful,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
"allegedly," in
quotes, individuals

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
who run the planet, it's kind
of silly, because what I do--

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
my objective in today's
conference, more than anything

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
else, is to look at
things conceptually,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
because, again, I'm a doctor of
conceptual intelligence, which

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
means that we design models
that explain mathematically,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
scientifically,
politically, economically,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
socially, sequo-historically
the global structures,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
the constructs that go
a generation or even

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.262 align:middle line:84%
the times two
generations in advance.

00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is what I want to do.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to focus on
the conceptual element

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.990 align:middle line:84%
of global control
and kind of help

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.390 align:middle line:84%
you understand why
we are where we

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
are at this very
difficult point in time.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I had mentioned yesterday in
a roundtable with George Noory

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that what we're seeing today
was actually something similar--

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
not like this, but
something similar--

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.850 align:middle line:84%
it's only happened twice
over the past 2,000 years,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:84%
once between the fourth
and sixth century

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
when the global-- the old order,
the Roman Empire collapsed.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And you had the
rise of feudalism.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it collapsed in
476, although the empire really

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
collapsed and 550 when the
technology stopped working.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
By technology, I mean the
viaducts and the water.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And the second time between
the 16th and the 17th century,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
where the order itself survived
because it was a vertical order

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:90%
instead of horizontal.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.500 align:middle line:10%
It was between the
fourth and sixth century,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:10%
but that was the change
from the feudalist system

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.640 align:middle line:10%
to the capitalist system today.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do is I
want to give a very, very

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
brief overview from the
economic point of view

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
and help you understand the
kinds of numbers we're looking

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:90%
at and why we are where we are.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.352 align:middle line:84%
Global bubble is
about $4 quadrillion.

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
In case you're wondering
what that number

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.943 align:middle line:90%
is, that's 4 and 15 zeros.

00:04:14.943 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely
no way you can

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
print enough money to actually
write that amount of money off.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The global debt
is $235 trillion,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.420 align:middle line:90%
or 325% of global GDP.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:10%
Debt in the United States
is $22-- or what is it,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:10%
$23 trillion dollars right now?

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The European banks are
leveraged at 33 to 1,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.150 align:middle line:84%
which means that the minimal
variation in percentage

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:90%
will cause a global collapse.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.150 align:middle line:10%
In Europe, five countries--

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.850 align:middle line:10%
England, France, Germany,
Spain, and Italy--

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.820 align:middle line:10%
have debts of over $1 trillion.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, 114 out of the
top 500 banks are bankrupt.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, Deutsche
Bank and Commerzbank--

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
these are the two
biggest banks in Germany.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They have lost 90% of their
value in the stock market.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.790 align:middle line:10%
China's debt is 250
now higher of GDP.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:10%
In the United States, you
have 100 million people out

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:10%
of work in the United States.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know this.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.530 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, again, go online.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:middle line:90%
Just Google it.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
100 million people out
of work, and 50 million

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
survive thanks to coupons
in the United States.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The misery index, which is
a very important index--

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
it's a CIA index.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the few
that I really follow.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the real unemployment
and real inflation,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.212 align:middle line:90%
and that's at 32.89.

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Just to give you an
idea as a comparison,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
during the Great Depression--
the darkest, deepest point

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Depression--
it was at 27,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
so we've gone beyond that.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve has
$56 billion in cash,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:90%
and $23 in debt.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.325 align:middle line:90%
The Fed is leveraged at 87 to 1.

00:05:55.325 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're
talking about leverage,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.450 align:middle line:90%
the global average is about 3%.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The way it works is
that the US banks--

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:84%
they must have a
certain capital.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
understand how--

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.430 align:middle line:84%
what the whole point
of leverage is--

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is it's a ratio of how much cash
you have to the amount of debt

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:90%
you have.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So for every dollar in cash
that the bank holds in reserve,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.360 align:middle line:84%
the bank can lend about 25,
which means it's 4% leverage--

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.640 align:middle line:90%
1 in 25.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve is
leveraged at 87 to 1,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
which means the-- it's
hopelessly, absolutely,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:90%
hopelessly bankrupt.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We have come to this point
economically for a very simple

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:90%
reason.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.480 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the global
economy over the last 120, 130,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:10%
150 years, we've--

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:10%
in the 19th century, we've had
four different economic models.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.710 align:middle line:10%
We had the British economic
model in the 1840s.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:10%
Then you have the Prussian,
or the German after war

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:10%
with France in
1870, the American

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:10%
at the end of the 19th century,
and the Japanese in 1904, 1905

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:10%
after the war with
czarist Russia, which

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.760 align:middle line:10%
was really a continuation of
the Meiji model back in 1868.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end
of World War II,

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.468 align:middle line:90%
these four models became two.

00:07:09.468 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
We had capitalist West
and socialist Soviet Union

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:90%
and the satellites.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And these two models-- they
coexisted fairly well between

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.475 align:middle line:90%
1944--

00:07:18.475 --> 00:07:20.573 align:middle line:90%
that's Bretton Woods in 1991.

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:10%
In certain aspects,
the West was better,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:10%
and in other aspects,
especially social and welfare,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.770 align:middle line:10%
the Soviet-- the satellite--
the socialist countries

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:10%
were better.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Demographically, they
were very similar,

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
because the Soviet Union
at the time had 300--

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:90%
a little bit over--

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:90%
million people.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And the United States, 220.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
But more or less, it was an
evenly leveraged models--

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
the Western capitalist
and the Soviet Socialist.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1991, these two
models merged into one.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.800 align:middle line:10%
The Soviet Union
collapse goes way

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:10%
beyond the scope of
this presentation,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:10%
but suffice to say that,
when these two models merged

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:10%
into one global model, the
economic global model became

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:10%
known as the liberal
banking financier model.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:10%
As we have one blue sky
over the entire planet,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.522 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't matter whether
United States and Australia--

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:10%
is that the same thing with the
liberal banking financier, Wall

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:10%
Street, parasitical model
based on infinite growth

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.750 align:middle line:10%
on a finite planet.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:10%
And that lasted between 1981
with the collapse of the Soviet

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:10%
Union up until
about the year 2008,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:30.013 align:middle line:10%
when we had the Lehman Brothers
collapse, or the subprime,

00:08:30.013 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:10%
as they call it, which
really wasn't subprime.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:10%
It was the collapse of
the global economic model.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:10%
And this collapse almost brought
the entire world economy down.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:10%
We were able to stave
off the global collapse

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:10%
as a result of a lot of
financial shenanigans

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:10%
by all the central banks
in the world, et cetera.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.200 align:middle line:10%
So instead of taking
advantage of the 2008

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.930 align:middle line:10%
global financial
collapse to not only

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:10%
stave of the future
collapse, but actually

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:04.420 align:middle line:10%
to save the system, the
bankers went 70% more in debt.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:10.420 align:middle line:10%
And what basically we have
today is the very last stage

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:10%
of this global systemic
financial collapse, something

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:10%
which is absolutely unavoidable.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.845 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're
looking at right now--

00:09:18.845 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't matter whether
you're living in the United

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.223 align:middle line:10%
States, or you're
living in Canada,

00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:10%
or you're living
in South America.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:10%
Anywhere you point
on the global map--

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:10%
the entire world is in
a state of collapse.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
If you discount Africa,
which itself-- there's

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
54 countries in Africa, and 33
of them are at war with itself,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:84%
some with terrorists, other with
each other, regional conflicts,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.663 align:middle line:84%
Globally, there is 48
additional conflicts,

00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:44.830 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking about
the United States, which

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
is a country totally
divided on itself--

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
you can't say it's a
homogeneous country, because you

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:90%
know very well that it is not.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
In Canada, you have
Western provinces

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:90%
want to secede from the union.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
be part of Canada.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.063 align:middle line:10%
Mexico is at war with
the narco cartels.

00:10:00.063 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:10%
Latin America--
where do we start?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:10%
Colombia, where 3/4
of the population

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.275 align:middle line:10%
is up in arms against
the president, who

00:10:06.275 --> 00:10:09.622 align:middle line:10%
is a product of the
International Monetary Fund.

00:10:09.622 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:10%
In Ecuador, they're burning
half of the country down.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:10%
Peru, if you go down the coast,
they don't have a president.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:16.732 align:middle line:90%
They don't have a government.

00:10:16.732 --> 00:10:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Chile-- they've already
burned half the country down.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:10%
Bolivia just had a coup
d'etat, the way they got rid

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:10%
of the legitimate president.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.570 align:middle line:10%
They put somebody else in
their place who is right--

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:10%
extreme right wing dictator--

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.128 align:middle line:10%
Nazi dictatorship.

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.295 align:middle line:10%
Now, in Argentina, they
just flipped the government.

00:10:30.295 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:10%
In Uruguay, they just
flipped the government.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Venezuela-- well, what can
you say about Venezuela?

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:10%
Let's cross the Atlantic.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.855 align:middle line:90%
We have England with Brexit.

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
We have France with
the yellow jackets.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They've been up in arms
for 66, 67 straight weeks--

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:84%
out on the streets every
Saturday for the past 67 weeks.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:10%
That's a year and three
months out of the street.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Germany is-- you have the
rise of the extreme right wing

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:90%
parties.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
In Italy, half of
the country also

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.220 align:middle line:90%
wants to secede from the union.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
In Spain, you have the Catalan
and new Basque separatists

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to create
their own country.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.630 align:middle line:84%
They're not really
part of Spain anymore.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The Nordic countries--
they're all

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
run by socialist
democratic parties,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
and the problem with
these countries is they've

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:84%
been overrun by
third world refugees.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:90%
Russia-- let's not go--

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:90%
even go into that.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:10%
They just got-- Putin just
got rid of the government.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.985 align:middle line:84%
China-- well, we have
coronavirus in China.

00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll go to
the Middle East.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:90%
You have Israel.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:90%
You have Syria.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%
You have Libya.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.820 align:middle line:90%
You have Iran.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:90%
You have Iraq.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
You have Afghanistan.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%
You have Sri Lanka.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.210 align:middle line:90%
You have Yemen.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
You have Saudi Arabia, Pakistan.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
Australia, which

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is halfway-- it is being
burnt down to the ground.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that-- why
all this stuff is happening--

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is God punishing us
because we're so bad?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:10%
But the point is that
we have to understand--

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:10%
you have to understand that
what we're seeing right now

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:10%
is an absolutely inevitable
conclusion to a very

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:10%
long economic model, which
is now on its deathbed.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.642 align:middle line:84%
And the problem we
have today globally--

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:09.100 align:middle line:84%
and globally I mean anywhere
on the planet-- because again,

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
the people--

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
whether it is before--
as I said before,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
if-- between '44 and 1991,
you had two economic models.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
They had their own--
its own language,

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
its own way of
understanding economy,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
social justice, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
In 1991, these two
models merged into one

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:84%
global financial
model, and that model

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
became known as liberal
banking financier,

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.770 align:middle line:90%
Wall Street, parasitical model.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.163 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
kind of at who runs

00:12:36.163 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
all of the countries
in the world,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.663 align:middle line:90%
these are the same people.

00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:10%
It's not a question
of whether it's

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:10%
the liberals or the
conservatives in Canada,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.415 align:middle line:10%
the Republicans
or the Democrats,

00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:10%
because, again, look
at the United States.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.883 align:middle line:90%
I live in Canada.

00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We have the same
problems you have here,

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.480 align:middle line:84%
as every other country has
everywhere else in the world,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.253 align:middle line:84%
because they're all
run by the same money,

00:12:55.253 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and that's very
important to understand.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.455 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely no
difference between Republican

00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:00.520 align:middle line:90%
and Democratic Party.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.937 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is abortion,
how they understand that.

00:13:02.937 --> 00:13:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is
exactly the same.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But people who run these parties
globally are the same people.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the liberal
banking financier order,

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and what you're seeing
on the world stage today

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
is the fight to the death for
the control of the only thing

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.980 align:middle line:84%
that all these elites globally
have tried to control,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care if we're
talking about ancient Egypt

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:84%
or talking about Western and
Eastern Byzantine Empire.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It's the emission center--

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
to speak in the
parlance of slang,

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a little machine
that prints money.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
The Federal Reserve does.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.190 align:middle line:84%
They do that in the
Bank of England.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
They do that in
Europe, et cetera.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:10%
But that mechanism--
the control mechanism,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:10%
the emission center no
longer provides the benefits

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.250 align:middle line:10%
as it did before.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So the problem right
now is they need

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
to come up with an
alternative economic model,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and there is no language
to describe that model,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:90%
because the entire world--

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.300 align:middle line:84%
since 1944, the Western, and
since 1991, the entire world--

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.745 align:middle line:84%
is speaking the same
language, and that language

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is of liberal
banking financiers.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And that language is
devoid of any content.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So whether we're talking
about the government,

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.683 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
about the bureaucracy,

00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
whether we're talking
about the intelligence

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:84%
apparatus, the think tanks,
the foundations, Wharton

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
School of Business, London
School of Economics,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't care where you are.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
That language is
on its deathbed,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.720 align:middle line:84%
because the model
is on its deathbed.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can't solve
global problems

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:38.060 align:middle line:84%
using the language
that's no longer valid,

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
a language-- you

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
meaning the world,
especially Western world.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't have the language,
because you've been speaking

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:90%
the language which now dead.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
They need to decide what
this world post-crisis is

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:90%
going to look like.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.427 align:middle line:84%
They need for the winners of
this global conflict-- what

00:14:57.427 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:84%
there is again-- and
at the end of World War

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:84%
II, the great powers, the United
States, England, and the Soviet

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Union-- they sat down to decide
what this world will look

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:84%
like post-war to decide
political boundaries,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
economic conditions,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
The same thing needs
to be done right now.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:10%
The only problem is, whereas
before these countries won

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.370 align:middle line:10%
the war against other nations--

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:10%
whether it's Spain, whether it's
Germany, whether it's Japan--

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.200 align:middle line:10%
today what you're looking
at-- it's a massless image.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:10%
It's not a country that
the world is fighting.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a liberal, global,
financial order.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And so it needs
to be decided who

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
is going to sit at this
proverbial round table,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
because again, if you
look at the winners, who

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:90%
are the winners?

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, Russia is obviously
one of the winners,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.105 align:middle line:84%
and Putin is going
to represent Russia.

00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Think of a roundtable.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And then China is going
to have their president,

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:90%
and that's Premier Xi Jinping.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
India, as one of the biggest
countries in the world with

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.260 align:middle line:84%
almost 2 billion
people-- they say 1.3,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
but I'm sure it's a lot
more than 1.3 billion--

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:90%
with two billion people.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.772 align:middle line:84%
And then the United States is
also going to sit at the table.

00:16:05.772 --> 00:16:08.770 align:middle line:84%
The question is, who is going
to represent the United States?

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.412 align:middle line:84%
Who is going to
sit in that chair?

00:16:10.412 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to
say United States?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.953 align:middle line:90%
Who is going to sit there?

00:16:12.953 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly, the President
of the United States,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
except the President
of United States

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.128 align:middle line:84%
is not in control of
the United States.

00:16:19.128 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, had he been in
control, impeachment

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.070 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have happened.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.653 align:middle line:84%
They didn't impeach
him, but the point

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
is there is a war of
attrition in America,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.550 align:middle line:84%
as is in every other
country in the world,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:90%
for control of the dialectic.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And so, before somebody
sits in that chair,

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
they need to decide who is going
to represent the United States.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.870 align:middle line:90%
That's one aspect to it.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Another aspect of it--
and I'll talk about it.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We have lots of time
as we delve into some

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
of the other aspects
of global, financial,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.600 align:middle line:84%
or political order in the
world of post-crisis--

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.100 align:middle line:84%
is you have to understand
that, when you're talking what

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
control, most people
understand it as countries

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.422 align:middle line:90%
or special interests.

00:17:01.422 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And by special interests, we're
talking about George Soros.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.019 align:middle line:84%
If I said you, so who are
the powerful billionaires who

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:90%
control--

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
people would say George
Soros, or Jeff Bezos,

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.714 align:middle line:90%
or Bill Gates, Warren Buffett.

00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And I'd ask you,
well, why do you

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:18.459 align:middle line:84%
think that these people actually
have any control whatsoever?

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:19.834 align:middle line:84%
You'd say, well,
because they are

00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:90%
very rich and very powerful.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Kim Kardashian has
a lot of money.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean she is
very powerful, as well?

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.060 align:middle line:84%
I know it sounds like a
really stupid question,

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:90%
and I'm being obviously cynical.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that power
and wealth are two very,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:90%
very different things.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.982 align:middle line:84%
People understand
power as somebody

00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:39.940 align:middle line:90%
who has a lot of money.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.350 align:middle line:90%
That's not the case.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Money is money, and when--
again, when we think of money,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
and you think of "Forbes" and
the top 500 names, or whatever,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.330 align:middle line:84%
100 names on the "Forbes" list,
you have to understand that

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
"Forbes"-- they made their money
in the drug trade back with

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:90%
the clipper ships in China.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.910 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:90%
They did.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the history
of the Forbes family,

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.988 align:middle line:84%
they made all their money
with the clipper ships--

00:18:03.988 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that instead of one shipment,
they were able to do two.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:10%
So they became insanely
rich in the opium trade.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And all the wealthy
American families--

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
the Lodges, et
cetera, et cetera--

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.410 align:middle line:84%
they all their money in the
same thing-- the Harrimans.

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:10%
So but again, when
you think of wealth,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:10%
people tend to think what?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.360 align:middle line:10%
The Rockefellers-- you
say, who is wealthy?

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.520 align:middle line:10%
The Rockefellers.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.010 align:middle line:10%
Or somebody is going to say,
no, man, it's the Rothschilds.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an all seeing eye,
the Masonic pyramid.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.590 align:middle line:90%
They control that thing.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But again, how long have the
Rockefellers been around?

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for 150 years, right?

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not very long from
a historical point of view.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The Rothschilds-- they've
been around for 250 years.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot more wealth,
but there is another family--

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:90%
for example, the Baruchs.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.937 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of them?

00:18:51.937 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
since the fifth century.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, they're the founders
of Standard Chartered Bank.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.920 align:middle line:84%
If any of you are
from England or you

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.090 align:middle line:84%
like football, European soccer,
then on Liverpool t-shirts

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:90%
it says Standard Chartered Bank.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:10%
It was founded in 1613,
about literally to the day

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:10%
that the Romanov dynasty
ascended to the throne

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:10%
in Russia, except that
the Romanovs were killed

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:10%
300 years later,
and the Baruchs just

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:10%
celebrated their
400th anniversary.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And they go back to
the fifth century.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And their wealth is not
measured in millions of dollars

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:90%
and billions of dollars.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's measured in hundreds
of trillions of dollars,

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's the real wealth.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's very-- again,
money like silence--

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:90%
have you ever heard that phrase?

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.557 align:middle line:84%
I lived in
Switzerland, and anyone

00:19:38.557 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
who has ever been to
Switzerland understands

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.115 align:middle line:90%
that very, very well.

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:90%
People have a lot of money.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't show.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not an ostentatious thing.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.050 align:middle line:10%
It's like a football player
who wears a $100,000 watch.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, they may
wear a $15 swatch,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.970 align:middle line:84%
but they've got $40, $50
trillion in the bank,

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:90%
and you would never know it.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:01.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the real money.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking about,
again, wealthy families, you

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
have to-- again, this
is the kind of stuff,

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.700 align:middle line:84%
if you're interested--
and one of the things

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I like about the
Conscious Life Expo

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:84%
is a chance to learn, and
understand how things work,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.922 align:middle line:84%
and try to put it
together in perspective.

00:20:16.922 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:10%
So if you're really
interested in understanding

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:10%
not superficially, not to
just say a couple of names

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.830 align:middle line:10%
and impress your
friends, but to really

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:10%
understand how power
structures work,

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:10%
start deconstructing
all these all

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:10%
seeing eye triangles you
see on the internet--

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:10%
that the CIA is there at
the top of the pyramid

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:10%
with the Illuminati,
et cetera, et

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:10%
cetera, because the global
structure is a very, very

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.200 align:middle line:10%
different thing.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we're
talking about power,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
power isn't measured
in hundreds of years.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You can go back-- the same,
for example-- the people who

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
ran Egypt back 2,500
or 3,000 years ago--

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:90%
they weren't the pharaohs.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.925 align:middle line:84%
They were the high priests, and
those high priests-- today they

00:20:56.925 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
live in Switzerland,
which is why Switzerland

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:90%
is an untouchable territory.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything to it.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the getaways
for the global elites.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
It's understood these are
the rules of the game,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and the rules of the game
is a very important part

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.547 align:middle line:90%
of how the elite play the game.

00:21:12.547 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things you can
do, certain things you can't.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.572 align:middle line:90%
The elite are untouchable.

00:21:16.572 --> 00:21:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I say the elite, I'm
not talking about Jeff Bezos.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about what's
his name, Bill Gates, or Warren

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Buffett.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking
about these people.

00:21:24.688 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
The elite is not
personal wealth.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:90%
It's called fondi.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It's an Italian word, and
fondi is a family fund.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's when you pool
your money together.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look at
the fondis, for example,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240 align:middle line:84%
the Rothschilds--
their real wealth,

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
not this imaginary
"Forbes" top 500 wealth--

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.050 align:middle line:90%
is about $3.2 trillion.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:50.890 align:middle line:84%
The Rockefellers have
about $2.8 trillion.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.105 align:middle line:10%
The Baruchs have
infinitely more money,

00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and there are families that
you've never even heard

00:21:55.230 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:10%
of-- the Bardis, the Paruzis,
the Dorias, the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:10%
Italian old Venetian
black nobility

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.970 align:middle line:10%
of families whose wealth goes
back about 800, 900 years.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done
not too long ago--

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I think about six or seven years
ago by a British investigator.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:90%
I think he was Australian, or--

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.590 align:middle line:90%
I think it was Australian.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:10%
And what they've discovered is
they traced British wealth back

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:10%
to about 1076, and
when they found out

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:35.160 align:middle line:10%
that 1% has owned 63% of wealth
for the past 1,000 years.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:90%
That's wealth.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.447 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not
going to read this

00:22:37.447 --> 00:22:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in the cover of "Time"
magazine, or "The Economist,"

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
or "Wall Street Journal,"
"The New York Times."

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.880 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to see
a Twitter feed dealing

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.478 align:middle line:10%
with this money like
silence, but this

00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:49.020 align:middle line:10%
is-- when you're
talking about power,

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:10%
this is the kind of
power that you really

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.850 align:middle line:10%
have to understand is
actually what runs the world,

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:10%
not the piddly little stuff
that we're talking about.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:10%
So again, when we're
talking about power,

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:10%
think of it as an
inverted triangle.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Talking about wealth, the
bottom part of the triangle,

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.595 align:middle line:84%
this is the money that
goes back over 500 years.

00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And again, if you're
really interested,

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.428 align:middle line:90%
you can look at the heraldry.

00:23:13.428 --> 00:23:15.480 align:middle line:10%
Look at the family
history of some

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.240 align:middle line:10%
of these old Italian
dynasties going back

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.342 align:middle line:10%
to the Venetian black nobility,
going back to the period

00:23:21.342 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:10%
before the Black
Plague, going back

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:10%
to the period of
Charlemagne in the 800s.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:10%
You have to understand
that this has wealth.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:10%
For the same reason, again,
you say, well, Princess Diana--

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:10%
she married into--
she didn't marry into.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:10%
It's the Windsors who
married into her family,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:10%
because the Stuarts,
the Spencers-- they're

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:10%
the direct descendants of the
Merovingian dynasty, which

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.032 align:middle line:10%
is the Benjamin, which is one
of the 12 tribes of Israel.

00:23:49.032 --> 00:23:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you saw "The
Da Vinci Code,"

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.890 align:middle line:84%
if you remember when they
talked about the Jesus Christ

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
bloodline, well, these
are the Merovingians.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So again, when we're
talking about wealth,

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
the elite speak in the
language of signs and symbols.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm a doctor of
conceptual intelligence.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:10%
A bit later, I'll explain
to you how that works,

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:09.360 align:middle line:10%
but the point is
that conceptualist

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:10%
is about governments.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.910 align:middle line:10%
It's about legislatures.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.620 align:middle line:10%
It's about judiciary.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:10%
It's understanding
things from there.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:10%
It's you're in a
satellite flying

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.460 align:middle line:10%
over-- about 200
kilometers overhead,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:10%
and you're taking
everything in, and you're

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.163 align:middle line:10%
putting it and
building into a model,

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:10%
because it's important to
understand that everything

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.690 align:middle line:10%
works on a model basis.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.450 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing-- the
easy way out, four old geezers

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.570 align:middle line:84%
sitting in a dark
room, holding hands,

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.610 align:middle line:84%
staring at a crystal ball,
planning the world's domination

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
by pressing a button, like
remember in the old Batman

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and Robin cartoons
from the 1960s.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.140 align:middle line:90%
It really doesn't exist.

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.005 align:middle line:84%
But that said, if
you look a lot--

00:24:49.005 --> 00:24:51.930 align:middle line:84%
if you see a lot of
the current films,

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.620 align:middle line:84%
like for example James
bond films, when you're

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.690 align:middle line:84%
talking about SPECTRE
as an organization,

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that's how power
structures work.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a pyramid, as
much it is a concentric system.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:10%
It's like an onion,
where all these think

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:10%
tanks, organizations, powerful
secret private societies--

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:10%
they kind of merged like this.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.160 align:middle line:84%
As you start peeling
all that stuff off,

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:19.330 align:middle line:90%
you get to the nitty gritty.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
You get to the crux of what
these people really represent.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But again, if you take
an inverted pyramid,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.840 align:middle line:90%
the bottom part, the 0.01%--

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
these are the people that have
been around at least 500 years.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:34.858 align:middle line:90%
That's wealth.

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
The Windsors-- they've
been around for 300 years.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.733 align:middle line:90%
They're not wealthy.

00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:90%
That's not power.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
the proverbial round table,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:84%
where the people who've run
the world for the past 2,000

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.980 align:middle line:90%
3,000 years--

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:90%
this is not a conspiracy theory.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.100 align:middle line:10%
If you look at Solomon's plan,
if you look at the Taoists

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.020 align:middle line:10%
in China, they've been
pushing their project

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.465 align:middle line:10%
for the past 3,000 years.

00:25:57.465 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at
this proverbial round

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:10%
table of global power, who is
going to sit at that table?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Bill Gates, not even close.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only-- for example,
in the history of Russia,

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
the only family who
would sit at that table

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.220 align:middle line:90%
were the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
You may not know who they
are, but they've ruled

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Russia for 21 generations.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.390 align:middle line:90%
A generation is 20, 25 years.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Well, just start adding it
up, going back to about 762.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that--
and then they lost power

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.560 align:middle line:90%
to the Romanovs.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.720 align:middle line:84%
The Romanovs were
all killed, and so we

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.080 align:middle line:84%
have no representatives
at the round table,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but now paradoxically with
the global economic collapse

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.850 align:middle line:90%
we finally have a chance--

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Russia has finally a
chance to actually put

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.793 align:middle line:84%
their own representative
at this table.

00:26:46.793 --> 00:26:48.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when you're
talking about-- you say,

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.490 align:middle line:90%
oh, Putin is powerful.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:90%
He's-- but again, is he really?

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:90%
What makes him powerful?

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Just imagine this.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:10%
So you have the Queen of
England, who have been there

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:10%
for 300 years as a family.

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And you have Putin.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And she says, Mr. Putin,
you've done a very good job

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:90%
for the past 20 years.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:10.000 align:middle line:84%
You are well respected,
well regarded.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
You're a very
powerful politician.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.970 align:middle line:90%
And Putin says, da.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And she says, but
my question is,

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.120 align:middle line:84%
are you going to be around
for the next 20 years?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:10%
And Putin is almost
70 years old,

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.510 align:middle line:10%
so unless he lives to
be 90, which doesn't

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.445 align:middle line:10%
mean he's going to be around.

00:27:24.445 --> 00:27:26.320 align:middle line:10%
He's probably going to
say, I don't think so.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:10%
I may be around for another
four or five years, maybe eight.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.470 align:middle line:10%
But 20?

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.507 align:middle line:10%
How about in 100 years?

00:27:32.507 --> 00:27:34.590 align:middle line:10%
Are you going to be around
for the next 500 years?

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.410 align:middle line:10%
So the point is, again,
it's not individual power,

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:10%
because power, if you
kind of thing of it,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.120 align:middle line:10%
is an ebb and flow.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
It works in a four
generation basis.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.210 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
You have your grandfather
came from Sicily to the United

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.627 align:middle line:84%
States looking
for a better life.

00:27:51.627 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
He worked very hard, put
his kids through college.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:90%
His dad had a good job.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.290 align:middle line:84%
His son or his grandson
made something of himself,

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.500 align:middle line:90%
became very rich.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And then his grandson--
he passed it off to him,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.667 align:middle line:90%
and then he lost everything.

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And we go back to the
same cycle, right?

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.850 align:middle line:90%
This is basically how it works.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a four generation
cycle, which

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:12.670 align:middle line:84%
is why, if you kind of look
at the Saudi Arabian Bedouins,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.828 align:middle line:84%
you know that this
thing is over for them.

00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:90%
They have absolutely no future.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:84%
After this generation,
the next one is gone.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
They go back to herding camels.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you kind of
look at, again, the power

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
structures, when you
start understanding things

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:29.605 align:middle line:90%
in these terms--

00:28:29.605 --> 00:28:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:37.140 align:middle line:84%
when people say Hillary Clinton,
or George Soros, or Bill Gates,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.357 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard
that Bill Gates said--

00:28:39.357 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't-- I can't remember when.

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:46.055 align:middle line:84%
He said that, when he dies he'd
like to donate 90% of his money

00:28:46.055 --> 00:28:47.930 align:middle line:84%
to some-- have you ever
heard of that, right?

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I know most people
say, he's such a generous

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.920 align:middle line:90%
God, I love that man.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:90%
He's wonderful.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.920 align:middle line:10%
But again, I was taught--

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.200 align:middle line:10%
because I come from
a different world.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:90%
I come from the Soviet Union.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And where there's-- the West
has their way of thinking.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Their way of thinking
is abstract thinking.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese way of thinking
is concrete symbolic,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:90%
because it's hieroglyphs.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.010 align:middle line:84%
Our way of thinking is
three partita symmetrical,

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:90%
which is body, soul, and mind.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very
different approach

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.450 align:middle line:84%
to how we understand and
interpret information.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.190 align:middle line:10%
So when I-- from-- with what
I know after studying these

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.550 align:middle line:10%
structures for the
past 25 years--

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:10%
so when you look
at Bill Gates is

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.750 align:middle line:10%
willing to give up
90% of his wealth,

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:44.590 align:middle line:10%
have any of you ever thought
that perhaps the money is not

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:10%
his to begin with, and
he is just a part time

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:10%
temporary custodian
of that wealth?

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.390 align:middle line:10%
He's just the face of the
people who really run that money

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:10%
globally, because, again, if
you think how much money there

00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.645 align:middle line:10%
is out there--

00:29:59.645 --> 00:30:01.270 align:middle line:10%
I have-- for example,
I have an extract

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:10%
from the-- have you ever heard
of the German industrialists

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.180 align:middle line:10%
from the 19th century
called the Krupps?

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:10%
K-R-U-P-P. You have?

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Some.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:10%
If you live in Europe,
you take an escalator

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.243 align:middle line:10%
or take an elevator, it's
always of Thyssenkrupp.

00:30:16.243 --> 00:30:17.910 align:middle line:10%
Thyssen is another
German industrialist.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:10%
They have a very famous museum
in Madrid, the Thyssen museum.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.120 align:middle line:10%
So the Krupps were
the first lords

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:10%
of war, the biggest arms
merchants in the 19th century.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:10%
They're one of the key families
that financed and sponsored

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.630 align:middle line:10%
Hitler in World War II.

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.280 align:middle line:10%
And I have one extract of one
bank account of Baron Krupp.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.140 align:middle line:10%
There's $112 billion.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.260 align:middle line:10%
And I found 3,024 bank accounts.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I was able to
find 3,024 bank accounts,

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.680 align:middle line:10%
I have no doubts whatsoever
it probably has 300,000 bank

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.870 align:middle line:10%
accounts, or 30,000, I don't.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:10%
Know It would be silly to assume
that I found all of his bank

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.650 align:middle line:10%
accounts, which means that,
if in one bank account

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.810 align:middle line:10%
there is $112 billion, and
you start adding it up--

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:10%
I don't care how much money
there is other bank accounts.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:10%
Just to give you an
idea, to think back

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:10%
that the Soros's
and the Buffetts

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:10%
with their $30, $40, $20,
$50 billion in wealth--

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.510 align:middle line:10%
it is funny, and
it is really silly

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.400 align:middle line:10%
to think that these
people actually

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:10%
have any control
over global affairs.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.500 align:middle line:90%
They're faces.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:90%
Money loves silence.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.697 align:middle line:84%
And real money-- you will never
see it, because it's old money,

00:31:31.697 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:90%
and that's the difference.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.720 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
today globally is also

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
the fight between old money,
which is, again, people

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.970 align:middle line:84%
who've had that money
for 1,000 years.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.340 align:middle line:90%
There were no stock markets.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.710 align:middle line:84%
There were no Wall
Street 1,000 years ago.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:90%
That money is in land.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.760 align:middle line:90%
That money is in goodwill.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:84%
That's their wealth, and they
will never lose that money.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
happens to the stock market.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:84%
What you do have to understand--
that will the coming collapse,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.980 align:middle line:84%
the people who have all their
billions of dollars in zeros

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.020 align:middle line:90%
and ones in the stock market--

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
as of 1929, they're going
to be broke and bankrupt.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.180 align:middle line:10%
One day, they are billionaires
on a piece of paper,

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:10%
and the next day, as in
1929, they're helplessly

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:20.788 align:middle line:10%
and hopelessly broke and
living on the street.

00:32:20.788 --> 00:32:22.580 align:middle line:10%
And this is exactly
what's going to happen.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:31.160 align:middle line:10%
So again, you have to understand
this global fight, or conflict,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.860 align:middle line:10%
or confrontation
between not only

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.040 align:middle line:10%
the liberal banking
financiers on the one hand

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.460 align:middle line:10%
and the industrialists
on the other--

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:10%
and the difference
is the financiers--

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:10%
they play with
numbers on a computer.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.760 align:middle line:84%
They don't produce any wealth,
and industrialists actually

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.170 align:middle line:90%
produce wealth.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.800 align:middle line:84%
They improve the lives of people
per square kilometer of space

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.845 align:middle line:90%
against nature.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:54.470 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that
they're good guys,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.420 align:middle line:10%
and these are the bad guys.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.530 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing people say.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:90%
So this is the good guy.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:58.413 align:middle line:90%
This is the bad guy.

00:32:58.413 --> 00:32:59.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.700 align:middle line:10%
It's like saying, who do you
want to be eaten by, the--

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:10%
Godzilla or King Kong?

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.040 align:middle line:90%
Let's not simplify things.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.010 align:middle line:84%
I know it's much easier just
to straighten the line out.

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's not simplify things.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:10%
Thinking is hard.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.900 align:middle line:10%
Thinking conceptually
is very, very hard.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.010 align:middle line:10%
But if you really want to
understand how things work,

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:10%
you have to put in the effort.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.450 align:middle line:10%
Drawing some silly you know
three dimensional pyramid

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:10%
and saying
Illuminati, all seeing

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:10%
eye, wherever else you can--

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.260 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't work like that.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.680 align:middle line:84%
So again, the old money
is 500 years or more.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Second level will be
between 150 and 300 years,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and that will be the Windsors,
the Queen of England,

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
some of the other
European Royalty,

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:90%
the Habsburgs, for example--

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
the Wallenbergs in Sweden,
very powerful family.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Then we're talking about young
money, which is less than 150.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.810 align:middle line:90%
That's the Rockefellers.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:56.450 align:middle line:84%
You'd say Rockefellers
are very powerful.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, powerful when you compare
it to how much money we have.

00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they're very powerful.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.822 align:middle line:84%
But globally,
they're not powerful,

00:34:02.822 --> 00:34:04.280 align:middle line:84%
because, again,
money is one thing.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Power is another.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.449 align:middle line:10%
The difference is that,
when you have power,

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.177 align:middle line:10%
you can pick up the phone.

00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:10%
And as you're sitting in your
veranda with a drinky poo

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.360 align:middle line:10%
in your hand
overlooking a sunset,

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.030 align:middle line:10%
you can change a whole
slew of global events

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:10%
overnight, because
you have power.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.960 align:middle line:10%
You make a phone call, and
all the sequence of events

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:29.449 align:middle line:10%
start taking place, as if
by some weird planetary

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:31.370 align:middle line:10%
universal coincidence.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.609 align:middle line:10%
But it's not.

00:34:32.609 --> 00:34:33.409 align:middle line:10%
That's power.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:10%
No Rockefeller can ever do that.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.110 align:middle line:10%
Although, yes, between
the 19th and 20th century,

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:10%
the war has been
between the Rockefellers

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.409 align:middle line:10%
and the Rothschilds, but
this is just the surface.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:46.820 align:middle line:10%
We talk about the Rothschilds
because the people

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:10%
who really control things--

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:49.580 align:middle line:10%
they're in the shadows.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.620 align:middle line:10%
You can't see them.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.840 align:middle line:10%
And we're not even talking
about the Asian clans.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:00.000 align:middle line:10%
I mean, China-- that's a
5,000 year old civilization.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.290 align:middle line:84%
It is the epicenter
of the world.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not America.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:10%
It's China.

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.275 align:middle line:84%
They've been around
for 5,000 years.

00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:10%
Do you guys understand
what that means?

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.720 align:middle line:90%
And these people are frugal.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.240 align:middle line:84%
They know how to save
their entire history.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not written on
a piece of paper.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It's etched in granite,
which is why nothing is ever

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.140 align:middle line:90%
lost in China.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:31.340 align:middle line:10%
And we can talk about
the Middle Eastern--

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.350 align:middle line:10%
for example, they
would go to Turkey.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.030 align:middle line:90%
They go to Iran.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these people--

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Sasanian empire--
They've been around

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.280 align:middle line:84%
since the sixth,
seventh sanctuaries.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.800 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about the--

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.990 align:middle line:84%
red caliphate Sufi
[? Tariqatis ?] in Turkey.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.030 align:middle line:84%
These people have been around
for over 1,000 years, the Sufi

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:90%
[? Tariqatis. ?] That's wealth.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Nobody ever talks about them.

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We always talk
about George Soros.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Because it's easy.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's easy because
everybody talks about Soros is

00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:05.920 align:middle line:84%
doing that, and he's doing
this, and open society.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.300 align:middle line:10%
And again, this
is just one level,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.930 align:middle line:10%
but when you start
looking at other stuff,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.160 align:middle line:10%
the real fight is not
between-- it's not even

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.840 align:middle line:10%
between us and them.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.380 align:middle line:90%
Who is them?

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The lizard people,
the shape shifters.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:22.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.770 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen them.

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.680 align:middle line:84%
I work in the realm of
conceptual intelligence, things

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.540 align:middle line:90%
that I can touch and prove.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And some things I can't touch,
but because I understand

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.190 align:middle line:84%
how things work
conceptually, I can

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:84%
predict what's going to happen
based on the information

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:37.670 align:middle line:90%
and history.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.040 align:middle line:84%
And history is not
a linear thing.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.640 align:middle line:10%
It became linear in 1582 when
Paul Gregorio-- he made this--

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.160 align:middle line:10%
the history into a
linear progression--

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.120 align:middle line:10%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, et cetera.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But the Chinese
history is not linear.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a sum of different waves
of different periods of time.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.240 align:middle line:84%
It's the ebbs and flows,
and the Chinese history

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:84%
is very different
from Western history.

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Their language of
history is different.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They understand global concepts
in a very different way.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.540 align:middle line:84%
So to try to impose
Western democracy

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
on the Chinese way of
thinking is absolutely silly.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.568 align:middle line:90%
It makes no sense whatsoever.

00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going to go into
whether it's good or bad.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.670 align:middle line:10%
It's just-- it's impossible,
because they don't speak

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:middle line:10%
your language, and
you have no idea

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.350 align:middle line:10%
what they are, because you
can't read hieroglyphs,

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:10%
because hieroglyphs
are not letters.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They're visual
representations of reality,

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.420 align:middle line:84%
and their reality is very
different from your reality.

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.640 align:middle line:10%
So what I'm trying
to say is that,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.460 align:middle line:10%
when you try to understand
and decipher-- again, this--

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.770 align:middle line:10%
in the sense it's--

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:47.710 align:middle line:10%
the Conscious Life Expo
is a wonderful platform

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:49.690 align:middle line:10%
to actually discuss all
these different things

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.083 align:middle line:10%
from very different
perspectives,

00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:53.500 align:middle line:10%
whether you're
talking or portals,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:56.260 align:middle line:10%
you're talking about UFOs,
you're talking about whatever.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Everybody-- as my
publisher, Chris Milligan,

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.160 align:middle line:84%
always says, everyone brings
something to the table.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And between us, we can try
to figure it out, or at least

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.410 align:middle line:84%
get a better understanding
of how things work.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So again, and as I said before,
it's not between us and them.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.610 align:middle line:10%
It's between old
money and new money.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:17.560 align:middle line:10%
And what you're seeing
is this reformatting

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.920 align:middle line:10%
of the global economy
away from speculative

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:10%
into something else.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.250 align:middle line:10%
The old money will
never lose their wealth,

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.667 align:middle line:10%
because their wealth is not
in zeros and ones on the stock

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:29.980 align:middle line:10%
market, and the new money--
the Rockefellers, et cetera--

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.180 align:middle line:10%
they have no access
to the old money.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.250 align:middle line:10%
They simply can't-- the same
way as we have no access

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.530 align:middle line:10%
to the inner sanctum of
the Bilderberg Group,

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.950 align:middle line:10%
the Trilateral Commission,
Council on Foreign Relations,

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.610 align:middle line:10%
we can't go to the elite schools
in Los Angeles, where the--

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:10%
the children of the Hollywood
megastars or the producers--

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:50.770 align:middle line:10%
we can't--

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.180 align:middle line:10%
they won't accept us, just as
the children of the Hollywood

00:38:55.180 --> 00:39:00.430 align:middle line:10%
megastars or Russian oligarchs
cannot go to the elite English

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.980 align:middle line:10%
schools, such as
Eton, for example.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not a question of money.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Russian oligarchs have
stolen billions of dollars

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.040 align:middle line:90%
over the past-- billions.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And as far as cash
is concerned, they're

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.220 align:middle line:84%
far wealthier than
the Rockefellers

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.620 align:middle line:84%
or the Rothschilds, but
they're the lowest of the low

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.233 align:middle line:84%
as far as these
people are concerned,

00:39:19.233 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:90%
because they've been around.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's, I said, the phantom
conversation between Putin

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and the Queen of England--
the same thing here.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So Mr. Harikowski, how long
have you been around for?

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:90%
30 years.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:90%
We've been around for 300.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.170 align:middle line:90%
And we've been around for 800.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't want your kind
dirtying up our school.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So the point is,
again, the same fight

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're seeing on
different levels of society,

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it is
between our children,

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:48.055 align:middle line:84%
the schools they can go
to, or the elite children.

00:39:48.055 --> 00:39:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
elite within the elite,

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.498 align:middle line:84%
the inner sanctum
of these schools,

00:39:52.498 --> 00:39:54.040 align:middle line:84%
because the people--
the children who

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:58.020 align:middle line:84%
go to these institutions--
do you guys see Harry Potter

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.057 align:middle line:90%
or read Harry Potter?

00:40:00.057 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow I'll be talking
about civilizatory canons

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.512 align:middle line:84%
in my presentation and
on trance evolution.

00:40:04.512 --> 00:40:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the funny thing-- when
you look at Harry Potter,

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.430 align:middle line:84%
you have the muggles
and the magles.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.970 align:middle line:84%
What language do they
use for their spells?

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Latin, right?

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.980 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason
why Latin is used.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.945 align:middle line:10%
I'll explain it tomorrow, but
the point is that the elite--

00:40:20.945 --> 00:40:23.320 align:middle line:10%
the kids of the elite-- they
don't go to school to become

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.980 align:middle line:10%
a manager at IBM or McDonald's.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.030 align:middle line:84%
They go to the elite schools to
manage and control the world,

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to rule the world, which is
a very different perception.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, you have the
money, the old money,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.020 align:middle line:84%
500 years more-- you
have the 300, 250,

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the younger
money, 150 to about 80,

00:40:43.850 --> 00:40:47.200 align:middle line:84%
and then the last little bit,
last cycle after World War II,

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:84%
the people who made their
money in stock markets,

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and the investments, oil
business, et cetera, et cetera.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's also very important
to understand, again,

00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:01.120 align:middle line:10%
that there is almost no way that
these levels can be breached.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:84%
The people who have run
the world for 1,000 years.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.250 align:middle line:84%
They are the same
people, the same family.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:07.360 align:middle line:90%
They intermarry.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are the elites--
the Dorias, the Farneses.

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:15.017 align:middle line:84%
And even, for example, you
look at who wrote James Bond?

00:41:15.017 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you this.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Ian Fleming.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:17.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Ian Fleming.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know
that Ian Fleming

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.380 align:middle line:84%
comes from one of the wealthiest
families in history of England?

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Their wealth goes
back about 600 years.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not, oh, a writer,
a successful author

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:middle line:84%
of James Bond, who made some
money by selling his books.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The Flemings are one of
the wealthiest family

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:90%
in the history of England.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They sold a few years back--
you could check it online--

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.010 align:middle line:84%
one of their businesses
for $3.2 billion.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:47.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't do that unless your
money goes way back when.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.900 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with Camerons,
the former prime minister

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:90%
of England.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.660 align:middle line:10%
This is the guy
that sold England.

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.950 align:middle line:10%
He miscalculated, and they were
forced out of Europe, and now

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:10%
with Brexit--

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.010 align:middle line:10%
the Camerons are part
of the Marlborough--

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:10%
and who are the Marlboroughs?

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:90%
That's Churchill.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.280 align:middle line:84%
These people go back
also 600, 700 years.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.382 align:middle line:90%
That's wealth.

00:42:08.382 --> 00:42:10.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to see
it, because they're not

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.370 align:middle line:84%
going to advertise it,
but people who know,

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:90%
they understand.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.120 align:middle line:84%
They have a different
language from the language

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.740 align:middle line:90%
that we speak.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a language of
signs and symbols, which

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.560 align:middle line:10%
is why elite private schools--
they all have uniforms, which

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.560 align:middle line:10%
is not-- which is why
you're not allowed to wear

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.440 align:middle line:10%
ripped jeans to
school, which is why

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:10%
everyone has a uniform
with a different color.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And these colors represent
clans in the same way--

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.610 align:middle line:84%
if you look in China,
the same thing.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese clans
are called dragons.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And for example, Xi Jinping,
the current premier,

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.080 align:middle line:90%
is not a communist leader.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.780 align:middle line:84%
He is a national
socialist leader.

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.090 align:middle line:90%
He's not even Chinese.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
He is a direct descendant
of Genghis Khan.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.260 align:middle line:90%


00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And he belongs to
the yellow dragons.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Who are the yellow dragons?

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:10%
These are the people who
fought and lost to England

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.570 align:middle line:10%
the Opium Wars in the
19th century, which

00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.300 align:middle line:10%
is why the Rothschilds--
again, go online.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Why did the Rothschilds brought
down to China 30,000 ounces--

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.780 align:middle line:90%
sorry, tons of gold--

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.342 align:middle line:90%
30,000.

00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Out of the goodness
of their heart?

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Because they want
to help China rise?

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they're communists
or proto communists?

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.420 align:middle line:84%
This is as a reparation
for their transgressions

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Opium Wars, the
first and second Opium Wars.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand what I mean?

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:42.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is how
things really work.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to understand,
it's very important

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that we forget linear
thinking, and we

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.890 align:middle line:90%
try to think conceptually.

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The war between the
Rockefellers and the Rothschilds

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:84%
is the war between those
who lost the first two world

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.100 align:middle line:84%
wars-- the Rockefellers beat
the Rothschilds in the First

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and the Second World Wars.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And then in 2012, I don't know
if you saw the Rockefellers--

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.260 align:middle line:10%
they handed their positions
because they got out

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:10%
of the oil business.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.877 align:middle line:90%
Did you see that?

00:44:11.877 --> 00:44:12.710 align:middle line:90%
You didn't see that?

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Go online and check it out.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.585 align:middle line:84%
The Rockefellers
announced that they're

00:44:15.585 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the oil
business in 2000-- why?

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Because they love environment?

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.350 align:middle line:90%
They love Great Thunberg?

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.870 align:middle line:10%
No, because they lost.

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:27.045 align:middle line:10%
These are two grandmasters
playing chess,

00:44:27.045 --> 00:44:28.670 align:middle line:10%
and in chess, if
you're a grand master,

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.563 align:middle line:10%
you don't wait until
you are checkmated.

00:44:31.563 --> 00:44:33.980 align:middle line:10%
You play to the point where
you know you're going to lose,

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.770 align:middle line:10%
and you hand in your positions.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.910 align:middle line:10%
And so what happened
was the Rockefellers--

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:41.540 align:middle line:10%
they handed over their
positions, and the oils--

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.000 align:middle line:10%
they got out of the oil
sector because they lost

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.343 align:middle line:10%
to the Rothschilds in 2012.

00:44:47.343 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:10%
And what you're
seeing right now--

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.310 align:middle line:10%
again, I said earlier
that, on a global level,

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.140 align:middle line:10%
the elite families--

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:56.700 align:middle line:10%
they don't kill each other,
or they don't-- top 20, 30,

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.810 align:middle line:10%
50 families--
they're untouchable.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Then when you get
out of the top 50,

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.550 align:middle line:84%
you get to the top
100 or top 300--

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:05.902 align:middle line:90%
for example, the Kennedys.

00:45:05.902 --> 00:45:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Kennedys were killed because
Kennedys-- they're not top 50,

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.420 align:middle line:90%
and they're not top 100.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.440 align:middle line:90%
They may be top 300 families.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So Kennedy was
punished, and they've

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:17.360 align:middle line:84%
been punished for
three generations.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it should
be patently obvious.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.308 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to go into
the lone assassin theory.

00:45:23.308 --> 00:45:24.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we need to.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:27.110 align:middle line:10%
I think people who come
to these types of forums

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:10%
understand more
than enough for us

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:37.760 align:middle line:10%
not to need to actually
graphically explain

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:38.870 align:middle line:10%
what had happened.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you another example.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.777 align:middle line:84%
For many, many
years, the family who

00:45:42.777 --> 00:45:44.360 align:middle line:84%
are the top family
in the round table.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.700 align:middle line:84%
The round table-- today's
round table in America

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.830 align:middle line:84%
is called Council on
Foreign Relations.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Round table comes
from Cecil Rhodes.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.040 align:middle line:84%
These are the people who founded
Rhodesia, today Zimbabwe.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Rhodesia, Rhodes--
today, Zimbabwe.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:01.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the direct
representation

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.530 align:middle line:90%
of the British empire.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.680 align:middle line:10%
The man who for many, many
years ran the round table

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.642 align:middle line:10%
was Baron Caccia.

00:46:08.642 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look
at his curriculum,

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.810 align:middle line:90%
you see he went to school.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:10%
He played cricket,
and he played rugby--

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.070 align:middle line:10%
typical boring stuff.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.800 align:middle line:10%
Went to the elite school,
became a diplomat.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:10%
But again, when you look at who
these people are historically,

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.120 align:middle line:10%
these are the-- some of
the oldest representatives

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.590 align:middle line:10%
of the Venetian black nobility.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.640 align:middle line:10%
And Venetian black
nobility-- we're talking

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.110 align:middle line:10%
about 12th, 13th century.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So wealth went from
Venice to England,

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.260 align:middle line:84%
from England to
the United States

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.260 align:middle line:84%
when they took over
the United States.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:46.370 align:middle line:10%
And now the energy is going
from the West to the East.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you see the new
Silk Road, the Eurasian union,

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:56.610 align:middle line:10%
because this energy is now
going from the West to the East.

00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:59.190 align:middle line:10%
But you can't understand that
unless you look at things

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.230 align:middle line:10%
conceptually, and Baron
Caccia-- again, we're

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.220 align:middle line:10%
looking at some of the
wealthiest, oldest families.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.160 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of the times, when you
look at a photograph of people,

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.175 align:middle line:10%
and you have in the
front row the guy who

00:47:10.175 --> 00:47:12.000 align:middle line:10%
was the president of
the United States,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.670 align:middle line:10%
and some other prime minister,
and in the second row,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.430 align:middle line:10%
you have some minister
of foreign affairs.

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:24.027 align:middle line:10%
And in the third row, a guy kind
of silly looking with glasses,

00:47:24.027 --> 00:47:25.485 align:middle line:10%
and his kind of
tie is all crooked,

00:47:25.485 --> 00:47:27.510 align:middle line:10%
and he's kind of looking over
the shoulders of everybody

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:28.310 align:middle line:10%
else--

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:10%
that's the guy who runs
everybody in that picture.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Again, I think it
should be obvious.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're in the front
row, you're a nobody.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:90%
The same goes on Google.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:40.577 align:middle line:10%
For example, you Google
some of these old families.

00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:41.535 align:middle line:90%
There's no information.

00:47:41.535 --> 00:47:43.327 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they're not important.

00:47:43.327 --> 00:47:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It means that they're
very important.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.950 align:middle line:84%
You Google my name, there's
like two million pages.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Am I important?

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.700 align:middle line:90%
I am a nobody.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.287 align:middle line:84%
You get somebody
like Jeff Bezos.

00:47:52.287 --> 00:47:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:53.970 align:middle line:90%
Like 50 million.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:54.770 align:middle line:90%
Is he important?

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.420 align:middle line:90%
He's a nobody.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Real money, real power has
absolutely no information

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:01.410 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.100 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
they don't exist.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:06.210 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist for the
world, but they exist.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.235 align:middle line:90%
And how do they exist?

00:48:07.235 --> 00:48:08.610 align:middle line:10%
And again, that's
very important.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:10%
You can find the information.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:13.330 align:middle line:84%
You just have to make sure
you look the right way.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And when you look
at the curricula

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:10%
and look at the schools
that they went to,

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.450 align:middle line:10%
look where they studied,
look at the societies

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:19.860 align:middle line:10%
that they belong to.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.570 align:middle line:10%
Everybody knows about
the Bilderbergs,

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:25.563 align:middle line:10%
again, thanks to my book,
which sold a lot of copies

00:48:25.563 --> 00:48:26.730 align:middle line:10%
in many different countries.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.160 align:middle line:10%
And one of the reasons
Bilderberg became so popular

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.170 align:middle line:10%
is people forever thought--

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.850 align:middle line:10%
they talked about the
Illuminati, and the Jews,

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:10%
and the Masons, and
the all seeing eye,

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:40.330 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't know how
all this stuff related.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And then in my book on
the Bilderbergs, suddenly

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I explain how they
work, who these-- they

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.630 align:middle line:84%
are with pictures,
and documents,

00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and secret information,
which never before came out.

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly
everybody thought, OK,

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:56.520 align:middle line:84%
so Bilderbergers run the
world, but the Bilderberg

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.770 align:middle line:84%
is just as the commission--
the Trilateral Commission,

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:00.270 align:middle line:84%
the Council on
Foreign Relations--

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.890 align:middle line:84%
they're part and parcel of
the liberal banking financier

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.437 align:middle line:90%
order, just as Davos is.

00:49:05.437 --> 00:49:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of other societies

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:84%
which you've never
even heard of--

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the [? Curunati, ?]
the Cincinnatis,

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:90%
the [? Punai ?] Circle.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.400 align:middle line:84%
There's just so much
stuff out there.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you see things like
that, don't skip over it.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Find out.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:90%
There is stuff on Google.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.560 align:middle line:84%
You just go and say,
who are these people?

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.778 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard of them.

00:49:26.778 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:84%
They belong to this society
that's never even heard of,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.160 align:middle line:90%
but they exist.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.788 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:49:31.788 --> 00:49:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And then suddenly
you start realizing

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that, when you start
drawing this kind of stuff--

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.920 align:middle line:84%
conception in the
piece of paper.

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly all these things
start making a lot more sense.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Just as I said before, it's
not a pyramidal structure,

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.900 align:middle line:90%
because that would be too easy.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The president-- I cut his
head off or I kill him,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and then the other structure is
headless, which means mindless,

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.810 align:middle line:90%
which means there's no control.

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:54.780 align:middle line:10%
There's no dynamic
for the future, which

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.310 align:middle line:10%
is why it's not a pyramid.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.535 align:middle line:10%
These are concentric circles.

00:49:58.535 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:10%
When you start looking at
these concentric circles,

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.870 align:middle line:10%
again you start realizing
that the real power is

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:06.540 align:middle line:10%
a very different thing
from the kind of stuff

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:11.050 align:middle line:10%
that we are used to seeing.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:15.930 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about the global system,

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.580 align:middle line:84%
again, now let's
think of a pyramid.

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.900 align:middle line:90%
So a pyramid has three parts.

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.550 align:middle line:84%
The top part would
be the slave owner.

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.050 align:middle line:84%
The middle part
would be the guy who

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:24.510 align:middle line:84%
is actually running the
slaves, and the third part

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:25.720 align:middle line:90%
with the slaves.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
education or knowledge,

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.238 align:middle line:84%
it would be the same
triangle, but inversed.

00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:32.280 align:middle line:10%
So the bottom, which is
the biggest base-- that's

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.197 align:middle line:10%
going to have the biggest
amount of knowledge,

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:37.560 align:middle line:10%
conceptual knowledge, historical
knowledge, full knowledge

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:38.640 align:middle line:10%
of history.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.182 align:middle line:10%
That's going to be
for the people who

00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:41.130 align:middle line:10%
are the slave owners.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:46.390 align:middle line:10%
And then as you go down,
the apex of our triangle--

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.755 align:middle line:10%
that's what we know--
we, the people.

00:50:48.755 --> 00:50:50.130 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
things -- about --

00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:53.280 align:middle line:10%
to make sure the education
system is as bad as it is is

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:55.210 align:middle line:10%
you have to fragment
information,

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:56.710 align:middle line:10%
because the problem
of the dilemma--

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.110 align:middle line:10%
it's a catch-22.

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.313 align:middle line:10%
I'm a slave owner.

00:51:00.313 --> 00:51:02.730 align:middle line:10%
I want you to do a good job,
but for you to do a good job,

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.092 align:middle line:10%
you have to know stuff.

00:51:04.092 --> 00:51:05.550 align:middle line:10%
But if you know
stuff, you're going

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.342 align:middle line:10%
to rebel against me,
because someday you're

00:51:07.342 --> 00:51:09.987 align:middle line:10%
going to start asking questions
which I don't want you to ask.

00:51:09.987 --> 00:51:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And if you get together
with other countries

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.790 align:middle line:10%
with other people in other
regions, be it via internet

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:17.470 align:middle line:10%
or I don't care how, then
suddenly I have a problem,

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.180 align:middle line:10%
because I don't have an army.

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.680 align:middle line:10%
And there are not many of us--
again, think of Harry Potter.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.393 align:middle line:10%
You have the muggles
and the magles.

00:51:24.393 --> 00:51:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The trick is how the
people who run the school

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.183 align:middle line:90%
can control a much bigger body--

00:51:28.183 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that if all these
students got together,

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.360 align:middle line:84%
they can overpower them, because
there are not many of them.

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:34.500 align:middle line:90%
So this power is elusive.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to make sure that
they can never figure it out.

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.127 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:51:39.127 --> 00:51:40.460 align:middle line:90%
We fragment all the information.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.148 align:middle line:10%
It's like kaleidoscopic
information.

00:51:43.148 --> 00:51:44.190 align:middle line:10%
We don't give you enough.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.310 align:middle line:10%
We give you a little
bit of everything.

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.810 align:middle line:84%
There's just so much stuff out
there, but is that knowledge?

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole bunch of stuff.

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:54.947 align:middle line:84%
You can play Trivial Pursuit
and be very good at it,

00:51:54.947 --> 00:51:56.530 align:middle line:84%
but does that mean
you know something?

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.250 align:middle line:90%
You know nothing.

00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't think.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
All you do is just
memorize a bunch of numbers

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.910 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of names of
some stupid Hollywood stars

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and whoever else out there, and
you answer the stupid question.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:08.840 align:middle line:90%
Does that make you wise?

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Does that make you
think conceptually?

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.620 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you see things?

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So why, again, it's very, very
important to understand that,

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because of the way it's all
structured, for the elite,

00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:22.120 align:middle line:84%
it's very important that they
fragment the information.

00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:10%
And for them to be able to
fragment the information,

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.378 align:middle line:10%
they have to make sure that
they control what they show you.

00:52:27.378 --> 00:52:29.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
social media comes in.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:33.130 align:middle line:84%
That's where television-- that's
where cultural shocks come in.

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:34.600 align:middle line:84%
What's the cheapest
way to control

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.810 align:middle line:84%
people's understanding of
reality and the World Affairs?

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:38.975 align:middle line:90%
Netflix.

00:52:38.975 --> 00:52:39.867 align:middle line:90%
You pay $12--

00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what--
what does it cost?

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a TV.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.080 align:middle line:90%
What does it cost in America?

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> $14.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it's like I
can't think of a cheaper way

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to brainwash you.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.020 align:middle line:84%
You pay $14, but you pay me
money so I brainwash you.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:54.668 align:middle line:90%
And you get a million channels.

00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:55.960 align:middle line:90%
And you see all kinds of stuff.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.460 align:middle line:84%
You see football, and you see
baseball, and you see history,

00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.830 align:middle line:90%
and you see all kinds of stuff.

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And most of it is
very well done,

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.630 align:middle line:84%
except for the key
elements of the information

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is not there, which
is how they brush--

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:08.500 align:middle line:90%
brainwash you.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.667 align:middle line:84%
That's how they control the
information you actually

00:53:10.667 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:90%
receive.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you let me give me an
example of how that would work.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.910 align:middle line:84%
This is called
shapeless control.

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the Soviet Union
fell apart back in 1991,

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we had the biggest armed
forces in the world, the most

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.770 align:middle line:84%
powerful military,
and we collapsed

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:28.510 align:middle line:90%
without a shot being fired.

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:30.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could never
destroy a country like Russia

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:90%
militarily.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It's too big, too strong,
too powerful, too many

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:35.370 align:middle line:90%
nuclear weapons.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.030 align:middle line:84%
It would wipe the entire
world over many times over.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.830 align:middle line:90%
But they did.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.250 align:middle line:10%
How did they do it?

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:41.757 align:middle line:10%
They did it conceptually.

00:53:41.757 --> 00:53:43.840 align:middle line:10%
So what happened when the
Soviet Union fell apart.

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.257 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the things that
happened-- the interest rates

00:53:46.257 --> 00:53:49.240 align:middle line:10%
went up to 200%, 250%.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.400 align:middle line:10%
So imagine this.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.380 align:middle line:10%
You have a factory, whether
it's nuclear technology,

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:56.975 align:middle line:10%
whether it's machine, because,
again, technologically

00:53:56.975 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:10%
speaking, we're the
number one nation--

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.870 align:middle line:10%
were-- the Soviet Union,
number one nation in the world.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:04.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you're the factory
owner, and you need money--

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and you do, because you
have to make it run.

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.700 align:middle line:10%
You're going to go to the
bank, and then they'll

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.788 align:middle line:10%
give you interest at
250% interest loan.

00:54:11.788 --> 00:54:13.330 align:middle line:10%
So you're going to
say, OK, I'm going

00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.440 align:middle line:10%
to have to build something,
and I have this 250% interest

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:17.865 align:middle line:10%
rate for one year.

00:54:17.865 --> 00:54:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So in one year,
I'm going to have

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to build something from
nothing, make it work,

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.360 align:middle line:84%
sell it, and give
the money back.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:23.240 align:middle line:10%
Can I do it?

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely not.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.050 align:middle line:10%
So what am I going to do?

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:29.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to take that money
to Turkey, buy leather coats,

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.780 align:middle line:10%
bring it back to Russia,
and sell it on the market

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:36.047 align:middle line:10%
at a 300% premium, which
is what is being done.

00:54:36.047 --> 00:54:36.880 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.680 align:middle line:10%
It means that the
factories, the technology

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:43.420 align:middle line:10%
collapsed in about three
years between 1991 and 1994.

00:54:43.420 --> 00:54:44.350 align:middle line:10%
It collapsed.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.390 align:middle line:10%
We had no technology left.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.510 align:middle line:10%
We went from being the
most technologically

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.910 align:middle line:10%
advanced country in the world--

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:53.630 align:middle line:10%
we were the first in space.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:10%
Remember that-- to
having nothing at all.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.437 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

00:54:59.437 --> 00:55:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And how was it being done?

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Because somebody invaded
the Soviet Union?

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.020 align:middle line:10%
No, you can't invade
a country like that.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:90%
You destroy it differently.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.756 align:middle line:90%
It's a shapeless control.

00:55:08.756 --> 00:55:10.105 align:middle line:90%
I can give you another example.

00:55:10.105 --> 00:55:13.560 align:middle line:90%


00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Back in 1997, Yeltsin, at
the time, was the president.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:23.370 align:middle line:84%
He put this young reformer
by the name of Kiriyenko

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.050 align:middle line:90%
as the prime minister.

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:84%
He put forth a series of very
risky and, as it turned out,

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.440 align:middle line:84%
very negative reforms
for the Russian economy,

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.205 align:middle line:90%
and the economy collapsed.

00:55:36.205 --> 00:55:37.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, Kiriyenko,
instead of being fired

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.180 align:middle line:10%
or being shot in the back
of his head, what he did--

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:10%
he was given a cushy job by
Council of Foreign Relations,

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.820 align:middle line:10%
and now he lives very
well in Australia.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.750 align:middle line:10%
Understand how it works?

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:51.420 align:middle line:10%
You do it through proxies.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:53.220 align:middle line:10%
It's a shapeless
control of society,

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:59.130 align:middle line:10%
and I talk about it in my book
on the Tavistock Institute.

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So when we are
talking about control,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.020 align:middle line:84%
let me show it to
you-- how it works--

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:05.370 align:middle line:90%
with my hand.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:07.750 align:middle line:84%
We are accustomed to having
the executive branch.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:10.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the president, or the
prime minister in cabinet.

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:15.360 align:middle line:84%
The legislative-- that's
the Congress, the Senate.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the judiciary,
the supreme Court.

00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:90%
But I have five fingers--

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I have two of these
fingers, which

00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.770 align:middle line:90%
we think are not important.

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually they're
very, very important.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.887 align:middle line:90%
This is the conceptual finger.

00:56:26.887 --> 00:56:27.720 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:28.950 align:middle line:90%
Imagine this.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I come in and I say to you,
hey, let's work together.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's make this thing work,
everybody working together

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:39.000 align:middle line:84%
for the betterment of society,
for the concept of common good.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's make sure that
everybody is doing well,

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.212 align:middle line:84%
that nobody is poor,
and nobody is sick,

00:56:43.212 --> 00:56:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and nobody is living
in the street.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:45.878 align:middle line:90%
That's a good example, right?

00:56:45.878 --> 00:56:46.810 align:middle line:90%
That's a good idea.

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Everybody says, yeah, wonderful.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.002 align:middle line:84%
What if I am this guy who
says, hey, what I really

00:56:51.002 --> 00:56:53.460 align:middle line:84%
want to do is enslave all of
you, take everything you have,

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.410 align:middle line:84%
kill all of you, and
control your land,

00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:56.952 align:middle line:84%
and your territories,
and your money,

00:56:56.952 --> 00:56:58.590 align:middle line:90%
and for it to become mine.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.105 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I said that, people
are probably going to say

00:57:01.105 --> 00:57:03.480 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to give it to
you without a fight, right?

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:04.570 align:middle line:10%
So what do I need?

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I need Santa Claus,
which is what?

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Packaging.

00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I need to package this.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.815 align:middle line:90%
And a package is conceptual.

00:57:10.815 --> 00:57:15.270 align:middle line:84%
They say, people,
morons, let's do this.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.730 align:middle line:84%
We have all these countries
out there who like democracy.

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Let's invade Russia.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Let's invade Bolivia.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's invade Venezuela.

00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:10%
We have the dictator there--

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:28.330 align:middle line:10%
and use the media to
present the dialectic.

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:30.180 align:middle line:10%
So this is the
conceptual finger,

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.860 align:middle line:10%
but then I have another finger.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.170 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
ideological finger.

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever seen statues
of Lenin, and Stalin,

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.200 align:middle line:10%
and Mao Zedong?

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.367 align:middle line:84%
They're always standing
there with a finger pointing

00:57:39.367 --> 00:57:40.890 align:middle line:90%
somewhere, right?

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.850 align:middle line:90%
This is the ideology.

00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:43.950 align:middle line:90%
We are going there.

00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:46.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the road map.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I design from
a conceptual point

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:52.710 align:middle line:84%
of view an ideology of
a party, and it's not

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:54.060 align:middle line:90%
a Republican or Democratic.

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.075 align:middle line:84%
It's one party
separated by abortion,

00:57:57.075 --> 00:57:59.700 align:middle line:84%
which is what I said in the very
beginning of the presentation.

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.218 align:middle line:10%
The fight is not between the
Republicans and the Democrats,

00:58:02.218 --> 00:58:04.260 align:middle line:10%
between conservatives and
the liberals in Canada,

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:08.280 align:middle line:10%
between the socialists and
the conservatives in England,

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.390 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.990 align:middle line:10%
It's between global, financial,
parasitical liberal order

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:17.590 align:middle line:10%
on the one hand and
the industrial society.

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you control this,
and you can control that,

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.880 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really matter
who runs the country.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.370 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't really
matter who, and what,

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:10%
and how it's being legislated.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:33.030 align:middle line:10%
And it makes no difference
how the judiciary works,

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.900 align:middle line:10%
because when you think of power,
we think of national policy.

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.405 align:middle line:10%
And we'll think
of foreign policy,

00:58:38.405 --> 00:58:39.780 align:middle line:10%
but what you have
to understand--

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.800 align:middle line:10%
there is another policy
called global policy.

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.510 align:middle line:10%
Now, that global policy is not
run by presidents of countries.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:48.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not run by
senates, not overseen

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.090 align:middle line:10%
by checks and
balances, committees.

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.990 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't exist.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:55.650 align:middle line:10%
It's not even run
by these elite think

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:58.710 align:middle line:10%
tanks, or the Bilderbergers,
or the Davos forum.

00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:01.830 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter, whatever
you want to call them.

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.510 align:middle line:84%
They're run by what's
called global projects,

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is what I want
to talk about right now.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.300 align:middle line:90%


00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:12.373 align:middle line:84%
We are at the stage right now
what you can call global 3.0.

00:59:12.373 --> 00:59:14.040 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine,
Catherine Austin Fitts

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.830 align:middle line:84%
former undersecretary for
housing with Bush father--

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.040 align:middle line:84%
she has a wonderful
website called Solari.com.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I very strongly
suggest you visit it.

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.590 align:middle line:84%
She talked about this
term, global 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.

00:59:29.590 --> 00:59:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, global 1.0 is the
period between Westphalia,

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:36.630 align:middle line:84%
which is 1648 until
about the late 1960s,

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:37.590 align:middle line:90%
or the 20th century.

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:40.710 align:middle line:10%
That's nation-state republics,
constitutions, borders,

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:41.940 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Then in 1968, the
Bilderbergers, actually,

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:middle line:10%
at the meeting in
Mont-Tremblant--

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:49.080 align:middle line:10%
it's a little town on the
outskirts of Montreal.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.200 align:middle line:10%
They came up with a context--

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.480 align:middle line:10%
with the idea called one
world company limited.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:10%
That's global 2.0--
corporations that

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.910 align:middle line:10%
have more power than any
government on the planet.

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:02.490 align:middle line:10%
We can talk about Goldman
Sachs, et cetera, et cetera.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:06.420 align:middle line:10%
And now we are the
period of global 3.0,

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:09.670 align:middle line:10%
world of networking
post-industrial world.

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:10.570 align:middle line:90%
So what does it mean.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It means that the
concept of nation state,

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the concept of a nation
itself as a country

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:19.960 align:middle line:90%
is no longer valid.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.900 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing-- one of
the consequences of the global

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:26.080 align:middle line:10%
economic collapse that
we're witnessing right now--

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
it may happen in
the next two months.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:31.960 align:middle line:10%
It may happen by the time the
2020 elections come around.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.180 align:middle line:10%
It may happen in
2020, but it's now.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
It's right around the corner--

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:38.110 align:middle line:10%
like literally
around the corner.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:41.680 align:middle line:10%
We're going to live to see it
in a very short period of time.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.663 align:middle line:10%
So the concept of a
country is now dead,

01:00:44.663 --> 01:00:47.080 align:middle line:10%
which means that you need to
come up with another concept,

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and that concept
is regionalization

01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:53.200 align:middle line:10%
of global economies, where not
countries but economic regions

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.570 align:middle line:10%
are going to try to work
together to survive.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.880 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, BRICS,
for example, which

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.880 align:middle line:10%
was Brazil, Russia,
India, China, South

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Africa, was the first attempt
to regionalize a global economy.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:07.630 align:middle line:10%
For a global economy
to work, a region

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:11.720 align:middle line:10%
has to be between 300
and 500 million people.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:16.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at what a 300 to
500 million people region would

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.787 align:middle line:84%
look like, for example, it would
be the United States, Canada,

01:01:18.787 --> 01:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
parts of Mexico,
Australia, and New Zealand.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%
It'll be like a dollar region.

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the rest of Latin America
would be the peso region,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:25.900 align:middle line:90%
for example.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.790 align:middle line:90%
There would be a European axis--

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Paris, Berlin with
former French colonies

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.793 align:middle line:84%
in Africa as the
natural resources base.

01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:37.335 align:middle line:84%
That will be another
region, and that

01:01:37.335 --> 01:01:38.750 align:middle line:84%
will be whatever they're
going to call it.

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.417 align:middle line:84%
China is going to be
a separate region--

01:01:40.417 --> 01:01:41.240 align:middle line:90%
India.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Russia is going to
be divided literally

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:46.990 align:middle line:84%
in half geographically
by the Ural Mountains,

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
where the western
Russia is going

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
to join Syria, the Balkan
countries, Iran, Turkey,

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
former Turkic Soviet
speaking republics.

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
The eastern part is going to
join the Koreas and Japan,

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and then we're
left with England,

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.830 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the main
reasons for Brexit--

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is because they
understood very well

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:07.660 align:middle line:90%
that it was a global collapse.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
They have no future in
Europe, because Europe

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.647 align:middle line:90%
has no future as a unit.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So they need to come up
with an alternative, which

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:17.440 align:middle line:90%
is why leaving Europe--

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.320 align:middle line:84%
they need a market,
and that market

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.743 align:middle line:90%
was going to be the Arab world.

01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And what you're seeing
right now is an attempt

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
to redefine the global
regionalization of economies.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing it
not only in England.

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing it also
in Latin America.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:36.545 align:middle line:90%
You see it in Europe.

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this strife
that you're seeing globally

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the need to
redefine-- not only come up

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
with a new language
to define what's

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:47.950 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to us,
because you need a road map.

01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I said yesterday in
the panel history is--

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
answers the
question, who are we?

01:02:54.220 --> 01:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And meta history
answers the question,

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.480 align:middle line:90%
what will become of us?

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And to be able to
answer the question what

01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
will become of us, we need a
road map to define that future.

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And that road map can only
be reached conceptually,

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:08.530 align:middle line:84%
not on a level of
president, not on a level

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
of the house or the senate,
not on the level of the Supreme

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
Court--

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.300 align:middle line:90%
only conception.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And once we have the conceptual
understanding of reality,

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:20.620 align:middle line:84%
then we can create an
ideology to define it.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the reasons
why they're on Yalta two,

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:24.438 align:middle line:90%
Bretton Woods two.

01:03:24.438 --> 01:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Call it whatever
you want to call it.

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not really an
appropriate name,

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
because again, Yalta
was nations defining

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
the future of the world based on
the winners and losers of World

01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
War II.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Here there are no countries.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just a model,
an economic model

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that's on its deathbed
which needs to be refined.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.910 align:middle line:10%
And again, what's going
to happen, whether you're

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:48.400 align:middle line:10%
talking about old money
fighting young money,

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.553 align:middle line:10%
whether you're talking
about governments fighting

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:51.970 align:middle line:10%
other governments,
or corporations

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:54.550 align:middle line:10%
at war with each
other, what you're

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:58.450 align:middle line:10%
going to have is redistribution
of this resource, which

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.030 align:middle line:10%
is a financial resource.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:04.270 align:middle line:10%
So it means that, again,
we've gone from concept

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:07.000 align:middle line:10%
of nation-state,
concept to one world

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.870 align:middle line:10%
company limited, post-industrial
world, world of networking,

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:middle line:10%
and now we are going
to regionalization

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.220 align:middle line:10%
of the global economies.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And the next step after
that, which is, again,

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
right around the
corner, is the idea

01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:21.130 align:middle line:84%
of city-states, as we've
had in the Middle Ages,

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and as we have today.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.800 align:middle line:90%
Vatican is a city-state.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Singapore is a city-state.

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.080 align:middle line:90%
Venice is a city-state.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Monaco is a city-state.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.830 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea of--

01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:32.830 align:middle line:10%
and again, I'll talk about
it more in-depth from

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:35.320 align:middle line:10%
the technological point of view,
what that means for the world

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.820 align:middle line:10%
in the future-- for example,
by the end of the 21st century,

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:40.710 align:middle line:10%
the biggest city in the world is
going to be Lagos in Nigeria--

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.550 align:middle line:10%
75 million people,
because 70% of the growth

01:04:45.550 --> 01:04:47.410 align:middle line:10%
is in the developing world.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:49.540 align:middle line:10%
And most of it is in
Africa, and Middle East,

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.590 align:middle line:10%
and Southeast Asia.

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:55.600 align:middle line:10%
So these mega cities are going
to redefine the relationship

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.047 align:middle line:10%
between people, between people
and robots, between people

01:04:58.047 --> 01:04:59.505 align:middle line:10%
and whatever it is
that we're going

01:04:59.505 --> 01:05:03.490 align:middle line:10%
to have with the surge of
technological advancement

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and artificial intelligence.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, my point in this
is that behind all

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.890 align:middle line:84%
these tectonic
transformational changes

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
are not countries, are not
people, are not Trumps,

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:21.330 align:middle line:84%
or Queen of England,
but global projects.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:25.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, a global project is
defined by three elements-- one,

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.480 align:middle line:10%
conceptual understanding
of the world--

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.280 align:middle line:10%
one.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Two-- having a global
economic independent model.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:38.993 align:middle line:10%
And three-- global independent
intelligence apparatus.

01:05:38.993 --> 01:05:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And you kind of
look at the world.

01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, is Germany
in a global project?

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.400 align:middle line:10%
No, they're not.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an occupied country
with over 50 bases--

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
American and other
European nations.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.160 align:middle line:10%
There's over 50
bases in Germany.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:58.140 align:middle line:10%
Any independent-- do you have
any foreign bases in America?

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.140 align:middle line:10%
You're not a free country,
because you control

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:04.500 align:middle line:10%
via the financial
cartel, but you certainly

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.940 align:middle line:10%
don't have any foreign bases.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Russia doesn't know
any foreign bases.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
China doesn't have
any foreign bases.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So Germany doesn't have, in
that sense, the independence.

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The same could be
said for Japan.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you're
looking at projects,

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.150 align:middle line:90%
who are these projects?

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one project
will be new Babylon.

01:06:22.890 --> 01:06:25.230 align:middle line:10%
We can call it that, or
you can say New York.

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a liberal
banking, financier,

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Wall Street centred project.

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And it's a global project.

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:31.870 align:middle line:90%
That's one project.

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.660 align:middle line:10%
Another project
is new Jerusalem.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.730 align:middle line:10%
That's London.

01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
And behind the new
Babylon project,

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.380 align:middle line:90%
you have the banking cartels.

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.750 align:middle line:90%
You have the Rockefellers.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
You have the intelligence
apparatus-- all the people

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
who are against Trump.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
London is you have the
Rothschilds, for example,

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:54.610 align:middle line:90%
and the Queen of England.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:58.110 align:middle line:10%
That's the new
Jerusalem project.

01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.160 align:middle line:10%
Then another project
is great Europe.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the old landed
European aristocracy.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:06.510 align:middle line:10%
Again, we're going
back 1,000 years.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:09.030 align:middle line:10%
This is what's called
black international.

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:11.610 align:middle line:10%
This is what's called
blood and soil.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.920 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever heard
that, blood and soil?

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.128 align:middle line:90%
Blood and soil.

01:07:15.128 --> 01:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, what are the colors?

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.510 align:middle line:10%
Again, because when you're
looking at the occult--

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:21.750 align:middle line:90%


01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.700 align:middle line:10%
please understand,
when I say the occult,

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.910 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean some wacky
conspiracy theory.

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:31.710 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric element-- colors
play a big role in this.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, black-- blood and
soil is blood is red,

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.170 align:middle line:10%
soil is black, right?

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:39.810 align:middle line:10%
So if you look at
some of the structures

01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.480 align:middle line:10%
out there in the
past, what structures,

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.430 align:middle line:10%
organizations have blood--

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:47.270 align:middle line:10%
or black and red
in their colors?

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Nazis.

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The Nazis, excellent.

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%
That's one.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
And also the Jesuits, right?

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:56.160 align:middle line:10%
Black and red, blood and soil.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking
at black international,

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
this is the European
landed aristocracy.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.180 align:middle line:10%
This is the old--
really old money.

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:05.470 align:middle line:84%
These people go
back 1,000 years.

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have a round table, and
we have the Russians with Putin.

01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
You have Xi Jinping, who are
representing yellow dragons.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
You have Modi, who is, again,
one of the older clans,

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.340 align:middle line:90%
going back about 1,000 years.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the chair
that says the United States.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Who sits there?

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Trump is not a representative
of the United States,

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
not because he is--
doesn't control

01:08:26.130 --> 01:08:27.540 align:middle line:90%
America, which is very true.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't control America.

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.430 align:middle line:90%
You have the media apparatus.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.899 align:middle line:84%
You have the
intelligence agencies.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You have the
Washington bureaucracy.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:35.345 align:middle line:90%
You have Wall Street.

01:08:35.345 --> 01:08:36.492 align:middle line:90%
You have Silicon Valley.

01:08:36.492 --> 01:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
All these people
are against Trump,

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:41.939 align:middle line:84%
and he can't control them,
which means he's not in control.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:46.439 align:middle line:84%
Trump is the face of
black international.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It is very important
to understand,

01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:53.410 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the things that
he does, Trump is not a person.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:57.517 align:middle line:84%
He is a project of one
part of the global elite.

01:08:57.517 --> 01:08:59.100 align:middle line:84%
When I say he's not
a project, I don't

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.330 align:middle line:84%
mean he's a shapeshifter
from outer space.

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:02.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he is.

01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:08.069 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, but conceptually
he is not a person.

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:15.000 align:middle line:10%
He is a project, and he became
a project when, in 2016,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:19.970 align:middle line:10%
as a result of the collapse of
the global financial order--

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:23.399 align:middle line:10%
or the Lehman Brothers a
few years earlier in 2008--

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:28.590 align:middle line:10%
the people who lost World
War I and World War II--

01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:31.500 align:middle line:10%
let's call them the Rothschilds,
but it's not the Rothschilds.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.319 align:middle line:84%
Behind the Rothschilds,
you have other powers.

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They suddenly realized that,
for the first time in about

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:42.870 align:middle line:84%
100 years, they had a chance to
push their candidate through,

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and that candidate
was Donald Trump.

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The point I'm trying to
make is that the people who

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:52.470 align:middle line:84%
pushed Trump's presidency
or his candidacy,

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.195 align:middle line:84%
pushed him as a consequence
of over 100 years

01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
push their candidate,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
because they lost World War
I. They lost World War II.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And after World War II, the
liberal banking financiers

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
controlled the entire Western
capitalist world economic model

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and all the money.

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:12.020 align:middle line:84%
So they had to sit very
quietly and wait their turn,

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and their turn came after
the collapse in 2008.

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's very
important to understand

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that it's not between the
Republicans and the Democrats.

01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It's the liberal banking global
financial order on its deathbed

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and the alternative
economic model

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.100 align:middle line:84%
run by the isolationists
or the industrialists.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And Trump is their
representative

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of this black international
blood and soil.

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Another group is Eurasia
with capital in Moscow.

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.080 align:middle line:90%
That's not Putin.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.760 align:middle line:90%
That's Eurasia.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the third
Genghis Khan horde.

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So the first empire was
the Genghis Khan empire.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The second Genghis
Khan empire was

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the union between the
Chinese and the Soviet Union

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:59.540 align:middle line:84%
between 1950 and 1953 between
Stalin and Mao Zedong,

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
which was a carbon copy of
the first Genghis Khan empire.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Right now what we're seeing
with the Eurasian integration--

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
it's an attempt to recreate
the third horde, the recreation

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Genghis Khan empire.

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Another project is
China, the great union

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.050 align:middle line:90%
called [? Datong ?] in China.

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:20.900 align:middle line:90%
These are the yellow dragons.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And the final project,
before 2012, 2014,

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
it was the black caliphate,
the ISIS, the [? diers, ?]

01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
the terrorists,
the Saudi Arabia.

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
They were working with
England in the sense

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that England needed a market,
and they were going to use--

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:42.030 align:middle line:84%
again, when I said London,
I said new Jerusalem.

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:45.380 align:middle line:84%
They were going to use
ISIS terrorists to clear

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.200 align:middle line:84%
that entire area
of the Asian world

01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, except
that they lost, right?

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And they were no longer a
part of this global project.

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And now we have a
new global project.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
It's called red Sufi
[? Tariqati ?] project out

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:03.310 align:middle line:90%
of turkey.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:05.607 align:middle line:84%
And so these are the
six global projects.

01:12:05.607 --> 01:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
looking at right now

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
globally-- it's not
countries at war.

01:12:10.010 --> 01:12:11.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not people.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:13.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the billionaires
or the millionaires.

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.265 align:middle line:84%
It's the people who have
been running all the--

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the projects-- who have been
running this structure globally

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:23.230 align:middle line:90%
for about 1,000 years.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And whether as countries
can agree to disagree,

01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
diplomatically reach
some kind of detente,

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:37.310 align:middle line:84%
global projects can't,
because globally,

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
from a conceptual point of
view, their version of history

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
absolutely is at war with all
the other global projects.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're seeing right now,

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's very important to
understand that everything

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that you see happening, whether
it's in the United States,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
whether it's in Europe--

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand these are
the-- these tectonic movements

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.105 align:middle line:84%
that are taking place
on the world stage.

01:13:00.105 --> 01:13:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, just to
summarize everything

01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I've said in one very short
sentence, think conceptually.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Don't take the information
that you're given as is.

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Try to understand
and how it fits

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.640 align:middle line:84%
into a bigger picture
from a point of view

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.815 align:middle line:84%
that has nothing to
do with the dialectic

01:13:15.815 --> 01:13:17.990 align:middle line:84%
you're being fed by
the mainstream media.

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:19.190 --> 01:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:31.000 align:middle line:90%
