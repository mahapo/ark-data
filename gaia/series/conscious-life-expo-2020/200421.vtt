00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for choosing this--
like the airlines, you know.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:90%
I know you have many choices.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for choosing
Mabel Katz, Ho'Oponopono.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.430 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you know
about Ho'Oponopono?

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
This will be a
different presentation.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.770 align:middle line:10%
I have two children's books.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And for me, being able to raise
happy kids is very important.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.600 align:middle line:84%
But today we are going to try to
raise a happy kid inside of us.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be basing
a lot in this book,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%
and I will be telling you about.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
They are both based
on Ho'Oponopono.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:90%
But this kind of became this.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of the same
thing, but in stories.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So my children's books are
for young children and adult

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:90%
children too.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:84%
Because it's about
remembering who we really are.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to be
hopefully it will work.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
This is my first
time handling a Mac.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:90%
You Mac people.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So today is not the
day after yesterday.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:90%
It is the day before tomorrow.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:10%
You know that every moment is
a new start, a your beginning.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.990 align:middle line:10%
You know, every decision, we are
taking decisions all the time.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:10%
And in every moment you
are creating your life.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:90%
You are creating your destiny.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
You actually can
change your destiny.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
How many of you think,
oh, this is my luck?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the way it is.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.340 align:middle line:90%
But really, it all depends.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
destiny, because you decided

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to let go instead of reacting.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.880 align:middle line:90%
So it's moment by moment.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But most of the time, the
choices that we are making

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:90%
are at the subconscious level.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't even know
we are choosing.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:90%
We don't do it consciously.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's so, so
important to become children

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
again, to be able to see
life like children see,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:90%
no differences or anything.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back to
thinking like children again.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Worry less, know that
we have everything.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Yesterday we had a panel
in the Spanish section.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And somebody asked
about anxiety.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
lack of trust.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:90%
We need to trust.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And we all go
through the anxiety,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
or we go a lot of to the past,
depression, and all that stuff,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:90%
because we don't want to let go.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to talk a
little bit about forgiveness

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:84%
too, because that is
also living in the past.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.070 align:middle line:84%
So our job is to be present,
to be more conscious,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
to make better
decisions, because that's

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.210 align:middle line:90%
when our life changes.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And really it is about that.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:10%
So parachutes work
only when you are open.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So are you willing
to open your mind?

It's an hour and
a half this, yes?

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, OK.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.348 align:middle line:84%
So are you willing
for the following 90

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
minutes, are you willing
to open your mind?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to tell
you very weird stuff.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.390 align:middle line:90%
Are you willing?

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell the
person next to you,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to open my
mind for 90 minutes.

>> So I will tell you
these weird stories,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's what
changed my life.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.300 align:middle line:84%
This is what really,
really changed my life.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why the
easiest way to grow.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I put all the pictures that
now I'm going to show you,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.530 align:middle line:90%
they are all stories.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
We are stories that I heard
from my teacher, Dr. Ihaleakala,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.740 align:middle line:90%
or even from my own students.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I still hear weird stories
from my young students.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know, but I used

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:84%
to be an accountant, a
tax senior accountant.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still very intellectual.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not like--

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
but because I started
believing in these weird things

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
is that my life changed.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.290 align:middle line:84%
So the first time that Dr.
Ihaleakala, my teacher,

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.640 align:middle line:84%
came to Los Angeles to
teach and stayed at my home,

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
he told me that my
washing machine asked him,

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:90%
are you the Ho'Oponopono guy.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:10%
I prepared you.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.390 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I told you.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:10%
So can you imagine
that a washing machine

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:10%
knew that the Ho'Oponopono
guy was coming?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:10%
And we think we are superior
to a washing machine,

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:10%
or that we know.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And right now, after all these
years, I have so many things

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to tell, in my
spiritual journeys,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:90%
when we go with people.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We just came back
from Avalon, and it's

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.880 align:middle line:90%
been an amazing experience.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And for me to start believing
in the magic, but really

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
the world is magic.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
connect with that.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very important,
especially in the times

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.180 align:middle line:84%
that we are living, where all
these changes are happening.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:10%
And we need to start
going with the flow,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:10%
instead of going against the
flow, staying in the box,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:10%
because things are
like this, and this

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:10%
is the way they have to work.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So another story that Dr.
Ihaleakala told me that once he

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:90%
slept in a library at a house.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't sleep
the whole night,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:84%
because the authors were
discussing the books,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:90%
and ideas and things.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine
something like that?

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, this represents
different things.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Morrnah, Morrnah
Simeona was the one

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that updated the Ho'Oponopono
for the modern times.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:90%
She was a healer.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.550 align:middle line:90%
She spoke to plants.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.742 align:middle line:84%
So if she had somebody
with a problem,

00:05:58.742 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:90%
she would talk to the plants.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And the plants will
raise their hand.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we
can help with that.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so yesterday we were also
discussing about going back

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:90%
to our ancestors.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:90%
You know, we got educated.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:90%
What a pity, education.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So now we rely on a part of
us that doesn't know anything.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how many titles.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But this also represents
a student of mine

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:90%
that was an accountant, like me.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And she also could talk to
washing machines and things

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.630 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So one day she came to the
training, and she said,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Mabel I quit my job.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to open a flower shop.

00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said,
Christine, but do you

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:90%
know anything about flowers?

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no,
but I just know

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:90%
I need to open a flower shop.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So the following
training she comes.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I opened
the flower shop.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And what happened is that when
I go to the flower market,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
I go with a list of the
flowers that I need.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
If I have a party and I have
to prepare the centerpieces,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:90%
or if somebody order.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
But I go and I say,
who's coming with me?

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And she can see the
flowers raising their hand.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So she says,
sometimes some flowers

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that I don't have on my
list also raise their hand.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:90%
But I trust and I buy them.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a Sunday, and I'm
coming to the shop.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:90%
And I'm pulling the key.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And I hear the phone ringing.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I pick up the phone,
they order those flowers.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, so how many
of you are waiting

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
to open your own-- to
follow your dreams,

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to become independent, because
you are missing something?

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
You are missing education,
or you don't have the money.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But amazing things
happening when you trust.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you stop the worrying,
instead of being in the future,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:90%
you come back to present.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
When you let go of the
past, when you forgive, yes?

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
conscious enough

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:84%
to realize you are in the
past, or you are in the future.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So one day Ihaleakala
heard a noise.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So he tuned in, like
you used to say.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And he saw God in
the rocking chair.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And he asked God,
what are you doing?

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And God said, oh, I
have so much time.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.083 align:middle line:90%
Because nobody talks to me.

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, they'd rather
talk to their neighbor,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:84%
their psychology, but
nobody talks to me.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
So I keep creating
more galaxies,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.720 align:middle line:90%
and I have so much time.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:90%
So talk to God.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:90%
He's always there to listen.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you understand by God,
let me explain what I call God,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and when I found it.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I heard all these
stories, one day I said,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let go and trust.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean what do I have to lose?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I said, I'm going
to let go and trust.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So that let go and trust took
me to start seeing results.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
Things started happening.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, can you imagine
from a tax accountant

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.860 align:middle line:84%
to traveling the world
with this message?

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't do it on my own.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:90%
I have help.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
One day, somebody asked
me if I had a marketing

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:84%
department, somebody knocking
at doors for me, opening doors?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And that day I started thinking.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, no, I don't
have a marketing department.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that my marketing
department is up there.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So how do I receives from
the beginning my new career?

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%
It's all managed by emails.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I just receive emails
with invitations.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I just receive
emails with offers

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
to buy the copyrights
of my books.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm a published author.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't make sense, and
so it's not about knowing.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not about education.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the money.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
It's about opening our
mind, trusting, living more

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
in the present,
being more conscious.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:90%
This one is crazy, crazy.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
But now that I've
been in Avalon,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.465 align:middle line:84%
I know these creatures
really exist.

00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:41.350 align:middle line:10%
So Morrnah Simeona
prepared two individuals.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.380 align:middle line:10%
One was Dr. Ihaleakala
to give this seminars.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:10%
Another was a lady that
used to meditate with her.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Even when they got by
inspiration, channelled

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
the new Ho'Oponopono
for the modern times,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.330 align:middle line:84%
she helped Morrnah also
with the meditations.

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was so amazing when
they meditated together.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because Ihaleakala
would say, I see these.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And she would say, I see it too.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
He would say, could you
check if we can ask this?

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.720 align:middle line:10%
And she would say, I see a
check-mark, or I see a yes.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And Ihaleakala used to
consult a lot with her.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And one day I said,
did she ever tell you

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.240 align:middle line:90%
that you heard incorrectly?

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.352 align:middle line:84%
She said no, but if I
had somebody to check,

00:11:29.352 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I just want to be sure.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So one day she calls, and
she says, could you check?

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I see my
windows are rattling.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what's going on.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he meditated and
when he came back, he says,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:90%
did you cut some trees today?

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
And she said, yeah, we cut
some trees in the property.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, they
are there fairies

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240 align:middle line:90%
knocking at your window.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They are very mad, because
you left them without a house.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So I was in Avalon.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.110 align:middle line:84%
In Avalon, they said,
there is a lot of magic.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm a tax senior accountant
connecting with magic?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I mean, crazy.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
But it was magical.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Not only the magic part, but
everything that happened there,

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:90%
when you open up.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
So one day we had a
lot of confirmation

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
in this spiritual retreat
like, for example,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.950 align:middle line:84%
in Mount Shasta
a student of mine

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
got confirmation that
Ho'Oponopono really

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:90%
comes from other galaxies.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what Ihaleakala
used to say.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And one day I decided
to erase that.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And I put, it comes from
the original Hawaiians

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:90%
that inhabited Hawaii.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%
But it was true.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
We got confirmation of that.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And then we got confirmation
about when you do Ho'Oponopono,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.610 align:middle line:90%
the universe does it for you.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Our part is so easy.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It is same thing here.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:84%
It is stopping the intellect,
and then it's giving permission

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:90%
to a part of you that knows.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I never told you what
I call, God, Yes?

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Rewind.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I started,
I was telling you.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
When I started letting
go and trusting,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:84%
things started
happening to me, instead

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:90%
of me pushing like always.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm not alone.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So I realized that we all
have a part of us that knows.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, we are always
listening to the intellect.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton says, we
walk with two antennas.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And everybody-- Bruce
Lipton, Gregg Braden,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Joe Dispenza; I mean
everybody, well yesterday Papa

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Jaime, and everybody; we are
all saying the same thing.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
The problems are in
the subconscious mind.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't look any farther.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They are closer than
your own breath.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.430 align:middle line:84%
By like I always say, there are
different paths, different ways

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
to erase, to clean
the subconscious mind.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.640 align:middle line:90%
But I found the easiest way.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
find easier than this.

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is working
directly with God.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
That is the part of you that
knows, it's the other antenna.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to be able to shut down
this one to be able to listen.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to be
more in silence, to listen.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to
trust more, to let go more.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you won't
believe your life.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to know, I have
challenges, I have problems.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
The universe is very sure
to give me opportunities.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They you teach what
you need to learn.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like my life is,
ah, I don't have any problems.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Do Ho'Oponopono.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:53.140 align:middle line:84%
The idea is we are going to
have the problems anyway.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.410 align:middle line:90%
So how can we go easier?

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:84%
How can we look at problems,
and put a distance,

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and realize we are
not the problem.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:84%
We are identifying with all
that, and we are not that.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
So this Ho'Oponopono that
could be as easy as thank you,

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I love you, it is about
coming back to present.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:90%
It's about asking for help.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:84%
When are we going to realize
we cannot do it alone?

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Look what we created,
because we thought we knew.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's about asking for help,
and allowing for that help

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:90%
to come to you.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many of
you read my first book,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:90%
"The Easiest Way."

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
But in my first book, I
tell the story of creation

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:90%
that Ihaleakala told me.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
That when God put out Adam
and Eve, God told them,

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
I can provide you with
anything you need.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
worry about anything.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
I can provide you with
everything you need.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.410 align:middle line:90%
But he gave them free choice.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a gift And it was in
the form of the apple tree.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And God said, you don't need it.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:90%
This is called thinking.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:90%
You don't need it.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I can provide you with
anything you need.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.610 align:middle line:90%
But we decided to think.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:90%
We are still thinking.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:90%
We are still warring.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We are still coping,
manipulating.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize that
the only way is to let go.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.580 align:middle line:84%
The only way is
to allow God, that

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
is the only one that can
erase the subconscious mind.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So Ho'Oponopono, I
found Ho'Oponopono,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and I love it, because it's
about 100% responsibility.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:51.350 align:middle line:84%
There is no guilt. So what does
it mean to be 100% responsible?

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm responsible for
the memories that

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
are playing in my
subconscious mind that

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
show up in the monitor.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
That's why we keep
repeating things too,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:84%
because until we let go,
they're not going to be erased.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.109 align:middle line:84%
And we will keep
replaying, so important,

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:90%
the 100% responsibility.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.839 align:middle line:84%
I wanted you to know, we have
a fun tool in Ho'Oponopono.

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.550 align:middle line:90%
We have many, many.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.672 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
that Ho'Oponopono is,

00:17:18.672 --> 00:17:19.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, and I love you.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's say that that's one
tool that Joe Vitale created,

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
when he wrote the
"Zero Limits" book.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what I learned.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.510 align:middle line:84%
That's not what I
practice, because actually

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
explain this more.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But actually the
thank you and the I

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.360 align:middle line:84%
love you replace
what Ho'Oponopono is.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Please forgive me,
for whatever is in me.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:90%
We become children again.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we are not guilty.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.600 align:middle line:90%
But what is it in me?

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm giving
permission to be erased.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So I was telling you, in
Avalon we got confirmation.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Actually somebody
saw how this fun tool

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.890 align:middle line:84%
that we use that
is called flypaper,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
she had in a meditation this
experience of people wanting

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.650 align:middle line:90%
to come into this place.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.920 align:middle line:90%
But they would bounce and drop.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was like when you
drive, and on the windshield

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.750 align:middle line:84%
the mosquitoes, or the
flies, or something.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So she was shocked by it.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know
what was going on.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And the voice said--

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:90%
it has the same effect.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:90%
It was the same as the flypaper.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So some people in the
trainings had that experience

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.010 align:middle line:84%
that my student in
Mount Shasta had,

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:45.190 align:middle line:84%
where he said they
put him in a blender,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and he could see things
flying out of his body.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And some people have experience
even in the seminars.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And that confirmed,
because he asked.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.115 align:middle line:90%
He says, what do I do here?

00:18:58.115 --> 00:18:58.990 align:middle line:90%
And they say, no, no.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Here you don't do anything.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:90%
We do it for you.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine that
we have all this help,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but because we
don't ask, we end up

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:12.500 align:middle line:84%
going again replaying the
thinking and the worrying.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.290 align:middle line:90%
But that's really how it works.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Because when he went
into this meditation,

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.370 align:middle line:84%
they were taking him
to different rooms.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but I
practice Ho'Oponopono.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So they told him, oh, you
practice Ho'Oponopono.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Come this way, and they
put them in their blender.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So anyway one day, I told that
story to my son that is here

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me with
kind of a weird face,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and he says, I think mom,
this is just too much for me.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.330 align:middle line:90%
So this was my response to him.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, the thing that I
cannot see or I can not hear,

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.420 align:middle line:84%
by considering opening my
mind that maybe exists,

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:90%
it changed my life.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I tell
you, for me the most

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:06.700 align:middle line:84%
important and the change was
about that, opening my mind.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Opening my mind, knowing
that the help is there,

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to start
talking to you about trusting

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
something that you cannot
see, you cannot hear,

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:90%
you cannot feel.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there for us.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is a poem that
is called "Letting Go."

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Giving up
is merely quitting.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Letting go is sweet release.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is cries of anguish.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Letting go is perfect peace.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is hard and heavy.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Letting go is loose and light.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.990 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is simply failure.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Letting go, success in sight.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is very human.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Letting go is most divine.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.620 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is death at sundown.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Letting go, the rising sun.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Giving up is 'There, It's over.'

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:90%
Letting go, 'I've just begun.'"

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So every time I let
go, I go to zero,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and that's where everything
that we are looking for is.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what inspiration is.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm thinking,
inspiration cannot come

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.920 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
If I'm worrying, inspiration
cannot come in my life.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be able
to moment by moment,

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:90%
take me back to zero.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So I you notice I'm engaging,
because I still engage.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:90%
I still blame.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.950 align:middle line:90%
I still complain, like you.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, I'm
conscious I'm doing it.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So I go back to this
letting go as soon as I can.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Keep our mouth shut, and thank
you, thank you, thank you,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:90%
thank you, thank you.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.780 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where you
have a possibility for things

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said, you know,
keep doing the same thing

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and expecting different
results, insanity.

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's, yeah we
are kind of insane.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:90%
But, yes, we let go.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have
plenty to let go.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:09.830 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it,
even blaming yourself.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.170 align:middle line:10%
Complaining of the
circumstances and events,

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.120 align:middle line:10%
always thinking that
there is something

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.760 align:middle line:10%
out there that that's
why we are not happy.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.520 align:middle line:10%
That's why we are not at peace.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Justifying ourself for
the lack of results,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:10%
always, well it was
somebody's fault,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:10%
or this or this
happened, or the storm.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:10%
Or having to defend
your position,

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.860 align:middle line:10%
I think when you really
believe in yourself,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to
defend anything.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:10%
So one of the most
important messages or advice

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.540 align:middle line:10%
that I received
from Dr. Ihaleakala,

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.660 align:middle line:10%
was that I had to be
myself when I presented.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to go and take classes,
if I was a tax accountant.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, if
I'm going to teach,

00:22:57.050 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:90%
I have to go and take classes.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And he said, no, that will
take all your naturality.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:90%
All you have to be is yourself.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And could you tell the
person next to you,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.701 align:middle line:90%
all you have to be is yourself?

00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you can,
write it down too.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very, very
important just to be yourself.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.750 align:middle line:90%
What a concept.

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.040 align:middle line:90%
We are never ourselves.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:84%
We have always been whatever
other people want from us,

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.040 align:middle line:90%
expectations.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We are always looking
for acceptance outside

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And even when we get
it, we are not happy.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
So my mother used
to come to visit,

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:49.530 align:middle line:84%
and she used to tell me,
look at the house you have,

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and brand new cars, and
the husband that loves you,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and two kids that are
beautiful and healthy.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.935 align:middle line:84%
And she would say,
what's your problem?

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what to answer,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.500 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't know
what my problem was.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.000 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have it clear.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:90%
She said, what's your problem?

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:90%
I was not happy.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point, I realized
it wasn't in the cards.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't in the house.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it was that
search that never ends.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Because we will never find it.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that happened
is that my mother passed away.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of revelations
and insights because of that.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:37.300 align:middle line:84%
It was an amazing gift,
and experience, and wisdom

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:90%
from my mother's death.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I realized
because we cremated her,

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and when we went
in Argentina to do

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:84%
what she asked for us, to
spread the ashes, I realized.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, she went with nothing.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:90%
That is an important concept.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We only take our experiences,
and that's what we came from,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
the experience,
not to accumulate.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.700 align:middle line:84%
So that is a very
important concept.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I said that we
should take that really

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
as a big teacher, first of all,
not to be afraid, because there

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:90%
is nothing to be afraid.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So realizing that we are not
this, that this is temporary.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:90%
This is a suit.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:90%
We need it to come here.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And being able to enjoy life
more, to be more present.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:90%
We are never present.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we are more
afraid of actually enjoying

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:90%
life, than from death.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:53.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's a good thing, because
sometimes you have to think.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.300 align:middle line:84%
When you have a problem,
sometimes you have to think,

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:90%
if I knew I would leave today.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:00.890 align:middle line:90%
This would be so important.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.325 align:middle line:84%
Or if I knew this
person would go today,

00:26:04.325 --> 00:26:07.280 align:middle line:84%
would I be still
mad at this person?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you have to take
yourself out of the situation.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Be the observer.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.390 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:84%
That's our real
identity, the observer.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.830 align:middle line:90%


00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:90%
So we all play games too.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
We all play games, and what
happened with the games

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
that we play that we don't
realize they are games,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.910 align:middle line:90%
and we are addicted.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes we start these games.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
other people start.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But this also takes us from
out of zero, of present.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:90%
We are not aligned.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.720 align:middle line:90%
We are not in balance anymore.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And definitely it
takes away peace.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And all we are
looking for is peace.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.670 align:middle line:84%
All we are looking
for is happiness.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The abundance comes,
it will be added.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.030 align:middle line:84%
We always put abundance,
wealth, the money first.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually
the other way around.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.760 align:middle line:84%
You become a
magnet, when you let

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
go, when you'll be
leaving yourself,

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.850 align:middle line:84%
when you're not attached, when
you don't have expectations.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.110 align:middle line:10%
So some of the games that
we play, sometimes we

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:middle line:10%
play that I deserve,
entitlement, so

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:10%
sometimes being
conscious of this.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.500 align:middle line:10%
I don't know you guys.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.580 align:middle line:10%
But in Argentina, when I was
little and we were playing,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:10%
we would say, I
don't play anymore.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And we would leave.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it didn't work.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So we would say, I
don't play anymore.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Or when you were losing
with somebody, you say,

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't play anymore.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.180 align:middle line:90%
So why don't we do it now?

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we realize that we
play these games, sometimes

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, sometimes in
our romantic relationships,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes in
business relationships?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.810 align:middle line:84%
I deserve, or I must be
seen, I'm superwoman.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:12.820 align:middle line:84%
But I know what's
going on inside of me

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to be that superwoman,
for people to see me.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:90%
So also why?

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing it?

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Very, very important.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:90%
And I am better than, yeah.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.380 align:middle line:90%
The thing is we are not happy.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have
to race, increase

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:90%
the effects of other people.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, even if we
confirm that we are better,

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:90%
we are not happy.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And again, we are not
receiving the results

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:90%
that we are looking for.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm worse than, yeah, or I'm
a victim, or things like that.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you realize you are
playing that, you can just say,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm not playing anymore.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So you become a
child, and you realize

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.330 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't work for you.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And you let go.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.240 align:middle line:90%
So it is about letting go.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Ho'Oponopono is about
letting go, and letting God.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.100 align:middle line:84%
No matter what you
understand by God, but let's

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:84%
call it a more intelligent mind
than yours, a mind that thought

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:19.710 align:middle line:84%
of oceans, or mountains, or
rivers, or the human body.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.070 align:middle line:90%
What about that?

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.490 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.690 align:middle line:84%
So there is a more
intelligent mind than ours

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that has all the solutions
to all our problem.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's waiting to see
if we give permission,

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:90%
if we let them.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.870 align:middle line:90%
So you decide.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Because we go through life.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to remove
it, but it hurts.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Just remove move
it, and that's it.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.330 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So you're going
to feel the pain.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard that already
I'm sure, pain is inevitable.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.460 align:middle line:90%
Suffering is optional.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So the suffering, how many of
us have relationships to let

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:84%
go, things that don't work
in our life, and we keep--

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
trust ourself, or we

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.850 align:middle line:84%
engage with fear, or things like
that; so very, very important

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.840 align:middle line:84%
that you decide that
you are ready to let go.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So like I said
before, Ho'Oponopono

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
is I'm sorry, please
forgive me for whatever

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.070 align:middle line:90%
is in me that created this.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.483 align:middle line:10%
When I learned Ho'Oponopono,
the thank you and I

00:30:25.483 --> 00:30:26.400 align:middle line:10%
love you didn't exist.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.620 align:middle line:10%
We had a very long
phrase to repeat.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing in Ho'Oponopono

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:41.380 align:middle line:84%
is how to do it all the time,
because the memories play

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.180 align:middle line:90%
24 hours a day.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
do in the seminar,

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to train the subconscious
mind to do it.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.980 align:middle line:84%
In open Ho'Oponopono,
the subconscious mind

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:90%
is your inner child.

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's not your inner
child, when you were little

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and the things that they
did to you in this lifetime.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Because that subconscious
mind comes with you

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.570 align:middle line:90%
from other lifetimes.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And all the memories
that accumulate,

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:06.100 align:middle line:84%
most of our problems come
from other lifetimes.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.310 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing to do
with what is happening now.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:90%
But we react, we engage.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that is the other
person or the situation,

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's never that.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So who's going to
take responsibility?

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Who's going to
turn on the light?

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we do it, it gets
you away from everybody.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't know
if you saw that video

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
that goes in YouTube about DNA.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.470 align:middle line:90%
We end up all being cousins.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we are all family.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the difference
between spirituality

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.010 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't have anything
against religion,

00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and I always tell
people If you find

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
the peace and the
happiness there,

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:90%
you have to keep with religion.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But that your religious
doesn't mean that you trust,

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:53.760 align:middle line:90%
that you believe.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was told that
by religious people.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:84%
They said, we have religion,
but today you gave us

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.380 align:middle line:90%
a lesson about trusting.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we do it
for the wrong reason--

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:08.920 align:middle line:84%
the family, what other people
will say, to be accepted,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:90%
not to go to hell.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.900 align:middle line:84%
But maybe they are not
for the right reasons,

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.040 align:middle line:84%
so always the why,
why we do things.

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.197 align:middle line:84%
If you know why you do
it, there will be things

00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:90%
that maybe you don't like.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality
goes beyond that.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.560 align:middle line:90%
It gives the power back to us.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.280 align:middle line:84%
There is nobody on earth
that knows, nobody,

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:84%
but you have the
power to connect

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.880 align:middle line:84%
with all the wisdom
of the universe,

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:90%
again with the other antenna.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
You can work with
divinity directly.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
You don't need intermediaries,
no third parties.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I learned
Ho'Oponopono, cleaning,

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
because we talk about
cleaning, Ho'Oponopono,

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:84%
erasing these memories;
it was 200,100,000 pillar

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:84%
of the peace of I, of
myself, my family, relatives,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.130 align:middle line:90%
and ancestors.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.930 align:middle line:84%
That was Ho'Oponopono
when I learned it.

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we had to do a
mental list of the things

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that we thought we
were cleaning with.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And we would spend
in the seminar

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
45 minutes, an hour, people
writing all their boyfriends,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and all the addresses, where
I live, and things like that.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And then we realized that
God knows everything.

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.940 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't need any list.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's our intellect
that needs the list.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
But God knows when we
are ready to let go,

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.890 align:middle line:84%
knows why we have the
problems that we have,

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and he has the solutions.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.140 align:middle line:90%
It's only waiting.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.990 align:middle line:90%


00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
We used to have to say
200,100,000 pillar of the peace

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.860 align:middle line:84%
of I, and made
mental list, whatever

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.510 align:middle line:90%
came to mind in that moment.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And when I went blank, I
had to start all over again.

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.310 align:middle line:84%
200,100,000 pillar
of the peace of I,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of myself, my family,
relatives, and ancestors.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And we would repeat
that 24 hours.

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious
mind never sleeps.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
want to train it,

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to clean like we say,
during the night,

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.620 align:middle line:90%
when the intellect gets tired.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So we realized God
knew everything.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We realized he
didn't need any list.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And one day doctor
Ihaleakala heard

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the boy said, just tell
them to say thank you.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I know what they mean.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when a lot
of very easy tools

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
came, because we
have many, plenty.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:84%
One day I ask Ihaleakala,
why so many tools?

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Why not just thank
you and I love you?

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And his response
was, different taste.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.790 align:middle line:10%
We have for all tastes.

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
So the thank you, replace the
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.980 align:middle line:84%
God already knows
what we are doing.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.670 align:middle line:84%
We are giving
permission to be raised.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We are giving permission
for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.098 align:middle line:84%
And all I have to say is thank
you, thank you, thank you,

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.890 align:middle line:84%
thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you;

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:06.270 align:middle line:84%
instead of engaging
with the stories,

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:10.590 align:middle line:84%
because we keep telling
ourselves stories.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We are creating it,
and we are buying it.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
I already told you

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.420 align:middle line:90%
about the difference or not.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I spoke a little bit about
guilt versus responsibility.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:84%
I felt free for the
first time in my life,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:84%
when I realized I
was 100% responsible.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Because my thought was,
oh, I am 100% responsible.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.760 align:middle line:90%
So it means I created it.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.820 align:middle line:84%
I said, if I created
it, I can change it.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you are
giving your power away,

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you are waiting always,
for other people to change.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still doing it.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I have areas of my
life that I am still

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.260 align:middle line:90%
waiting for people to change.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.185 align:middle line:90%
But guilt is not a relief.

00:35:58.185 --> 00:36:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not a nice feeling.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:90%
And you are hurting yourself.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It's one of of the worst
feelings you can have, guilt.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's one day you have to
get to the point that says,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.380 align:middle line:90%
I love myself too much.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
hurt myself anymore.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to do things
that really work for you.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I learned
with Ho'Oponopono

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
was just to put
myself first, instead

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.140 align:middle line:90%
of pleasing other people.

00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do it
and you are not happy,

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
if you are sacrificing, if
it doesn't work for you;

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.990 align:middle line:90%
it will not work for them.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.390 align:middle line:90%
And everybody feels that.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't work.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So again, thank you, I love
you, came to replace that.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.430 align:middle line:84%
So what we are doing
in Ho'Oponopono,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:51.830 align:middle line:90%
we are taking responsibility.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:53.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry for whatever is in me.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.090 align:middle line:90%


00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
How many of you know
the work of Dr. Emoto?

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The Japanese doctor
that did the whole study

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of the effect of our
thoughts in the water.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we are mostly water.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So the worst thing
that we can do

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.040 align:middle line:84%
is think bad about
ourselves, and feeling

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we don't deserve it, or
feeling we are not good enough.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So the left one,
just in case there

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.870 align:middle line:84%
is somebody that has
never seen these,

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is water seen
through a microscope,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.970 align:middle line:84%
when we say to the water, I
hate you, or you are stupid,

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:90%
you are bad.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.475 align:middle line:84%
And the other one is
when you say thank you,

00:37:37.475 --> 00:37:38.930 align:middle line:90%
or you say I love you.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.900 align:middle line:84%
He studies with rice,
and a lot of people

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.280 align:middle line:84%
are doing it now, with
kids in the schools.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.910 align:middle line:84%
So he put three containers
with white rice.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And he put in one,
he put I love you.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.750 align:middle line:90%
The other one they put--

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- I hate
you or you are stupid.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.950 align:middle line:90%
And the other one they ignore.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So after-- I don't know if it
was after 30 days or something

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:09.290 align:middle line:84%
like that, and the study
is they show it in YouTube.

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So after a certain time, the
one that they put I love you,

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:90%
stay white.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.360 align:middle line:90%
The rice was OK.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It didn't smell, nothing.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The one that they put I hate
you, it turned it rotten.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the one that they
ignore, worms grew from it.

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So these are things that you
can do at home too, and try it

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:36.530 align:middle line:90%
if you don't believe me.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to show
you a video from IKEA.

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.910 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've seen this.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to share
this, for you to see

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.124 align:middle line:90%
the power of our thoughts.

00:38:48.124 --> 00:38:49.585 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:38:49.585 --> 00:38:58.351 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.351 --> 00:39:01.780 align:middle line:10%
Can you all read or do
you want me to read?

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:10%
At IKEA we believe.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
So they went the extra mile
to spray some positivity.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So they pick two plants
from their own store.

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.770 align:middle line:90%


00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.520 align:middle line:84%
They place it at
[INAUDIBLE] in a school.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The two of them, the
same, at the same time.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And they ask the students to
record messages to the plants.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.700 align:middle line:84%
To one plant they
would say nice things.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.705 align:middle line:90%
And the other one they bully.

00:39:34.705 --> 00:39:36.705 align:middle line:84%
>> (ON VIDEO) Seeing you
blossom makes me happy.

00:39:36.705 --> 00:39:38.955 align:middle line:84%
>> (ON VIDEO) You're making
a difference in the world.

00:39:38.955 --> 00:39:41.658 align:middle line:90%
>> (ON VIDEO) You are beautiful.

00:39:41.658 --> 00:39:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> (ON VIDEO) I brought
them here to see the plant.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It says, I came here to
watch that plant being bullied.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:50.010 align:middle line:90%
This is not normal.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So the students were
recording the messages.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) I think it's
an excellent project to have

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.330 align:middle line:10%
something tangible that they can
actually physically be a part

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:10%
of is, I think, going
to very powerful.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.680 align:middle line:10%
>> So a powerful experiment
for the kids to see.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So after 30 days, the
results spoke for themselves.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> (ON VIDEO) I started noticing
that the one that was being

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.810 align:middle line:90%
bullied started--

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Look what happened to the
plant that was bullied 30 days

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:21.940 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.357 align:middle line:10%
>> (ON VIDEO) While the plant
that was being complimented,

00:40:24.357 --> 00:40:28.824 align:middle line:10%
it was flourishing
and beautiful.

00:40:28.824 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's raised the
profile massively

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.850 align:middle line:84%
of different forms of
bullying on the effects

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.225 align:middle line:84%
that bullying can
have on people.

00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:10%
>> We aim to create happier
communities for a better

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:44.758 align:middle line:10%
everyday with this initiative.

00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:10%
And share it with the world.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's what our
power is, our thoughts.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.655 align:middle line:84%
It says if affected a
plant, it definitely

00:40:55.655 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:90%
can effect other people.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
only thinking about it.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:05.810 align:middle line:10%
You don't even have to say
it, just thinking about it.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'll show you this, just to
show you how powerful we are,

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and why a simple thank you or
a simple I love you could work,

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and why it's what I call it the
easiest way, if we practice it.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not about knowing it.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.070 align:middle line:84%
You have to practice, especially
when the problems come.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.810 align:middle line:84%
The problems are
not the problem.

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Our reaction to the
problem is the problem.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you choose to do
this, it's about letting go,

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:39.340 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the reaction,
letting go of the perception.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we don't see the
same thing that others see,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:84%
because we all come with our own
memories, and our own programs.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.510 align:middle line:90%
So we don't see the same thing.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't understand how
other people cannot see it.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's because they
have different programs.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Now that we work
with computers, we

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:01.290 align:middle line:90%
understand, different programs.

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And all that is in
our subconscious mind.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:84%
So very important to
realize how powerful we are,

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:13.430 align:middle line:90%
and this is one of my favorites.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.260 align:middle line:84%
This represents Morrnah,
also Ihaleakala's teacher.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:21.260 align:middle line:84%
When she was little, she was
afraid to cross the street.

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:22.690 align:middle line:90%
So she would ask for help.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.780 align:middle line:10%
And she would see a huge
hand coming from heaven

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.280 align:middle line:10%
and crossing her.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to tell
you, I have students,

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.150 align:middle line:84%
many students in their world
that have seen that hand too.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And many students that they
see things that I cannot see,

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.320 align:middle line:10%
or I see them in
a different way.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.590 align:middle line:84%
I have a certain perception,
but I cannot see how they see.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And lately I realize that
Ihaleakala always told me,

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.945 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to see.

00:42:54.945 --> 00:42:55.745 align:middle line:90%
It's really scary.

00:42:55.745 --> 00:42:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And now when I have all
these people writing me,

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.300 align:middle line:84%
because it's like these
people are coming out more.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%
These people never shared
what they could see, or hear,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:15.480 align:middle line:84%
or what they knew; because they
were afraid to be burned again.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Or they were afraid
that they would

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.860 align:middle line:90%
be put in a mental hospital.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Ihaleakala always told
me, I could have ended up

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.890 align:middle line:90%
in a mental hospital.

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And he would say,
could we stop the radio

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:31.920 align:middle line:90%
for five minutes, or the movie?

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And he would hear
the voice say, no.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So now when people tell me
what happens in my seminars,

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I say, thank god I don't see.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Because they are great
things that are happening,

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.440 align:middle line:90%
but they are very distracted.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So I remember now that
when we did the training

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:51.530 align:middle line:84%
with Ihaleakala, every 20
minutes he would take a break.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.440 align:middle line:90%
He would say, break.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And everybody would look at me
like, we just came from break.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I realize it was
overwhelming to give a class

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.640 align:middle line:90%
with those things happening.

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do
with Ho'Oponopono?

00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We come out of mind
and we take control.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you, when
I say let go, say let go.

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.940 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.740 align:middle line:90%
I learned.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Somebody told me, use your head.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Or they said, you
are not worried?

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:90%
You are irresponsible.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.460 align:middle line:90%
They're wrong messages.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So one day I told my son,
I said, life could be easy.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and he said, that's

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:36.936 align:middle line:90%
not what you used to tell me.

00:44:36.936 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:90%
And I say, I know.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But now I know a
little bit better.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So it could be as
hard, or as difficult,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.030 align:middle line:90%
or as easy, or as we make it.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:49.910 align:middle line:90%
We make our life.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not the President.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:52.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not your neighbor.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not your partner.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.430 align:middle line:90%
It's us.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
when you realize that,

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:90%
you set yourself free.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.520 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:07.333 align:middle line:90%
So how do we con our minds?

00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:08.500 align:middle line:90%
And we are going to see now.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But just realize
that when you talk

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.110 align:middle line:84%
about how bad your
reality is, you attract

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.280 align:middle line:90%
more of what you don't like.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.930 align:middle line:90%
Where do we put our energy?

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:20.370 align:middle line:90%
Where do we put our attention?

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.920 align:middle line:10%
Because we are like cameras.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:28.740 align:middle line:10%
So whatever we focus on, that's
what we get, realizing that.

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:31.500 align:middle line:10%
And maybe in that moment,
I need to breathe.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.550 align:middle line:10%
I need to go and hug
a tree, go for a walk.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.780 align:middle line:10%
But no, we are trying not
to always resolve things,

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.767 align:middle line:10%
and again, from intellect.

00:45:40.767 --> 00:45:42.600 align:middle line:10%
The intellect knows how
to create a problem.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know how
to find a solution.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:47.580 align:middle line:84%
The solutions always
come from inspiration;

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:51.530 align:middle line:84%
when you're taking the shower,
you're connecting with nature.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
So when you are against
something or somebody,

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like, wow, have you
noticed that those days that you

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:05.980 align:middle line:84%
don't sleep well, it looks like
nobody slept well that day.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything is against you.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Nothing works.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:90%
So it could be that it's us.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.860 align:middle line:84%
When you are worried
about something,

00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.300 align:middle line:90%
you attract more of that.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.500 align:middle line:90%
You attract more worry.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:90%
Things get worse.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
know that everything

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:23.520 align:middle line:90%
will pass, everything.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, it's
changing the channel.

00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:32.460 align:middle line:84%
In the moment, realizing you've
been listening to the channel

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that it is about luck,
about not enough,

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:44.010 align:middle line:84%
about injustice, and many other
things, or victimhood even.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So one day you have
to wake up and realize

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.960 align:middle line:84%
who you are spending
your time with,

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.040 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about.

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Because time is the most
precious thing we have here.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the money.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about how we invest
our time, or how what we do,

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.120 align:middle line:90%
do we do what we love?

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.005 align:middle line:84%
Very important, for
me that's the basic.

00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And we are going to
work on that today.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.150 align:middle line:10%
Because for me a
perfect world is one

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:10%
that we all do what
we love, instead of

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:19.790 align:middle line:10%
because of my career, because
my mom told me, because my luck.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So each choice
has a consequence.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And not choosing an is a choice.

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we are
choosing all the time.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you are not
doing it consciously,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.280 align:middle line:90%
you are still choosing.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You are choosing for
the subconscious mind

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to keep replaying, and playing
the same theme, choosing

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You can always
choose your attitude.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:44.460 align:middle line:84%
When you change your
attitude, that's it.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.210 align:middle line:90%
So we need to start practicing.

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.770 align:middle line:10%
Like I said, it's
not about knowing,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.360 align:middle line:10%
but I need to practice.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.620 align:middle line:10%
So like I said before,
it's changing the station.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.990 align:middle line:10%
We have different stations here.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.280 align:middle line:10%
We have a choice of
changing stations.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And it could be in the moment
that is I'm changing station.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.360 align:middle line:90%
This one is not working for me.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so knowing
that we can change

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:12.380 align:middle line:84%
that emotional vibration,
because we are energy,

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:84%
so we attract based
on our energy.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:18.800 align:middle line:84%
That's why if we slept bad, it
looks like everybody slept bad

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.090 align:middle line:90%
that day.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Because we are responsible
of what we attract.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So we are going to go
into this in a minute.

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But I want to show you
this emotional awareness.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.080 align:middle line:90%


00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:36.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not the best picture.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:90%
But what energy are you at?

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:46.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to pretend or to
expect different results.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:90%
So this is an amazing chart.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:53.310 align:middle line:84%
What it shows, shame is
the lowest vibration, a 20,

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:58.440 align:middle line:84%
guilt 30, apathy 50,
grief 75, fear 75.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet pride, anger,
desire are the lowest.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But look how, when you go to
neutrality, you are just OK.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:middle line:10%
Already you are OK.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.380 align:middle line:10%
So neutrality, that's
what Ho'Oponopono does.

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:10%
It brings us to this
balance, to this alignment.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.090 align:middle line:10%
Be one with God, not engaging.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you go to neutral,
you are in the positive.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:29.320 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you are willing
to take responsibility,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and you say, oh,
or maybe it could

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.550 align:middle line:84%
be that it's easier
than what I thought.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I'm not alone,
my willingness to believe,

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.540 align:middle line:84%
my willingness to let
go, my willingness to let

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.300 align:middle line:84%
go of being right or
having the last word that

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't bring
peace or happiness,

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:50.890 align:middle line:90%
even when I achieve it.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Look at acceptance,
accepting that everything

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.580 align:middle line:90%
is perfect the way it is.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.530 align:middle line:90%


00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:02.680 align:middle line:84%
Accepting, accepting
that God knows better

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:09.760 align:middle line:84%
than us, that we don't know what
is right, becoming more humble.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.080 align:middle line:90%
So just accepting, it puts us.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And well then you
have alignment,

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:90%
we are just not here anymore.

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.100 align:middle line:90%
We are light.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.570 align:middle line:10%
We disappear.

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:23.590 align:middle line:10%
But look at peace, 600,
just to be at peace.

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's what
Ho'Oponopono can do for you.

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:28.180 align:middle line:10%
You might have a lot
of problems around you,

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:30.550 align:middle line:10%
but you're at peace.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You check with yourself, and
a lot of things happening,

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.090 align:middle line:84%
it's you're in the
eye of the hurricane.

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So you see it's happening,
but you are safe here.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.640 align:middle line:84%
The thing is we go into,
because we want analyze,

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:52.410 align:middle line:84%
we want to understand, and
then we get into trouble.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you forgive,
so if we don't forgive,

00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:59.070 align:middle line:90%
we are hurting ourself.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard that
of not forgiving

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:08.590 align:middle line:84%
is about taking the poison,
expecting the other one to die?

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You take it, and say, what
two years, and still alive?

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.980 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But those two years you
hurt yourself, really.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So again, and you were
living in the past.

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:28.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you forgive,
it's a gift to yourself.

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
tell you something,

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:31.170 align:middle line:84%
what I learned in
Ho'Oponopono, it's

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:33.030 align:middle line:90%
not about talking to anybody.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:34.590 align:middle line:90%
It's forgiving in your heart.

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:36.270 align:middle line:90%
It's working on you.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
having to go and tell

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.420 align:middle line:90%
the person you forgive them.

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about forgiving inside
of you, that you don't hurt.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:44.880 align:middle line:90%
And how do I know if I forgive?

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Is I think of that person, and
I just don't have that reaction

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:48.840 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.120 align:middle line:90%
So I'm free from that reaction.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.570 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't mean I forgot.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:55.980 align:middle line:90%
Because some people say, no, no.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I need to-- no, it's
maybe I didn't forget,

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:06.660 align:middle line:84%
but I don't have that reaction,
when I think of that person

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:84%
or what they did to me,
or things like that.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So I can set myself free, and
I can come back to present.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can open doors,
because actually forgiveness

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:17.670 align:middle line:90%
opens doors.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness is like
the oil to a machine.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:90%
It makes the wheels move.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise we are stuck.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:26.790 align:middle line:10%
It's like the law of gravity.

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:32.130 align:middle line:10%
Its power is invisible, but
its effect is extraordinary.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:36.390 align:middle line:10%
So the forgiveness is
included in the Ho'Oponopono.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to ask
you to close your eyes.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:44.715 align:middle line:90%
And we take a deep breath.

00:52:44.715 --> 00:52:48.500 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.725 align:middle line:84%
Many times we tell ourselves,
but I cannot forgive.

00:52:51.725 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:52:55.230 --> 00:53:01.550 align:middle line:84%
To forgive takes strength,
real strength, real strength

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of mind, real strength
of mind and heart

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:10.440 align:middle line:84%
to put peace above
your anger, your upset.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:16.380 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't condoning
what they did.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It means accepting that they,
just like you, are human.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And they make mistakes too.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.290 align:middle line:90%
You can forgive.

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It is your divine
nature to forgive.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Because when truly humble,
we realize we are united.

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And in not knowing what to
do, we do the best we can.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.390 align:middle line:90%
None of us are blameless.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:46.810 align:middle line:84%
When we forgive another,
we only set the other,

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:49.900 align:middle line:90%
but ourself free.

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:90%
It's is a win-win situation.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we tell ourselves,
but they don't deserve it.

00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, the sun
shines on everyone.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't decide who deserves
its light, and who doesn't.

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.910 align:middle line:90%
True love is unconditional.

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And until we ourselves
have attained perfection,

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:17.370 align:middle line:90%
who are we to judge others?

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we have
this voice that says,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:22.530 align:middle line:90%
but they are not sorry.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Some people believe that if
a person is not remorseful,

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:30.870 align:middle line:90%
they cannot be forgiven.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:90%
This is not true.

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The transformative,
the powerful point

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:44.190 align:middle line:84%
here is to forgive anyway, to
love anyway, to be kind anyway.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Choose forgiveness
over being right,

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and inner peace will
curl up in your lap.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Anger is not a bad thing.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:59.460 align:middle line:10%
Anger is energy, pure energy.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:05.370 align:middle line:84%
When anger arises, be aware of
it, and see a miracle happen.

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:07.800 align:middle line:10%
When anger arises,
be aware of it.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.530 align:middle line:10%
And if you are aware,
you will be surprised,

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:16.310 align:middle line:10%
maybe the greatest
surprise in your life.

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:20.120 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware,
anger disappears.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Anger is transformed.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Anger becomes pure energy.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Anger becomes
compassion, forgiveness.

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.430 align:middle line:90%
It becomes love.

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So there is no need
for anybody to suffer.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Just be aware.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.060 align:middle line:90%
Let awareness be there.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Anger will arise, and will
be consumed by awareness.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:49.830 align:middle line:84%
One cannot be angry
if he is aware.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And one cannot be
greedy with awareness.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And one cannot be
jealous with awareness.

00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Awareness is really
the Golden Key.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.870 align:middle line:90%
So we take a deep breath.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:14.860 align:middle line:84%
We choose to be in
morning day, here and now.

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has paper
and pencil, by any chance?

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:23.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:24.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So living in the present
needs to be at peace.

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So you always check
with yourself.

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Note if you don't
have any problems,

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:35.530 align:middle line:84%
so they are waiting for
everything to happen or solve.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.790 align:middle line:90%
You check with yourself.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Am I at peace?

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.050 align:middle line:90%
Am I present?

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So remember, depression
is too much of the past.

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety is too
much of the future.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And your job is to bring
you back to present.

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So the thank you, the I
love you, in Ho'Oponopono

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.140 align:middle line:90%
brings you back to present.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you want to live.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.010 align:middle line:90%
We talk about the this energy.

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know
that you are very special.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to
take a picture.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to do somebody
else, not Mabel Katz,

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:11.920 align:middle line:90%
but the accountant.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But just know that
you are very special.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.580 align:middle line:90%
You are unique.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:18.670 align:middle line:90%
You are unique.

00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You have unique talents.

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Nobody can do what you
do, or how you do it.

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.180 align:middle line:90%
We are all unique.

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.000 align:middle line:90%
We all have unique talents.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So we are so used to
being complicated that we

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:33.940 align:middle line:90%
reject whatever is simple.

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.510 align:middle line:90%
So Ho'Oponopono is too simple.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So some of you will say,
no, it cannot be this easy.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.710 align:middle line:84%
We are so used to
unhappiness, that we

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:50.620 align:middle line:90%
find happiness suspicious.

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you think
if somebody is very happy,

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, they might
be smoking something.

00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.290 align:middle line:90%
But that's our minds.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize we are
suspicious of happiness.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So all we have to do is realize
that this should be our center.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.220 align:middle line:90%
This is our target.

00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:14.890 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to do it for
the next generation.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:84%
If you have kids, if
you have grandkids,

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.200 align:middle line:84%
your job is to become
happy, because they

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.310 align:middle line:84%
learn from your example,
not from what you say.

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So people can tell
you a lot of things.

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:30.010 align:middle line:90%
But you observe.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we all observe.

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:33.965 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to observe others.

00:58:33.965 --> 00:58:35.560 align:middle line:90%
It's hard to observe ourselves.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:38.520 align:middle line:90%
But we all can tell.

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes so there are no lies.

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:47.020 align:middle line:84%
It's very important to get that
backpack, the heavy backpack,

00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:51.290 align:middle line:84%
the heavy suitcase, full of
being the perfect parents,

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.470 align:middle line:84%
or I have to know
it all, or something

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:57.380 align:middle line:84%
show yourself vulnerable, show
that you are learning too.

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:01.160 align:middle line:84%
You are doing the
best you can too.

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things to be ourself

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:07.970 align:middle line:84%
is that you start
acting yourself.

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Some people will not like it.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's OK, because
what is important

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is what you think
of yourself, not

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.150 align:middle line:90%
what other people think of you.

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:17.710 align:middle line:90%
And everything will come.

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Everything will be added.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:24.010 align:middle line:90%
But in life, we do the reverse.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.350 align:middle line:90%
We think we are what we have.

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if I have so much
money in the bank,

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.140 align:middle line:84%
if I can do this or that,
if I drive a certain car

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.010 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
I am what I have.

00:59:35.110 --> 00:59:37.570 align:middle line:90%
And we live for that.

00:59:37.570 --> 00:59:42.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's the other way around,
just being ourselves, trusting

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:44.680 align:middle line:90%
ourselves, and being present.

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So do you know the difference
between talents and abilities?

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we all went to school.

00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.485 align:middle line:84%
I had the ability
to prepare taxes.

00:59:53.485 --> 00:59:56.530 align:middle line:90%


00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.030 align:middle line:90%
But talent is something natural.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.620 align:middle line:84%
You don't know where
it's coming from.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.430 align:middle line:90%
You're good at it.

01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:03.380 align:middle line:84%
People tell you, oh,
you do that so well.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.180 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh
everybody can do it.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.880 align:middle line:90%
No, not everybody can do it.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.148 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we don't give
ourselves enough credit.

01:00:12.148 --> 01:00:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take you
through an exercise that

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:19.650 align:middle line:84%
helped me to get even more
clear about my talents.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would like you to just
be as natural as you can,

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.170 align:middle line:90%
when you answer these questions.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:26.980 align:middle line:90%
So there will be four questions.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
But the first three
just ask them short,

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
because the fourth
one is just put

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
in the preview of
three together;

01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
so something that you'll
remember when I ask you this.

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So first I have one
very important question

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:47.650 align:middle line:90%
before we do this.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to write down
what the first thing that comes

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:54.360 align:middle line:90%
without thinking.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people confuse
Ho'Oponopono, because they

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%
think it's doing nothing.

01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you do a lot
when you say thank you.

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, remember, you are
coming back to present.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You are giving
permission to God,

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
allowing for the help to
come, et cetera, et cetera.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And letting go is work,
because it's completely

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:21.670 align:middle line:90%
outside of our comfort zone.

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.210 align:middle line:90%
So inspiration comes.

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Ho'Oponopono is about
acting from inspiration,

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.320 align:middle line:84%
speaking from inspiration,
so not thinking,

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.630 align:middle line:90%
being more spontaneous.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why we need to start
thinking as kids again.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.870 align:middle line:84%
So what is the first
thing that comes

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:40.760 align:middle line:90%
when I ask you this question?

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And again it could
be ridiculous today.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:45.860 align:middle line:90%
Write it down.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So what is the first thing
that comes to your mind

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:53.150 align:middle line:84%
when I say, what would you do
even if you don't get paid,

01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:55.010 align:middle line:90%
because you love it?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.770 align:middle line:90%
It gives you so much enjoyment.

01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even
charge for doing that.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.940 align:middle line:90%


01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:05.490 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to charge for
that, if it's natural in you,

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:08.560 align:middle line:90%
you love it, you enjoy it?

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then you will
have the possibility

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to share it with others.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But now it comes, because now
we are going to build on that.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So here comes the
four questions.

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
The first one, please write
down two talents of yours.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:32.020 align:middle line:84%
When you say two talents,
maybe you have more than two.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
But I say write two
talents of yours.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And let me give
you some examples.

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people sometimes
say, I don't have any.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%
I came late.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And there no talents left.

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Being a good
listener is a talent.

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Being detail-oriented
could be talent.

01:02:55.430 --> 01:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
Organized, you can help
others, when you do this.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And I will be sharing with you
what I answer, not because I

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:07.550 align:middle line:84%
put myself as this
great example,

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
but just to give
you also some more

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.930 align:middle line:90%
ideas, what talents could be.

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
When I did this exercise, I put
that my passion and enthusiasm

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.730 align:middle line:90%
are two talents of mine.

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So for you to get out of
the box of what a talent is.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%


01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:30.160 align:middle line:84%
So the second question
is, think a way

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:33.040 align:middle line:84%
you enjoy expressing
those talents when

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.690 align:middle line:90%
you interact with others.

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:38.050 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:42.040 align:middle line:84%
When you do those things,
how do you act in present

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.670 align:middle line:90%
with other people?

01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So how do you use
those talents when

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:49.950 align:middle line:90%
you interact with other people?

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, make it not
too long, because then we

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:53.930 align:middle line:90%
are going to combine them.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:59.140 align:middle line:90%


01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.270 align:middle line:90%
Really for three?

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a world that
is perfect right now.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
How are the people
interacting between themselves

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.320 align:middle line:90%
in that perfect world?

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the description
is in the present

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.270 align:middle line:84%
like it's happening,
and remember

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
perfect world is a fun
place where one likes to be

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.270 align:middle line:90%
and enjoy.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So how does the perfect
world look for you,

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and how to people
interact in that?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Again only just an
idea, I put that

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
a world where everybody
utilizes their natural talents,

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%
and do what they love.

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
That for me would
be a perfect world.

01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Ready for the last one?

01:04:47.270 --> 01:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, the last one, this
sentence, your response

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:55.040 align:middle line:90%
will start with "My purpose is."

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And you are going to combine the
three before So my purpose is

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:02.250 align:middle line:84%
to utilize these
talents, when I wake up

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and when I interact
with other people,

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.610 align:middle line:90%
and what happens in the world.

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So for me it was or
is still, my purpose

01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is to use my passion and
enthusiasm to wake up others,

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
so they can discover
who they really are.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.900 align:middle line:84%
This way they can
use their natural ,

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
talents and do what
they love to do.

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, for me it's we
just need to unlearn

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to be able to relearn,
to trust ourselves,

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.640 align:middle line:84%
to know we can be
ourselves, and make my money

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and have everything we
need when we need it.

01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So when I was asked, what would
you do if you don't get paid?

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I said something
very ridiculous.

01:05:44.970 --> 01:05:45.770 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I found my notes
actually of what I wrote.

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't believe
it was my handwriting.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.797 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody asked me, I
was a tax senior accountant.

01:05:55.797 --> 01:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And when somebody
asked me, what would

01:05:57.380 --> 01:05:58.820 align:middle line:84%
you do even if you
don't get paid,

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
I wrote literally,
travel the world,

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.660 align:middle line:84%
sharing with others
what had helped me.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment,
it was ridiculous.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I am telling
you, write it down.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So if today you can commit,
what is your commitment today?

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.680 align:middle line:84%
That first step you
are going to take,

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
it has to be something
that you can do.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So what will be that first
step towards your dream,

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:35.920 align:middle line:90%
or doing what you love.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Something that you
know, oh, that's easy.

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I can do it this week.

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
I can do it today.

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:41.550 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it Monday.

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, not something that says,
well maybe, I can do this,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.150 align:middle line:90%
maybe I'll call, maybe I'll go.

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
No, no, something that
you say, oh, that's easy.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
That will be my first step,
something that you commit.

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Our commitment is very
important, to know why you

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%
are doing it is very important.

01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And be sure you don't do
anything for money, because

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.140 align:middle line:90%
of the money.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The money will always come
when you do something you love.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to worry.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that you have
to trust enough to go for it,

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and know that you're not
alone, that you're not

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.030 align:middle line:90%
going to do it alone.

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:18.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:22.260 align:middle line:84%
So thank you, sorry I
don't have more time

01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.490 align:middle line:90%
to give you to work on this.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully you will
keep working on this.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.360 align:middle line:90%
So believe in yourself.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Trust your internal GPS.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
We all have that GPS.

01:07:33.270 --> 01:07:34.365 align:middle line:90%
It should be capital.

01:07:34.365 --> 01:07:37.200 align:middle line:90%


01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Always live in the state
of positive expectancy,

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
knowing it will be coming soon,
knowing that what is coming

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.790 align:middle line:90%
is always better, always.

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Even when we go through
changes, it's transformation.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.470 align:middle line:84%
Growing pains sometimes, but
always when we look back,

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:58.980 align:middle line:84%
we said thank God
that that happened.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Because maybe we
wouldn't be here today.

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It's always say thank you to
what you like and thank you

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:06.960 align:middle line:90%
to what you don't like.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Because there is a gift.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
There is always a blessing
behind that you cannot

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:13.810 align:middle line:84%
appreciate it right
now, but you will.

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:18.359 align:middle line:90%
You will realize later,

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.850 align:middle line:90%
So fly blindly.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:23.460 align:middle line:90%
Have no limits.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
There are unknown terrains,
but the process is fascinating.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.479 align:middle line:90%
Life is fascinating.

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:34.680 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, again,
we forgot who we are.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.189 align:middle line:90%
We forgot where our power is.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any clue
of how powerful we are.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's something that
maybe you realized.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you want to write it down.

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:54.910 align:middle line:90%
In this moment I'm aware.

01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I will do my best
to, and I choose.

01:08:58.550 --> 01:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Choosing consciously, choosing
even I'm going to be happy,

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.399 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be at
peace, no matter what

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.819 align:middle line:90%
is going on around me.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:12.649 align:middle line:90%
So taking that--

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
100% responsibility.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.979 align:middle line:84%
I will let go of that
need to be right,

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:20.109 align:middle line:90%
or to have the last word.

01:09:20.109 --> 01:09:22.689 align:middle line:90%


01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I will accept myself
just the way I am.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So there is a tool
that I use a lot.

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:35.670 align:middle line:84%
On my last conference in Malaga,
there were 300 people there.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how many of you
use the I let go and trust?

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:42.609 align:middle line:90%
Most hands went up.

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:46.569 align:middle line:84%
I'm always telling
people, let go and trust.

01:09:46.569 --> 01:09:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Let go and trust.

01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so if I have
a scary situation,

01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:53.319 align:middle line:84%
I just go I let go and
trust, I let go and trust,

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.130 align:middle line:90%
I let go and trust.

01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't allow my stories
to get in the way,

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:00.430 align:middle line:90%
and to scare me more.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So I know that my job
is just to be present,

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:06.430 align:middle line:84%
what Buddha called
the middle way.

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
So we are like these trees.

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:12.280 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be bend,
but hey, we come back.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.250 align:middle line:90%
We always come back.

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So I started telling
you about the book.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So the pictures that I show
you are on my "The Easiest

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Way to Grow" book that comes
with some audio and videos,

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
digital that we give you
access, when you buy the book.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
I find that I put all the
messages of all the things

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that
changed my life.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wow.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.880 align:middle line:84%
If I would have known
this when I was young,

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.970 align:middle line:84%
my life would have
been very different.

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's very
important we allow our kids

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:51.040 align:middle line:90%
to be themselves, to be happy.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And then actually all
these weird stories

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
were in this "Maluhia,
The Happy City."

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.850 align:middle line:90%


01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And they are really
great stories,

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.960 align:middle line:84%
but based on all these weird
concepts, talking to things,

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.430 align:middle line:90%
or being ourself.

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So the story goes that
in this happy city,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.760 align:middle line:90%
they practice Ho'Oponopono.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And because they become
such a happy city,

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.890 align:middle line:84%
tourists come to
see what they did.

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.470 align:middle line:90%
How did you accomplish this?

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:22.080 align:middle line:90%


01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And the tourist
guides are the kids.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
So they know all these
concepts about Ho'Oponopono,

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and they share it with
the tourists that come.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a wonderful
book for children and adults,

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the same.

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:47.580 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
