[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, welcome, everybody.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.890 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate
you coming out

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.230 align:middle line:10%
to see what's happening
here this evening,

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:10%
and it should be very eventful.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
I hope that what I present
to you tonight will give you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
an insight to some of the ideas
Nikola Tesla had brought about.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm an independent
garage explorer.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:10%
My name is Michael Leas.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:10%
I've been doing this type of
research for close to 20 years

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:10%
now.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:10%
Got inspired with crystal
radios a long time ago.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:10%
My dad gave me a
broadband radio.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:10%
Kind of thought it was really
cool to dial in and hear

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.550 align:middle line:10%
the sounds.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So the main theme
tonight is Nikola Tesla's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:90%
electric universe.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And this information
underneath there

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
says a natural
regenerative energy system.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
We're all searching for
that patterning of energy,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and in the process
of my research,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I ended up finding a
lot of different things

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.050 align:middle line:84%
that gave me evidence that
that's a real reality that we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.945 align:middle line:84%
can do to transform our
magnetic electric fields.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:10%
Nikola Tesla, the
master of lightning.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:10%
If anybody has seen
some of the old footage

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:10%
or even read some
of his books, he

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.850 align:middle line:10%
knew how to cast
a lightning bolt.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And tonight, I'm not
doing that type of stuff,

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
because in the reading
of his information,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.740 align:middle line:84%
he was trying to tame
that and bring it down

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.463 align:middle line:90%
to a usable process.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.130 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't about just
throwing lightning.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you're seeing people out
there doing large Tesla coils,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:90%
that's great.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It's great for display.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I have read
something at one time

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that they mentioned that
Tesla coils were nothing more

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.320 align:middle line:90%
than just a fantasy of Tesla.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.870 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.320 align:middle line:84%
He used it as an instrument
in part of a system

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:90%
that he was building.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Let there be light.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Where we are today,
without Tesla,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.139 align:middle line:90%
we'd be still burning candles.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:10%
So talk about CO2 or what
everybody's worried about,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:10%
we'd be still
having whale blubber

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:10%
and some of that type of stuff.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.392 align:middle line:10%
He harnessed electricity.

00:02:17.392 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of things
going on at that time, a hundred

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:90%
years plus ago.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Michael Faraday found that
if you move a magnet in front

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of a coil of wire, it
moved the electron,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and from that, so many
other things developed out.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:90%
Tesla took that idea.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Faraday was one of his idols,
and Tesla took that idea

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:90%
in his own inspiration.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:90%
He was the thinker.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to emulate or think
and follow what the masters are

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%
doing or have done because
I believe every one of us,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.420 align:middle line:10%
if we truly want
to learn something,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.700 align:middle line:10%
learn what those
have already done it

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:10%
and try to replicate
what they did,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:10%
but in your own variable
of that same theme.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So tonight, what I'm
trying to present to you

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:90%
is this idea Tesla first had.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
We live in electric
sea of energy,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and he thought of
the idea of the Earth

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.780 align:middle line:84%
as part of the grounding
of his Wardenclyffe Tower.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:84%
And he developed a lot of
things when he was in Colorado.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:10%
With that inventive mind, he
brought through the information

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:10%
on how to change or
transform electricity.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.440 align:middle line:10%
At that time, we had--

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure that some
people have seen

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:10%
some of the movie,
Edison and Tesla,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:10%
"The War of the Currents."

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen it yet myself,
but in my understanding,

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
at that time, Edison had DC.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So everything was running
on direct current.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Tesla knew of DC because,
really, AC is chopped DC.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:90%
DC is directional current.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:90%
AC is alternating.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:10%
Inside his lab, he
was in a quietude

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:10%
of his own mind, his own ideas.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:10%
He produced some things
that yet to this day,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:10%
people are still trying
to understand what

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:10%
he was doing with resonance.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Resonance, harmonics,
frequencies--

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Tesla coils function
on those concepts.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.350 align:middle line:84%
It's all patterning of
how energy functions.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So to tie this back
into-- like my wife says,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.210 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I get carried
away in the ideas.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Then you gotta tie
it back to the self.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:90%
So why did I get into this?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
I needed to learn about
healing, healing myself.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So in the process
of learning about

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:84%
energy through
understanding frequency

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and harmonics and different
in-phase, out-of-phase

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
condition that magnetism
and electricity present,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
it taught me what I was
about inside myself.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So in his Colorado workshop--

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've heard
some of the stories--

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
there is where
people were seeing

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.007 align:middle line:90%
some of the lightning bolts.

00:05:00.007 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:10%
He blew out the power
station in Colorado Springs.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:10%
When horses were
walking, they would

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:10%
have-- because they had
the horse shoes on them.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a static charge is
that when they were walking,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you would see electricity
jump from their shoes

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:90%
down to the ground.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
So he was trying to tame that.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.710 align:middle line:10%
We see it as natural power.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:10%
Every one of us,
we've experienced it.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:10%
Electricity is there in the
universe for every one of us.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We feel it even in
our own heartbeat,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
even though we see it as
a calming effect and all

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
these things.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize that it's
the very functioning process

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.630 align:middle line:90%
of what we are today.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Can we harness this force?

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:10%
It's going to take some bright
minds and people who are aware

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.860 align:middle line:10%
not only of the
dangers, because you

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:10%
can see what Mother Nature
in and of herself can do.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:10%
But it also takes that
concept of spirituality

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:10%
because technology
without the mind

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:10%
or without the spiritual
input of ideas,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:10%
all you're going to do is create
more havoc upon the planet.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We see what those things
unleashed to mankind

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:84%
can do you look if the atomic
bomb, the idea of energy

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
transferring to mass and
all that type of stuff that

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
was there.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Tesla was against that
idea of splitting the atom.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think today,
we're at a crux point

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to understand a new
physics, a new idea

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:84%
of how this process of
electricity and magnetism

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
works not only
outside of ourselves,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
but inside of ourselves as
an interdimensional form

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.560 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:90%
This is not child's play.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
This is the real stuff.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
When we're talking
about UFOs and what's

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
here and a different process
of healing of the spirit, which

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.360 align:middle line:84%
really heals the body,
you have to learn

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
to develop into understanding
the high frequency, which

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.288 align:middle line:90%
is spirit.

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
it [FOREIGN LANGUAGE],,

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
which was high-frequency
electricity.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:10%
Let me go back to this-- the
vision, the mystery, the past,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:10%
present, and future.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe, even in
electricity, you

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
have points of interaction--
positive, negative, past,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.570 align:middle line:90%
present, and future.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
this presentation,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.830 align:middle line:90%
that's already my past.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the moment,
and this is where

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:90%
all interaction takes place.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I know there's things
to come in the future.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
That is a principle
of energy, and once we

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:84%
understand that, we can
get beyond time and space.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But until we understand
that and understand

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.390 align:middle line:90%
how these things that are--

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
there are deep
physics equations,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
but really, every one of us
already has it within us.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
When you breathe and you
breathe in, you breathe out,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
your heart functions
in a normal rhythm.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
That idea is already inherent
within the process of man.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.360 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is learn
what's really going on.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:90%
Stop, look, and listen.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
That's all I've
been trying to do.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Shocked a few times, almost
knocked myself out a few times.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
My wife is saying, what's
that sound in the garage?

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just discharged
a capacitor.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:10%
Free energy, the Wardenclyffe
Tower and wireless power.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.289 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
mystery about all that.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.975 align:middle line:10%
I do believe that
there is free energy.

00:08:35.975 --> 00:08:38.350 align:middle line:10%
Somebody came to the booth
earlier and asked me about it,

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.150 align:middle line:10%
and I mentioned to
him, it's everywhere.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's already here.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.223 align:middle line:90%
We're already in it.

00:08:42.223 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
You can do what you want you can
get up and start running really

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:90%
fast.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.417 align:middle line:90%
Where'd you get that energy?

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:90%
That was free.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So really, what
do we want to do?

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's bring this to the
philosophical equation

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that as a society,
what do we want to do?

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not about having energy.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Energy is unlimited.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
We do need electricity,
but you have

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to transform all that to
build a better society.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
So who has the vision
without just wanting

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.490 align:middle line:90%
to run the bankroll?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to also
build the process

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that that's part of the
development of our own society.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So there is an idea
that had gone around

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
that Tesla had a Pierce Arrow.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
That was an electric
car that was

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:84%
able to drive at like
90 miles an hour.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a few bits of
information that it's true.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Some of it may not be true.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
But I do know--

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I have a book.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I should have brought
it with me this evening,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
but it was a patent
trial where Tesla talks

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.310 align:middle line:90%
about this Wardenclyffe Tower.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Right now, that has been
repurchased by the Tesla

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Society up in Long Island
where they actually

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:90%
saved that from demolition.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.540 align:middle line:84%
They are going to
turn it into a museum,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.280 align:middle line:90%
and it's been in process.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:90%
You can go and search about it.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
But at that tower, Tesla in the
patent trial and all the things

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:90%
were there.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.808 align:middle line:84%
He said he did run that,
but he didn't have the money

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
to keep it running.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
He did a lot of
experiments with it.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:10%
Speculation is, he
had the device that

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:10%
fit in the car that
received the frequency

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:24.580 align:middle line:10%
vibration from that car through
the antenna that demodulated

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:10%
down the energy that ran into
whether a storage capacitor

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:10%
or batteries through that
induction of the radiant

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:10%
field back down to
a usable current

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:10%
to be able to run the wheels.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true, then
we are a hundred years

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
late on trying to get
electric vehicles.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.240 align:middle line:90%
We could be there.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:10%
At the time,
Standard Oil was one

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.180 align:middle line:10%
of the bigger people
fighting against because we

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:10%
had a means, a method.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:10%
Still to this day, gasoline
is the biggest bang

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.250 align:middle line:10%
for your buck to be able
to get you somewhere.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:10%
We haven't really learned how
to harness the other forces.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:90%
So how can we fulfill the dream?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not just about Tesla.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
You got to remember, there's
a lot of other people

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:90%
that came around.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
There were a lot of other
things that were going on.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
He was not alone, but he became
shunned by society because some

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
of his outlandish ideas.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Even wireless electricity
was not really understood.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
He was on the cusp
of understanding

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
what it was, and before he could
actually explain what he was

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:84%
finding, they almost pulled the
plug on everything and said,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, we need to put
the meter on what's

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:90%
just been running on the wires.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of the
battle that's been going on.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Westinghouse was very
instrumental in bringing

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.870 align:middle line:84%
about Tesla's idea to the
world in the alternating motor

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.710 align:middle line:90%
and the generator.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Alternating current--
when Tesla harnessed

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the process of the
Niagara Falls and they

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:84%
built that power
station there and he

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
was able to transmit
electricity to,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe, it was the World
Fair at the time in Chicago

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:84%
or wherever it was
at at that moment

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and he was able to light
the place up with AC,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:90%
that put him on the map.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.520 align:middle line:84%
That put you and I on the
map, what we have today.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:10%
Not a lot of people
give Tesla the credit

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.590 align:middle line:10%
of what he was really due in
the building of our society.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:10%
If you go and you read and
you're an electrical engineer,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:10%
not much is mentioned
about Tesla.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:10%
About nine years back, I went
and got my ham radio operators

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:34.870 align:middle line:10%
license just because
I needed to know more.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not schooled
in any engineering.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I am a dropout from college.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a degree.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
This is all just
hands-on experiments

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of reading,
a lot of study,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of trial and error.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Thrown away a lot of stuff
because it didn't work.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But in the process
of finding out--

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Tesla's kind of taboo in the
world because even on an ham

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.340 align:middle line:90%
radio, talk to some of the guys.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
They go, ah, yeah, Tesla.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know anything.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.190 align:middle line:84%
But they don't realize
that Tesla was really

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.690 align:middle line:84%
the basis of why
you now have radio.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:10%
In the course of the whole--

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:10%
what I brought up
about the trial,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.960 align:middle line:10%
it was a trial against Marconi.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:10%
Everybody knows that supposedly
Marconi sent the first signal

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:10%
across the Atlantic.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Marconi was the originator
of radio, not realizing,

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.210 align:middle line:90%
like what I'm doing today--

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Marconi was sitting
in the audience

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of Tesla's presentation
while Tesla ran the coils

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and did what he did to
show wireless electricity

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it may be, went
home, designed his own ideas--

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
conceptualization, just
like what I was doing--

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and claimed to be the
originator because he

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
did beat Tesla to the
punch on dropping that S

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
was that picked up

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.120 align:middle line:90%
the signal across the Atlantic.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.240 align:middle line:84%
That is true, but
Tesla had the concept.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
He learned the
concept from Tesla.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
History doesn't
really tell you that.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.460 align:middle line:84%
At least today, it's
starting to come out.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Tesla died before they
reversed the idea that he

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:90%
was the originator of radio.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:10%
So fulfilling the dream--

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.415 align:middle line:10%
part of this whole idea
is the science of energy.

00:14:14.415 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:10%
It is a science, and we're going
to need to learn that if we do

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.780 align:middle line:10%
want to advance
in our societies.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:10%
At least, that's my belief.

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.170 align:middle line:10%
Electricity, magnetism, the
vortex, frequency, harmonics,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:10%
oscillation, sine wave,
and cyclic motion--

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.540 align:middle line:10%
they all interact
with each other.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:10%
You can't have one
without the other

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:10%
because all function in
some relative relationship

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.600 align:middle line:10%
to each other.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
The pattern emerges--
the atomic field.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:10%
We're all standing
on that field.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:10%
We feel it is hard,
but it is not.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:10%
It's an oscillation of a
vibration at a particular rate

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:10%
that our body
cannot pass through.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:10%
So to say, masters like
Jesus or other people

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:10%
could walk through walls.

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:10%
Because they
understood the process

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:10%
of transposition of their
own system as a spirit,

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:10%
as an energy force.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:10%
So in experimenting
with Tesla coils, what

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.800 align:middle line:10%
I found that we as individuals
have that same relationship.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.680 align:middle line:84%
None of this could be done
without understanding what's

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.840 align:middle line:90%
going on inside ourselves.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We're a principle of
energy, and how you think,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.770 align:middle line:84%
what you do in your life,
interrelates that process

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of that oscillation, of that
yin-yang sine-wave vortex

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.680 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
You're just receiving things
through your eyes, your ears,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:84%
your senses, but really,
it's feeding the information

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
to your own inner higher
self, if you want to call it.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
That is really where life
exists, the inner kingdoms.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:90%
So why do I bring this out?

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not scientific.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:90%
It's all philosophy.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.740 align:middle line:10%
No, it's not, because
if Mother Nature is

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:10%
that pattern, that universal
spiral, and every person you'll

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.575 align:middle line:10%
see here in the course of
slides has that pattern,

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:08.400 align:middle line:10%
it means that we're
all connected up

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:10%
to that interdimensional vortex.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.500 align:middle line:10%
So why does that matter?

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.803 align:middle line:10%
Well, in the process of my
own quest, I wanted to know--

00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:10%
and that's why at
the beginning, I

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:10%
put up brought up this thing
about a natural regenerative

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:10%
energy system.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
A sunflower, if you take one
seed, drop it to the ground,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
water it, and grow it,
it's going to replicate.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.250 align:middle line:84%
It's going to regenerate its
own design to another sunflower

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:90%
or even more.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:10%
So this one sunflower is going
to grow a field of sunflowers.

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:10%
If we understood that
principle in using that concept

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:10%
in regenerating magnetism
and electricity,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:10%
there's your free energy,
all the time, anywhere,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:10%
at any place.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:90%
What is that force?

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the most
efficient means and method

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that nature provides, it's
that Fibonacci growth sequence

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
or the golden means
or the vortex.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
It's in a nautilus shell.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:10%
It's everywhere if you
just begin to look and see.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:10%
So I took that idea,
knowing that, yes,

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:10%
we're all born of starlight.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And I started thinking about
what can you do with that.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.550 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
heck, let's shape it

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:90%
like Mother Nature's doing.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:84%
This kind of goes through,
again, the spiral of man.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.840 align:middle line:10%
We are at the fulcrum,
so in learning

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:10%
about that information, it now
gave me the seed or the idea

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:10%
to apply to a system.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.760 align:middle line:10%
And so tonight, what
I wanted to show is--

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:10%
sitting on the
bench here, there's

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.468 align:middle line:10%
a gear that's developed.

00:18:01.468 --> 00:18:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And I don't have the small one.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I already packed it away for the
ties, but it's a six-axis gear.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And that gear was based
on that Fibonacci design.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:90%
There's a vortex above it.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Let me get through
a few of these,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.157 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll jump across
to a few of those things.

00:18:17.157 --> 00:18:21.450 align:middle line:84%
But the human aura,
the magnetic biofield--

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
all things are going
on inside of us,

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure people want to
see what's happening here.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:10%
So I'm just kind of trying
to at least expose you

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:10%
to this because without
this knowledge of knowing,

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:10%
this is of non-use, OK?

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.370 align:middle line:10%
We have to have both.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:10%
And we've lost that in
our educational values

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.330 align:middle line:10%
or even in our systems.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.100 align:middle line:84%
We're not
understanding that it's

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
a symbiotic relationship
between body, mind,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and spirit in this society.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you feed the
masses, so to say?

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:90%
We're at a quandary.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago, there
wasn't as many people.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.677 align:middle line:84%
Now there's this amount of
people, so what do we do?

00:19:02.677 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So we have to be thinkers.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to
inspire and say, hey,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.680 align:middle line:84%
this is something
we can work with.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.880 align:middle line:10%
So the creative principles
and laws of science--

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.050 align:middle line:10%
again, it comes down to
taking that information

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.140 align:middle line:10%
and applying it to a structure.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:10%
These are some of the books
that I've researched into,

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.460 align:middle line:10%
a man named Ernest Norman.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
He was the founder of the
Unarius Academy of Science,

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and some of you may
know of him or not.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
But in some of the real
hardcore research beyond--

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I broke away from
what they're doing

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:90%
and delved deep into his ideas.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
From that, I built that gear.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.648 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have looked at him,

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and there's been a lot of
controversy around what

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:90%
has come and gone.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But the works that that man
had brought through is unknown.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.567 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:10%
This is something that
was out of that book.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
"We cannot deny the existence
of great spiritual worlds beyond

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:90%
this third dimension.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:10%
In fact, any form of substance,
even the existence of man

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.920 align:middle line:10%
himself, would be
but a hollow mockery,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:10%
a useless and unintelligent
freak of happenstance,

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:10%
unless there were such
great worlds beyond this.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.180 align:middle line:10%
Like all things, large or small,
the Earth and all its creatures

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.270 align:middle line:10%
have been created from this
sublime spiritual stuff.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.240 align:middle line:10%
Each thing, though it
may appear different,

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.850 align:middle line:10%
is a highly developed
organized systems

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.740 align:middle line:10%
of tiny solar systems of
energy and in turn claim

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:10%
as their parent
the very substance

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:10%
of the infinite mind."

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:90%
There's your free energy.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.450 align:middle line:90%
There's your electricity.

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:90%
How do you tap that?

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.613 align:middle line:84%
Mimic Mother Nature,
the only answer

00:20:41.613 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:90%
I've ever been able to find.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.740 align:middle line:90%
That's Ernest Norman himself.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:10%
I truly believe he
was an advanced being,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
just like Tesla.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.373 align:middle line:10%
And if you look at--

00:20:53.373 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:10%
I have to go back
to it, but I had

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:10%
a picture of Leonardo da
Vinci at the beginning

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:10%
with the flying machine
that Leonardo thought about.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla, I believe, could
have been the reincarnation

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:90%
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:84%
He was into wanting
to fly, similar ideas.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So we all transmigrate
through time and space

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to evolve not only
on this planet,

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:84%
but through other
realms of existence.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
We learn from those
realms of existence,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
bring back to this
world to try to help

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.070 align:middle line:84%
mankind, who are struggling
along in the ideas.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That's some of the concepts that
Ernest Norman brought through.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:10%
Again, that's a pattern
of that movement

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.420 align:middle line:10%
of the sine wave, which helped
me understand how Tesla coils--

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:10%
Tesla coils helped me learn
to understand that there's

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.250 align:middle line:10%
a movement of that sine wave.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Life and death is a
movement of the sine wave.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.830 align:middle line:84%
The in and out breathing is
the movement of that sine wave.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:10%
That's his wife, Ruth Norman.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.920 align:middle line:10%
Fascinating information--
it's a hard delve into it.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:10%
Buckminster Fuller-- another
one who found the same pattern.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:10%
Synergetics-- a
name for geometry

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:10%
advanced based on the pattern
of energy you saw in nature.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:10%
Buckminster Fuller
Institute-- geodesic dome,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.790 align:middle line:10%
a natural pattern.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:10%
So I'm trying to draw you into
the point of what's going on,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:10%
So I took those ideas of
that spiral and that vortex,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.580 align:middle line:10%
and I had two cones that were
basically funnels that I bought

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:10%
at the Home Depot, duct taped
magnets onto them in a spiral.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.785 align:middle line:10%
Because that's what
I felt was, OK, well,

00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:10%
if Mother Nature--
let's try this.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:90%
[GROANS]

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's try it again.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:10%
So I taped them on there again,
tried to do three spirals.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.150 align:middle line:10%
1, 2, 3.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.672 align:middle line:10%
They were all
positive orientated

00:22:52.672 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:10%
where the positive
magnets were on there.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:55.920 align:middle line:10%
Tried to put them
in the next one.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:10%
Didn't work.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So after numerous
trial and errors,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I found that if they
were in the pattern--

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
again, I had lost
sight that there

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:90%
is a pattern in the universe.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.610 align:middle line:10%
In one of Dr. Norman's
books, he talks

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:10%
about how NASA
transposed or found

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.200 align:middle line:10%
that there are arms of energy
that come off the sun--

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.420 align:middle line:10%
positive, negative,
positive, negative.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:84%
There's four arms
when you really

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:84%
delve into it, the same
that Fibonacci spiral.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:90%
So I took that idea--

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:84%
positive, negative,
positive, negative--

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:90%
on those two cones, and voila.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:90%
I got spin.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I got two of them to spin.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.310 align:middle line:10%
So once I figured
that, it delved

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:45.270 align:middle line:10%
me deeper than I felt that I
was on a track of something,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:49.140 align:middle line:10%
that magnetism could be shaped.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.350 align:middle line:10%
And right now, we
see in our own ideas

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:54.840 align:middle line:10%
of what school teaches you--

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.700 align:middle line:10%
there's another
guy, Howard Johnson.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't know how many of
you have ever heard of him.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:10%
He brought out a theory that
there's a double polarity

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.370 align:middle line:10%
vortex in a magnet.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.310 align:middle line:10%
I 100% believe he was right.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:10%
We do not know that
today in our schooling.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:10%
He's kind of a lost treasure.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:10%
He passed away, I think,
in like 2008 or something.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:10%
But he stated that there was
a vortex within the magnet.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:10%
There's not much
writings about him,

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:10%
but he did map the
magnetic fields.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:10%
That helped me so much because
once I theorized and said,

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:10%
somebody else has got
to find the same thing,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.030 align:middle line:10%
he was one that helped me
find that similar idea.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:10%
There is that force,
again, bringing out

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:10%
this whole idea of the vortex.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:42.990 align:middle line:10%
We can't miss it.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:10%
It's right in front of us.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:49.038 align:middle line:10%
So electricity brings
us to the Tesla coils.

00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:50.580 align:middle line:10%
So at the moment,
I think everybody's

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.460 align:middle line:10%
been trying to say, OK, so
what really is going on?

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:90%
So to bring it down--

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and I must step off here
just so you could see.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what I developed
over the course of time.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:90%
I had two of these that were--

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:84%
two cones that I put
the magnets around.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.658 align:middle line:84%
Now, I finally got
those two to work.

00:25:09.658 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
I figured that, well,
heck, if two can work, then

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:90%
I can do four.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So I made all four of
them exactly the same,

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
not realizing there's
another pattern.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to the
idea of the sunflower,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
there's a clockwise
spiral, and there's

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:90%
a counterclockwise spiral.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Oh, why didn't I know that
from the beginning where

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I spent so much time trying
to get the thing to work,

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:90%
not realizing--

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.130 align:middle line:90%
follow the pattern.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So once I followed the pattern,
I got the four to work,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:42.090 align:middle line:84%
not realizing, oh, you
can get six to work.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it with
a mechanical gear,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:84%
but you can do it
with a magnetic field.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So to run this-- let me shut
this off so you kind of see

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:90%
some of the ideas.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of a
spin, a run up--

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
right now, we're
taking electricity.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.590 align:middle line:90%
[MACHINE WHIRRING]

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It has a pulse coil
that drives magnets.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So everybody knows
that a positive field

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:90%
and a positive field repel.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:14.130 align:middle line:84%
A positive field and a
negative field attract.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So on using those ideas,
I have positive coils

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:84%
pushing the vortex at
the top, driving them

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
at a consistent pattern of--

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.370 align:middle line:84%
there's a little
electronic eye that

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:33.760 align:middle line:84%
tells when that coil
should turn on and off.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So by seeing that,
I found that I

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.960 align:middle line:84%
could turn those two coils
on and drive the four

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.600 align:middle line:90%
outer coils--

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.890 align:middle line:90%
combs, I should say.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.730 align:middle line:84%
So let me shut this down just
for another moment because--

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:90%
the motor's off.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It's running on a
12-volt battery.

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not a perpetual
motion machine.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a theory of what
could be possible.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.555 align:middle line:84%
So when I started falling down
the rabbit trail of saying,

00:27:01.555 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:90%
oh, there's something here.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
There's something going
on, I have a theory now

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
that leads me to the next stage.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.600 align:middle line:90%
This worked, OK?

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So by building the motor, I
now have a motor generator.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.240 align:middle line:84%
The outer coils that are
around this are the generator,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and in a moment, I'll show
there's enough electricity

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:84%
to run this Tesla coil, which
then you can kind of see

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.720 align:middle line:90%
some of Tesla's ideas.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.400 align:middle line:84%
We have a single
wire with no return.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:90%
So this comes out.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
In the Wardenclyffe Tower,
he had taken that tower,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.170 align:middle line:90%
grounded it to the Earth.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
If you look in some
of his drawings,

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:84%
he did other experiments
other than just grounding it.

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So I followed that experiment,
kind of reversed it back,

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.410 align:middle line:84%
took a single wire off the base,
which normally goes to ground.

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And so he theorized that on
another part of the planet,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.370 align:middle line:84%
you could dip a ground
rod into the ground,

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:56.020 align:middle line:90%
which this is my ground.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And you could have
electricity run.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.270 align:middle line:84%
This is a single
wire, no return, OK?

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
In our electrical
grid right now, we

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:84%
have a common, a
hot, and a ground.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:10%
So one goes out,
and one comes back.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:10%
Supposedly, the load is
somewhere in between.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.340 align:middle line:10%
So we have processes
of where we're

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:10%
trapped in our electrical
grid because we

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.062 align:middle line:10%
have fires that happen
because the wires spark

00:28:23.062 --> 00:28:24.270 align:middle line:10%
and all these type of things.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, if we were to do
something and use a ground

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.090 align:middle line:10%
current and/or take it
to an even higher level

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:10%
of understanding-- is to take
what comes off as a Tesla coil,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:10%
turn it into a laser
or a beam of light,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:10%
run that to another demodulating
step-down transformer.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:43.980 align:middle line:90%
You now have no wires.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Wind can blow all it wants.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't even matter.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:10%
But you're transferring it
through the ether of space,

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:10%
which they have cast out and
said, the ether does not exist.

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Supposedly, it's not there.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.990 align:middle line:90%
We live in a sea of energy.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.835 align:middle line:84%
There is a medium
between you and I.

00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:10%
It has to be there for
the vibration of my voice

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.090 align:middle line:10%
to travel along a wavelength
of energy so in your earlobes,

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:11.020 align:middle line:10%
you can pick that up.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:15.550 align:middle line:10%
We've developed that process
to say, OK, now I can hear you,

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:10%
but not realizing the
principle or the physics

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.420 align:middle line:10%
that goes behind that.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.860 align:middle line:90%
It's deep.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
We're moving that energy.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what evolution
has taught us.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So let me turn this
back on, run it up.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
The theory that-- and the thing
that I found in the course

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:90%
of this in--

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:84%
let's bring it to what's
going on in today's world--

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
is we're at a process to where
if we don't use electricity,

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:90%
it's lost.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.230 align:middle line:90%
They generate it.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:84%
You either have to
store it or use it

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.850 align:middle line:84%
because if you
don't store it, you

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.740 align:middle line:84%
can't use it at a
later time because it's

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.800 align:middle line:84%
an instantaneous motion of that
movement of that electron, OK?

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.490 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
develop flywheel systems.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.460 align:middle line:84%
In my research of
flywheels, what I found

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:90%
is that this is my flywheel.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Flywheels have a problem.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like a gyroscope, where
once they're up and running--

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
everybody has felt a gyroscope.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't turn it because
it always wants to stand up.

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, I found in this system
that you can take this and turn

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.080 align:middle line:90%
it on any axis that you want.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It cancels out the
gyroscopic effect.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.080 align:middle line:84%
You can now put a flywheel
on a moving platform,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter.

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Before, trying to put a flywheel
on a car, if you want to turn

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.090 align:middle line:84%
left, it always wants to
go right because you're

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.620 align:middle line:90%
trying to stand up.

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Those are the forces
of nature that we are

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:58.250 align:middle line:90%
needing to learn to understand.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The gyroscopic,
gravitational pulls,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:04.250 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call it,
is really the centrifugal force

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.290 align:middle line:90%
of the influx of that vortex.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have the
centripetal, which

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
is the out-kick of that vortex.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:13.020 align:middle line:10%
There's your vortex
idea once again.

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:10%
So now that the
system's running,

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:10%
there's enough power that's
generated from the magnets that

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.420 align:middle line:10%
are going by the coils.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:10%
Gives me close to 110 coming
out of those coils, which

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:10%
is now running into this Tesla
coil, which is a transformer.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:10%
It's taking that electricity
and stepping it up

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.260 align:middle line:10%
to high voltage, high
frequency, low amperage.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.310 align:middle line:84%
When I turn on the switch,
you can see over here

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.450 align:middle line:84%
on the far end, single
wire with no return lights

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:50.050 align:middle line:90%
the motor, turns on this system.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also see,
this one got bumped on the way

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.478 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:31:55.478 --> 00:31:56.520 align:middle line:90%
We have a wireless light.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So what it states is that I
have now energized the field.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called the "near field,"
which is in electronics.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's a certain point
that this is radiant, too.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's the reality of
what Tesla was trying to do.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.250 align:middle line:84%
So you notice when I
move this out of there,

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:84%
this was the slave that
was drawing the energy.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:24.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a principle-- they'll
probably shut it off.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've got to
become in resonance.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:10%
So everything has
to be in resonance.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:middle line:10%
This is part of what I
learned and developed

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.270 align:middle line:10%
over many, many hours of
trying to get this to run.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:37.860 align:middle line:84%
The Tesla coils that I've
seen that are around--

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:84%
so it shows that the single
wire is electric everywhere.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So in a small experiment
in my garage, what I found

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:84%
is that you could charge a cell
phone walking around with this.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:10%
But what you have to do is
you've got to be able to put

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.700 align:middle line:10%
the design of this coil
small enough, down small--

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:10%
it fits in there--

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:10%
so you have a multiple
sender, whether it's

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.870 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of
a room somewhere

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:10%
in the center of your
house like a chimney.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Wrap your house
with a single wire,

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might need to
be, some conceptual idea.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.360 align:middle line:84%
You could walk around anywhere
and have a wireless light

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and dial it with a
potentiometer, wherever

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.170 align:middle line:90%
it might be.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
having to plug in.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that what we want to do?

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.750 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that free energy?

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:24.800 align:middle line:10%
It's an idea.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.910 align:middle line:10%
This was some, on a
small, small, small scale,

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:33.320 align:middle line:10%
of what I conceptualize of
what Tesla was trying to do.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:90%
So where am I going with this?

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.327 align:middle line:10%
Why do I even have
a passion about it?

00:33:39.327 --> 00:33:40.160 align:middle line:10%
What does it matter?

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.740 align:middle line:10%
Will it ever go anywhere else?

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, last year I was
issued a patent on the gear.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.070 align:middle line:90%
So it has multiple uses.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.280 align:middle line:84%
If you think about in
medicine right now,

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.350 align:middle line:84%
we have a situation
where you have a disease,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and you don't want something
else to catch the disease.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.270 align:middle line:90%
So you have to separate it, OK?

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, you have to have
a centrifuge that turns,

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.590 align:middle line:84%
but you don't want
somebody interact with it.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So with magnets, you
can move something

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.000 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of a wall
just by the oscillation.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.929 align:middle line:84%
So you could turn a centrifuge
on another side of the wall,

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:90%
isolate something.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:20.960 align:middle line:84%
That's a process of another
principle of isolation,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:84%
selectivity, which are
all of the elements

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:90%
that you have to have.

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:27.800 align:middle line:90%
These coils are somewhat--

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a scope
or all the things

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.179 align:middle line:84%
that the electronic
engineers have.

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.570 align:middle line:84%
If this was done with
proper instrumentation

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.290 align:middle line:84%
where everything was
precision, wound,

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:40.940 align:middle line:84%
set up, and done
correctly, I can

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.330 align:middle line:84%
imagine the efficiency you might
be able to get out of this.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm just an experimenter,
but I found some things

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.429 align:middle line:84%
that I thought, wow, this is
pretty interesting for a garage

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:53.409 align:middle line:90%
explorer.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Finding it on
YouTube, I have yet

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.050 align:middle line:84%
to find other people
who are running motors

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:90%
off a Tesla coil.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:01.010 align:middle line:10%
I see a lot of lightning
coming off of them,

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:10%
but you gotta look really
deep in Tesla's research

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.280 align:middle line:10%
of his Colorado Springs
notes where he says,

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.880 align:middle line:10%
that is an ill effect
that I don't want.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.520 align:middle line:90%
So once I understood that--

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and I closed down the gap,
which this is up in front.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.130 align:middle line:10%
It's a gap that the spark jumps
across through the capacitor

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and how it's all
set up through--

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:23.300 align:middle line:10%
those that are into
understanding how that works

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:10%
is a resonant tank circuit.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.200 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, I closed that off.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.840 align:middle line:84%
He's stated that if you
really want to build a system,

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.560 align:middle line:84%
you have to be
inclusive of the load.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.430 align:middle line:90%
That's my load.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So I tuned the gap
to what my load

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is because when I open that
gap, these things won't work

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.780 align:middle line:90%
because it sparks too much.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I lose my potential out
the top of the Tesla coil.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many
people have found that,

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's something that
I discovered on my own

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:58.130 align:middle line:84%
through my own experimentation
and reading and writing.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.101 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So other people,
have you-- anybody

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.580 align:middle line:90%
heard of Walter Russell?

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:17.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you look at this diagram
from 1934, it has that vortex.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Walter Russell met
Tesla, and there's

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
correspondence between
that are archives

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
of the now University of
Science and Philosophy Center.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Walter Russell's
stuff was in storage.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They had some situation happen
and lost a lot of money,

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and the stuff was just
placed in storage.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
There is tonnage of
stuff they have moved,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and they now have a museum.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And from that museum, they
also found some other things.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.740 align:middle line:10%
There's an optical
dynamo generator

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.050 align:middle line:10%
that he had worked on that was
based upon building coils that

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.630 align:middle line:10%
were in a vortex.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Supposedly, there's a--

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.420 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it was Raytheon
or one of the big high-tech

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:10%
companies at that time--

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.750 align:middle line:10%
picked up on the idea.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:10%
Never know if it
went anywhere or not.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The blueprints to creation--
the cube and the sphere

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.710 align:middle line:84%
are the sole working
tools of creation.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:10%
When you get down to
what's going on in crystals

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:19.000 align:middle line:10%
and other elements, they flow
into that vortex, which creates

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.490 align:middle line:10%
a pattern of a crystal, OK?

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:10%
To me, in another theory
that I was working on,

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.020 align:middle line:10%
is that if you have
a magnet in your hand

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:10%
and you take it apart, so
to say, reverse engineer it,

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:36.720 align:middle line:10%
what does it look like?

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:90%
That.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.110 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I've shaped the field as
a spiral inside a spiral

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:90%
into a vortex.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.910 align:middle line:10%
That is what we
don't see or what

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:10%
we do see in science because
they map it with a compass,

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.820 align:middle line:10%
and it shows that there are
field lines that go around.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a dead
zone in the middle,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:84%
not realizing that that
dead zone actually comes

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to the center, comes down to
the bottom, back up to the top,

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and around, not necessarily
just a figure eight,

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:10.440 align:middle line:90%
but like the clover design, OK?

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So that clover design
was the discovery.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.193 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there is
that pattern of energy.

00:38:18.193 --> 00:38:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I was trying with
another friend of mine

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to make a fidget spanner so I
could have them here and maybe

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
sell them to people,
but it's really hard

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody manufacture
something for you.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So you could all have one and
buy one and take one home.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.270 align:middle line:90%
That was kind of the idea.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
It was too much to try
to make it come together.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But the discovery led me
to the spiral-beveled gear,

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.920 align:middle line:84%
and like I say, the canceling
of gyroscopic forces.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.140 align:middle line:90%
This could be used.

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.720 align:middle line:10%
This is really what
this looks like.

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:51.510 align:middle line:10%
So you have this vortex and this
vortex, and on each of those,

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:54.390 align:middle line:10%
there are four spirals.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.390 align:middle line:84%
There's a positive and
a negative running up

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that vortex, and
in that, there's

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:04.260 align:middle line:84%
also a clockwise spiral and
a counterclockwise spiral.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And they all have to
synchronize where it

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.890 align:middle line:90%
becomes one movement of energy.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.740 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Last year, I was awarded
a patent on the design

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and the process of it.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.410 align:middle line:10%
So it brought it to the reality
that some of the theories

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:10%
that I were thinking about--

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.220 align:middle line:10%
it was new and novel that
something had never been done.

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So it made sense, and it proved
the theory of the reality

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that there is a regeneration
of the magnetic field

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and electric field.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.340 align:middle line:90%
At least, it did to me.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It talked to me in my own head
of saying, I'm on the trail.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.730 align:middle line:10%
So here, it just brings out--

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:10%
I've had this idea of the
Magnevex research project.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:53.550 align:middle line:10%
The Magnevex stands for the
magnetic electric vortex.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.980 align:middle line:10%
I think that will be
the key to unlocking

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.340 align:middle line:10%
the idea of free energy or
moving us into the future

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.938 align:middle line:10%
because the
principle-- and that's

00:40:00.938 --> 00:40:01.980 align:middle line:10%
what I want to bring out.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.290 align:middle line:10%
It's the principle of
how these things function

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:08.430 align:middle line:10%
in nature that could
be adapted to multitude

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.640 align:middle line:10%
arenas inside the
kingdom, not necessarily

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:10%
just for a generator or
electricity and that type

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:16.570 align:middle line:10%
of stuff.

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:20.490 align:middle line:84%
But it could be applied to
how we do things in society,

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.150 align:middle line:84%
even the movement of how
our financial systems work.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:90%
You have to have the yin.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.970 align:middle line:90%
You have to have the yang.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to have the exchange
and the polarity balance

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.370 align:middle line:90%
across that fulcrum.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Without that, it won't work,
and that's what we're seeing.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.030 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be
the conceptualization

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:42.420 align:middle line:84%
of that information,
not just on one facet,

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.750 align:middle line:84%
because it's a multifaceted
process that we're involved in.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Our food systems are
rapidly decaying.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.710 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to do it
with genetic engineering.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.490 align:middle line:10%
Could be some good
things to that,

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.360 align:middle line:10%
but if it's done along the
lines of the process of what

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:01.830 align:middle line:10%
Mother Nature is building as
and we use that as an example,

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:05.730 align:middle line:10%
that's the whole concept
of this idea here today.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Take what Mother
Nature has and try

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:84%
to take from that
information that is

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.990 align:middle line:90%
available to be seen by anyone.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:17.010 align:middle line:10%
Just go walk outside into the
forest and see what's going on.

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.600 align:middle line:10%
Be observant of
that information.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Say, what if, and how can I?

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm not schooled in
any of this, so it

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:10%
shows that any one
of you with an idea

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:31.860 align:middle line:10%
and a spark, if you pursue
it, you can find that dream.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.540 align:middle line:10%
Hopefully, this was
inspiring for you.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:10%
I know it was a long time to
hang out and wait onto a Sunday

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.930 align:middle line:10%
evening.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, hopefully it
was enlightening

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.190 align:middle line:10%
that there are things that are
out there that people theorized

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.990 align:middle line:10%
on.

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I tried to do on a small scale
a little proof of concept

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:51.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
wireless electricity,

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and Mother Nature is the
inherent design inspiration

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.481 align:middle line:90%
that we can live and build from.

00:41:59.481 --> 00:42:00.281 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:03.510 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:04.530 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:05.330 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:90%
