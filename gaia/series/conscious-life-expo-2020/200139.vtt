00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Conscious Life Expo 2020
welcomes Mr. Scott Wolter.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jimmy.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.500 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, now that we've get that
out of the way, thank you,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:90%
Jimmy.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:10%
I really appreciate it.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.420 align:middle line:10%
And I want to thank all
of you for coming today.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.890 align:middle line:10%
This is a-- this is a thrill.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:10%
I've never been to
this conference before,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.420 align:middle line:10%
but I'm having a blast,
except it's wearing me out.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:90%
There's just so much going on.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, today what
I'd like to do--

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and I want to keep
this an open exchange.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.985 align:middle line:84%
If you have a burning
question about something,

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
just raise your hand.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll take care of it then, OK?

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to start
off today with a question.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I want everybody
to be honest, OK?

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Raise your hand if
you know the origin

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:90%
of the five-pointed star.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Besides you.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Do you know the origin of this
symbol, which is basically

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of our nation?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
All of us pledge
allegiance to 50 of them

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that are on our flag, right?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what you're
pledging allegiance to?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.712 align:middle line:84%
But the origins you're
not clear on, OK?

00:01:25.712 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I have to be honest
with you and tell you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that I find that incredible,
for that very reason that it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of our nation.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And that symbol appears on
the flag of many nations

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:90%
So what is that origin?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, that origin has to
do with the third brightest

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.160 align:middle line:90%
heavenly body in the sky.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
that is, right?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.540 align:middle line:90%
The sun, moon, and Venus.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And right now, Venus
is so beautiful.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
She's in the Western
sky right now.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Right as the sun sets, she's
high in the sky, about--

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't know-- 30 degrees.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.010 align:middle line:90%
And then she'll slowly set.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice how
I'm saying she?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Do you know why I'm saying that?

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
You're going to.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So-- and this is something
that's been going on

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.780 align:middle line:90%
for millennia, OK?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
Cultures around
the world have been

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:84%
tracking the movement
of this important, very

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:90%
accurate heavenly body.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
So as we view its movements
from Earth astronomically

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
over eight earth years, it will
make the five-pointed star.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.890 align:middle line:84%
How many people remember the
spirograph when we were kids?

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
You know how you spin
it around and make

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:90%
those beautiful shapes?

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
That's basically
what happens, but it

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
makes that five-pointed star.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:90%
OK, big deal.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:90%
That's cool, right?

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:84%
The reason that's
important is because, if we

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
take this symbol inside
of the five-pointed star,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:90%
that's a what?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:90%
A pentagram, pentagon.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:90%
This symbol is the pentragram.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:90%
But this is a pentagon.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we assign a value
of 1 to this distance

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:84%
on any one of
these five lengths,

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.020 align:middle line:84%
this distance relative
to that distance

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.130 align:middle line:84%
is 1 to 1.618 something,
something, something.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:84%
That is something
called the golden ratio.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It is the key to
life in the universe.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.780 align:middle line:84%
This ratio is the rate of
growth of a spiral on a shell.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the rate of
growth of plants.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the rate of growth
of a breaking wave.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm one ahead here.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:90%
It is also inside of all of us.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
This ratio is
throughout our bodies.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It is also throughout
the universe.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:84%
You know when you're looking
at a satellite photo like this?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:84%
That spiral is in
our atmosphere.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
It is also when you
brush your teeth

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and you see the water
go down the drain.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:90%
It's also the shape of a galaxy.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So it is the key to
life in the universe.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's amazing, right?

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So what is creation and
life associated with?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.839 align:middle line:90%
You guys, the feminine, right?

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:90%
Women are the life givers.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:84%
That is why we call her she,
because the Fibonacci sequence

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.150 align:middle line:90%
is in the planet Venus.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's why.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have the goddess in
the heavens with Venus.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.452 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
moon goddess, right?

00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing
I think I should

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.880 align:middle line:84%
tell you is that when
you round the Fibonacci

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.060 align:middle line:84%
sequence to whole value numbers,
basically the way it works

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:90%
is like this.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
1 plus 1 is 2, and then you
add the previous high number

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to your sum, and then
you get the next number.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:90%
So 1 plus 1 is 2, 2 plus 1 is--

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:90%
3 plus 2 is--

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:90%
5 plus 3 is--

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:90%
8 plus 5 is--

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.850 align:middle line:90%
13, hm.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:90%
So here's a question for you.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
If it takes eight Earth years
to make the five-pointed star,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990 align:middle line:84%
tracking it from Earth
over eight years,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
how many Venus years does it
take to do the same thing?

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, Earth
is here, Venus is here,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:20.730 align:middle line:90%
the sun is here, right?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's an inner orbit
relative to where Earth is.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:90%
So it's moving faster.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:90%
So the year is shorter.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
So how many years do
you think it takes?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:90%
13, OK?

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So 8 and 13 is the
Fibonacci sequence.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
There it is in
the heavens again.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the point is that
the number 13 is associated

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:90%
with the feminine, right?

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And for all those years when
we grew up, 13 was what?

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Bad luck number.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.310 align:middle line:84%
Because of the suppression
of the feminine, OK?

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
When in reality,
it's a good thing.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:90%
And so things are changing.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And the elevation
of the feminine

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is happening right
now, as it should,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:84%
as it must if we are
going to achieve balance.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk more
about that balance.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, isn't this
kind of cool stuff?

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's the coolest thing ever.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So the most iconic symbol of
our nation is about the goddess,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think
Jerry Jones would say

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.925 align:middle line:90%
if he heard what I just said?

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:84%
You going to change your
name to your football team

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
to the Dallas Goddesses?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.795 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be awesome?

00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to happen.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, so I just thought
I'd throw that out there.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
So the Kensington Rune Stone
is what started my journey.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've been on this
journey now for 20 years.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And just so you know, I'm
a geologist by education

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:90%
and thankfully by profession.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I run a materials forensic
laboratory in Minneapolis.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I basically do autopsies
on concrete and rock.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And I spend most
of my time working

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
on problems in the construction
field, which is really boring,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:90%
but it is important.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Probably the thing
that I'll be remembered

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
for more than anything is the
work we did at the Pentagon

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:84%
after 9/11, evaluating all the
fire damage to structural beams

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and columns.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was one of the
most amazing things

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:90%
I've ever worked on.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.290 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, that was
nothing compared to the day

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that I was contacted
and said, would you--

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
we'd like you to study
the Kensington Rune Stone.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what's that?

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The Kensington Rune Stone
was found in Minnesota.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And people were like, you
don't know what that is?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.253 align:middle line:90%
I said, I don't know what it is.

00:07:35.253 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
I must've missed school
that day or something,

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.962 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they tried
to tell me the story.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And I could see right away
that the person representing

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
the museum where this
artifact is housed

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
was clearly an advocate
for authenticity.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And I gave him a speech.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, I'll be happy
to do this work for you,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
but you need to understand,
when I get done,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
I may come back and give you
news you're not going to like.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're still
going to pay me, OK?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful thing.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:90%
When I do my work--

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm an independent--
I get paid either way.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Any lawyers in the room?

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
You guys know what
I'm talking about.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.037 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, that's how it started.

00:08:14.037 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, I'm
just going to do this.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
If you're OK with
that, let's go.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.780 align:middle line:90%
And off we went.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Kensington Rune
Stone was found in Minnesota

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
in a sleepy little
town called Kensington.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:10%
And it is sleepy.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.880 align:middle line:10%
It basically has
a train station.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.297 align:middle line:10%
It's got a hardware store,
a grocery store, and a bar.

00:08:31.297 --> 00:08:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not kidding.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's tiny.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's 15 miles
west of Alexandria,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.430 align:middle line:84%
about two hours
drive from my house.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And in the fall of 1898,
this guy right here standing

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:84%
in the middle, Olof Ohman,
a Swedish immigrant,

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
was clearing trees in
preparation for farming.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
He was homesteading
the property.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And working with two of--

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
at that spot right there,
working with his two oldest

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.940 align:middle line:84%
sons-- this is a painting that
I had commissioned to illustrate

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.615 align:middle line:90%
the moment of discovery.

00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And what he did is
he cut off the roots

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
around the base of the
tree, he took a winch,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:90%
he tipped the tree over.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.340 align:middle line:84%
This was real smart, because
it pulled the stump up with it,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.598 align:middle line:84%
I would have cut the tree off
and spent the next three days

00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:15.600 align:middle line:84%
digging out the stump, but
these guys were pretty smart.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
But as the tree fell,
the roots were still

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:90%
wrapped around the stone.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled it
out of the ground.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
younger son, Edward,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
who's pointing to the stone
that first noticed there

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.150 align:middle line:90%
was something carved on it.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out it was
a long inscription carved

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:90%
in Scandinavian runes.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the
inscription right here.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to read it
to you, because there

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
is a discovery that
I made recently

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that is pretty profound, at
least in my opinion, that

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the inscription.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And I want you just
to hear it once, OK?

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
8 Gotlanders and 22
north men, 8 and 22 north

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.270 align:middle line:84%
men on this acquisition
journey/taking up land.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Can that be any more obvious?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a land claim, right?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.920 align:middle line:90%
From Vinland far to the west.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We had a camp near two shelters,
one day's journey north

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
from the stone from this spot
right here where this rock is.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.470 align:middle line:84%
After we-- we were
fishing one day.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.210 align:middle line:84%
After we came home, found 10
men red from blood and death.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Then we have three
Latin letters,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
which is pretty unusual for
a medieval Scandinavian rune

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:90%
stone--

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:90%
AVM.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.090 align:middle line:90%
AVM, what does that mean?

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, depending on
your point of view,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:84%
it might mean a prayer for
the Virgin Mary, right?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.890 align:middle line:84%
To other people, it might
be a different Mary.

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And then saved from evil, on
the split side of the stone,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:84%
on the side, it says there
are 10 men by the inland sea

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
to look after our ships 14 days'
journey from this island, year

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
1362.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're a
historian, you know

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that 1362 is 130 years
after Chris Columbus.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You know that guy
that didn't set foot

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.800 align:middle line:84%
on the continent, that
already had millions of people

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:90%
live in here?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:90%
That guy?

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so-- so I
wrote my report.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.790 align:middle line:90%
I did a-- well, wait a sec.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the picture
I have to show you.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.440 align:middle line:90%
See what this stone did to me?

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.370 align:middle line:90%
I used to have dark hair.

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, so I did the analysis.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And what I did was I--

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
they wanted me to
try to figure out

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the relative age
of the inscription.

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was I
went to the east coast

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
to find tombstones
that were old enough.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I compared the weathering
of those tombstones--

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I took a small chip
samples, with permission,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
because one of my
professors got mad at me.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.870 align:middle line:84%
He says, you can't go
banging on tombstones.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, I had permission.

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
If I'm dead laying
there and there's

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
a guy coming here to try to
solve a question, take whatever

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.180 align:middle line:90%
you want, right?

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.323 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so I did the
weathering, and I compared it.

00:12:03.323 --> 00:12:04.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
into too much detail,

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
because I want to
get to the fun stuff.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what
I concluded was that,

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
by taking samples from
the side of the stone

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:90%
not in the inscription--

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't damage the inscription,
a very small chip sample.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.320 align:middle line:10%
And basically, I concluded
that the weathering

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.470 align:middle line:10%
of the inscription was
older than 200 years,

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:10%
based on comparing
the weathering

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.070 align:middle line:10%
of the tombstones, right?

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.600 align:middle line:10%
And that was from 1898, not
when I did the experiment,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:10%
because it hasn't been in a
weathering environments since.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
So that pushes it back 200
years at least, past Olof Ohman.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was the
one that everybody

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:90%
accused of carving it.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So guess what?

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't have done it.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And logic says it's either
a late 19th century hoax,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:90%
or it's not, right?

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:90%
That's all you've got.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it isn't a
hoax, it must be real.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wrote in my
report, and I published it.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
trouble started.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God, I'm not even kidding.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:84%
It was so bad-- the personal
insults, the attacks.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And you know what was--

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and understand something, OK?

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, if
I write a paper,

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I write a report, if I
made a mistake, tell me.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I need to know, and I will fix
it, because I'm not perfect.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.860 align:middle line:90%
Hell no.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
what it was about.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make a mistake.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
They just didn't
like the answer.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, tough hop.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Life doesn't always
go your way, right?

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I am
with all my findings.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.878 align:middle line:84%
I put people out of business
with the test results

00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
based on a failure that might
have happened on a construction

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:90%
project.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.880 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, you know, I'm
OK with taking criticism

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:90%
if it's legitimate.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:90%
If it's not, then it's on.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I just made my
mind, up and I said, OK,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:90%
why aren't they accepting this?

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought they'd be happy,
for crying out loud.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So then what I
did is I said, I'm

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:58.120 align:middle line:84%
going to get to
the bottom of this.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:90%
So I went to Sweden five times.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out--

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.660 align:middle line:90%
here's another thing.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
If this is a genuine
artifact, which it is,

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
you know what that also
means that logic demands?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:90%
That somebody carved it, right?

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
They came from some
place for some reason.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I've been working on

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.970 align:middle line:90%
for the last 20 years.

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think I have
it figured out.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So in any scientific
investigation,

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what
you're investigating.

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's concrete, or
aliens, or rune stones,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.540 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:90%
The process is the same.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Facts first, interpretations,
and then maybe you

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
might be able to draw
a conclusion, maybe.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, I
followed the facts.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
I absolutely wanted to learn

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:90%
was about the runes--

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
the dialect, the
grammar, the dating,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:84%
everything that
was on that stone.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And I know enough to
be extremely dangerous.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a runologist.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't pretend to be something
I'm not, but I learned a lot.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And the funny part is it's
such an obscure science.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Honest to God, walking
on the planet today,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably one of
the top three or four

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
people that understand this
period of runes and dialect

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.083 align:middle line:90%
and grammar and all of that.

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%
But the bottom line is this.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:84%
The evidence took me to
Sweden, to this large island

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.940 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the Baltic
Sea, where there were

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:27.120 align:middle line:90%
99 churches on this island.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I went to every one.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm anal retentive.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm a lab guy.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I just had to go to every one,
because the one I don't go to,

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that's the one that had
the best stuff, right?

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So anyway-- and
remember this, too.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.350 align:middle line:84%
The only person in the 14th
century that could possibly

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
have carved an inscription
of this complexity and length

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
had to be a member
of the clergy, right?

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the common people
weren't educated by design.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
The church is going to tell you
what the Bible says, and so on.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So I knew it had to be
a member of the clergy.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And we found all
the evidence here

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.440 align:middle line:84%
on these grave slabs
at these churches.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And so who were the
clergy that were there?

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.102 align:middle line:90%
They were these White Monks.

00:16:09.102 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know
anything about monks.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.360 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding?

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the word monastery
probably never came out

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:90%
of my mouth up until that time.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
But now, I'm an expert on them.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The White Monks,
the Cistercians,

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.590 align:middle line:84%
who were founded in
1098 by Robert Molesme.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
They had one abbey
at Citeaux, France.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then in 1113, this guy,
St. Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:84%
joined the order with
30 family members.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
That particular event was the
greatest coup d'etat in history

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that nobody talks about, because
they basically took it over.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he joined the order
with two of his uncles.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:84%
One was a guy named
Hugh de Payens,

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
one of the original nine knights
that went to the Holy Land.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
our story takes off.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.710 align:middle line:84%
But St. Bernard de
Clairvaux, I could tell you

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stories about him.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
He had a fascination
with the Virgin Mary,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.170 align:middle line:84%
to the point where the pope was
like, dude, we like her, too,

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
but you might want to
dial back a little bit.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:90%
In fact, his miracle--

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
his miracle, if
you look at him--

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and the most common
image of Bernard--

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and there are thousands
of images of Bernard.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
He was preaching one
day to the monks.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
And there was a statue of
the Virgin Mary behind him.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And he turned around,
and her exposed

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
breasts started dripping
milk into his mouth.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.380 align:middle line:90%
No, that's his miracle.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows about this.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.810 align:middle line:90%
This guy is amazing.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You guys ever do this-- if
you're at a dinner party

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.253 align:middle line:84%
some time with a
bunch of people,

00:17:42.253 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:84%
you don't know what you
want to break the ice,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:90%
here's a fun game.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Just go around the
table and ask people,

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
if you could meet anybody
in history-- alive or dead--

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.150 align:middle line:90%
who would it be?

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:90%
And what would you ask them?

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:90%
And they would have to answer.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.525 align:middle line:84%
And then you go
around the table,

00:17:56.525 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and you will get
some amazing answers.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And you will learn something
about those people, even people

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that you thought you
knew, that's really cool.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you know
my guy would be?

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.020 align:middle line:90%
Him, right there.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he joined
the order, and he

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.360 align:middle line:84%
founded Clairvaux, the second--
the first Daughter Abbey,

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
the second Abbey
of the Cistercians.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And by the time he died in 1153,
there were over 300 abbeys all

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.110 align:middle line:84%
across Europe, going into
Scandinavia toward the Holy

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Land.

00:18:24.910 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, at the time with
the put-down of the Templars,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
there were over 750, the most
successful monastic order

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.515 align:middle line:90%
And it isn't even close.

00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing a
lot of people don't know

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
is that St. Bernard, in
1128, wrote the charter

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.180 align:middle line:90%
for the Knights Templar Order.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what I learned
when I did this research.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, I'm doing
investigation about stuff

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing about.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I followed the evidence
trail, and it took me

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.930 align:middle line:90%
to the Templars and nobody else.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.395 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
easiest evidence trail

00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I think I've ever followed.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It's like people go,
oh, the Templars,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:90%
isn't that convenient?

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:90%
Oh, "Da Vinci Code," all that.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I go, shut up, I follow the
evidence, that's where it goes.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I hate that nonsense.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:84%
In any case, here's
a big secret I'm

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
about to reveal
about the Templars.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
They understood all the
sacred geometry, astronomy,

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:90%
the five-pointed star.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And they venerated the goddess.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what I figured out.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you know what to look
for, you will see it yourself.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, their
true ideology was

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:84%
something called monotheistic
dualism, basically

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:90%
venerating a deity, right?

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.930 align:middle line:10%
A single deity that had
dualistic aspects, the concept

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:10%
of opposites, dualism--

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.372 align:middle line:10%
like male/female,
heaven and Earth,

00:19:38.372 --> 00:19:40.330 align:middle line:10%
good/bad, light/dark,
yin/yang, all that stuff.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:10%
You guys know all
this stuff, right?

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:10%
They keep things in balance.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's right here.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the 14th century parchment.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
Virgin Mary, right?

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:90%
The goddess.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And she's protecting the nuns
and the monks equally, right?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
There's your dualism right
there in the 14th century.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't believe me,
look at the evidence.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And so as I did this
investigation, everything

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
on Gotland we found-- the
language, runes, dialect,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.110 align:middle line:84%
grammar, all that
stuff was there.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
There was one thing
that was missing,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that, the hooked X, which is
being used for the A sound,

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or the letter A all
throughout the inscription.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.630 align:middle line:90%
It occurs-- get this--

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:90%
22 times.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Is that a coincidence?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:10%
Psh, none of this is
coincidence, trust me.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this is not the
symbol, the Scandinavian rune,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.410 align:middle line:90%
for that A sound.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
confounded the scholars.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
They're like, what the
heck is this thing?

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.685 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what this is.

00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we don't know.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.130 align:middle line:90%
It must be a fake.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the dumbest logic
I've ever heard in my life.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:90%
How about this?

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.950 align:middle line:84%
How about admit that
you don't know, right?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid to do it.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But I'll admit I don't know, but
I'll damn well figure it out.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so this
is what this was.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going through
this whole journey,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
you've got to remember
I'm a lab guy.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm the guy that--

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been using one side of
my brain, the analytical part.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And this whole spiritual side
it's just-- it wasn't there.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I was forced to
open that side up.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:90%
And here's the symbolism.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.290 align:middle line:84%
This is just one
interpretation of this.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:84%
If you look at an X symbol
and you chop it in half

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:84%
horizontally, OK,
the lower part--

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:90%
the upper part is a V, right?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
Symbolic of the feminine, right?

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:84%
The vessel, the
chalice, the womb.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You flip it over, you have the
sword, the phallic, the penis,

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:90%
the symbol for the male, right?

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And when you combine them
into this symbol, into an X,

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.250 align:middle line:84%
you have the allegorical
union of male/female, heaven

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and Earth, good/bad,
like dualism, right?

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.620 align:middle line:90%
So you all have that, right?

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me ask you this--

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:53.154 align:middle line:90%
what's the hook?

00:21:53.154 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Baby Jesus.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Baby Jesus?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:90%
How about a child, right?

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Think about it like this.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the V is a little girl
inside the womb of her mother.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:90%
And then you've got this.

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people--
or I asked people,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:90%
what's the Holy Trinity?

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.900 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit, right?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.601 align:middle line:90%
What's the Holy Spirit?

00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you know this stuff.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:90%
You stop.

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:84%
No, but what it is basically--
it's not well-defined, right?

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, to me, it's pretty simple,
because, if you look at it,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
you've got the father,
you've got the child.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.380 align:middle line:90%
Who's missing?

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Mama.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Maybe that's the Holy Trinity.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what that
symbolizes, right?

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what it
symbolizes is the essence

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:51.070 align:middle line:90%
of their belief system.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred symbol.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And the scholars
over in Scandinavia

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:84%
are never going to
figure it out until they

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.820 align:middle line:84%
open that side of their
brain that I was forced to,

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.200 align:middle line:90%
because I wanted to know.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And now, I know.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So oh, did this just
start with the Templars?

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:10%
No, it didn't,
because they were just

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:10%
a blip on a long continuum
of bloodline families

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.600 align:middle line:10%
that go all the way back
to Egypt and beyond.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And when you look
at this symbol--

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.610 align:middle line:10%
this is Tutankhamun,
Akhenaten has the same thing.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:26.670 align:middle line:10%
The crook and the flail, right?

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Here's your symbolic
of Osiris, Isis.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And the crook carries
the eggs of fertility.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
There's your
trinity right there.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:84%
So this ideology goes
all the way back.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's around today if
you know where to look.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Another thing as far as
symbolism that I learned

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:84%
is that it's interesting
that this stone was clearly

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.432 align:middle line:84%
split down from a larger
slab of glacial rock.

00:23:51.432 --> 00:23:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly where
this rock came from.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It came from the Thompson
formation up by Duluth

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:90%
in the Thompson Dam.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I mapped these rocks
when I was in college.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.722 align:middle line:84%
When I made the thin
sections and looked at them,

00:24:01.722 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
I saw this two-directional
foliation at 60 degrees.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:90%
I know that rock.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a Minnesota rock.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So whoever came here
found a large slab,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and they split it down, then
they carved the inscription,

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:90%
and buried it as a land claim.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.993 align:middle line:84%
Here's something that's
interesting, though.

00:24:16.993 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a perfect 2 to 1
ratio; and within the 2 to 1

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.760 align:middle line:84%
ratio, what we call in
Freemasonry an oblong square.

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis for all of
sacred geometry right here.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You've got two squares,
two triangles here.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:10%
And it just goes
on and on and on.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:10%
That's a piece of evidence
that I'm the first person

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:10%
to point out.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:38.788 align:middle line:10%
And believe me,
I'm not saying this

00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:40.330 align:middle line:10%
because I think I'm special.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:10%
It's because I knew it was real.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:10%
I trust rocks.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't trust some people.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.470 align:middle line:90%
The rock told me it was real.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So there has to be an
explanation for everything.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.920 align:middle line:90%
And there is.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.720 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to tell
you about the final piece.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to set
this up a little bit,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:03.090 align:middle line:84%
because I understand all the
arguments that the scholars

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:90%
have made against this stone.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But they just don't
make any sense.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line is basically
what they've been trying to do

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:16.340 align:middle line:84%
is tell the Kensington Rune
Stone what it's supposed to be,

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.240 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting the
stone tell them what it is.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I hear these guys talking
about scientific method this.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.320 align:middle line:90%
We did the science.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.350 align:middle line:84%
And they screwed it
up from the get-go,

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
because they did not follow
proper scientific method.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
For one reason is they're
not trained to do it.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.040 align:middle line:90%
So stop talking about it, guys.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Instead of talking, listen.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And I can help you.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.560 align:middle line:90%
But they don't want to.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's one more thing.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
The final piece to the stone
came when I became a Freemason.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to
go into this too much,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:90%
but I will tell you one thing.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Up until I was in my early
50s, I had all the answers.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You guys remember
those days, right?

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.300 align:middle line:90%
We all did.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.490 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until
I got to that point

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that I realized that I
don't know everything.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.360 align:middle line:10%
And you cannot be truly
initiated and enlightened until

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:10%
you take that step within
you and say, you know what?

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.980 align:middle line:10%
I don't know it all.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.200 align:middle line:10%
And then you are
ready to receive,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:10%
truly ready to receive.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And that finally happened
when I was in my 50s.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:10%
So I-- and I just want
to explain briefly.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.563 align:middle line:84%
When you become a
Freemason, you go

00:26:26.563 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
through something called
the Blue Lodge, which

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:90%
is the first three degrees.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, you are
initiated, you are raised,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and you're a brother,
and it's all good.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:84%
You are a Freemason, and
you're done, if you want to be.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:84%
However, if you would like
to seek additional light,

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
there are avenues
that you can pursue.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:84%
One is called the
Scottish Rite, which

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.080 align:middle line:90%
builds off of the Blue Lodge.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's 29
additional degrees.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:10%
And when you start your
Scottish Rite journey,

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:10%
you start at the fourth
degree, and then on you go.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm a 32nd degree.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I've done all those degrees,
and they're amazing.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.750 align:middle line:10%
There's also what we call the
York Rite branch, which again

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.580 align:middle line:10%
builds off of the Blue Lodge.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.650 align:middle line:10%
And that is 10
additional degrees

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:10%
for a total of how many?

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.470 align:middle line:10%
>> 13.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Coincidence?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:13.847 align:middle line:90%
I think not.

00:27:13.847 --> 00:27:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the brothers--
most of the brothers, they

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:17.110 align:middle line:90%
don't get that.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.760 align:middle line:84%
You guys already
know more than a lot

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.550 align:middle line:84%
of the brothers that are
York Rite Masons now.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
They don't get the
significance of 13,

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.580 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't
been taught it.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like everybody--
every time I

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.700 align:middle line:84%
ask that question about
the five-pointed star,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.770 align:middle line:84%
nobody raises their
hand, because they just

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:90%
haven't been told.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
They have been enlightened,
because it's been veiled.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The goddess has been
pushed into the shadows,

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:90%
but she's emerging.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, we go through this.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, the York Rite is basically
made up of three parts--

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.700 align:middle line:84%
the Royal Arch, the Cryptic
Council, and then the Chivalric

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Degrees, or, at the very end
when you go through this,

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:90%
you are knighted as a Templar.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:90%
And I have done that as well.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But within these middle degrees
of the Cryptic Council--

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.990 align:middle line:90%
I can use this, too--

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.870 align:middle line:84%
something amazing happened
in this degree right here.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It's called the Select Master.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell
you too much, but I

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:84%
have to tell you enough so
you understand what happened.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Basically, in this degree--
and most of our degrees

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:84%
take place during a particular
time in biblical history.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, it was at
the time of the completion

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.710 align:middle line:90%
of the first temple.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:90%
And the triangle is--

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.110 align:middle line:84%
each side of this triangle
represents three people,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:90%
the three grandmasters--

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon; Hiram Abiff, who
was the master architect that

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
oversaw construction
of the temple;

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and Hiram King of
Tyre, which is Lebanon,

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:84%
where all the supplies
came and the workers came

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.240 align:middle line:90%
to build the temple.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
happens in our degrees,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.290 align:middle line:84%
which are made up of part
theatrical performance and part

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
lecture, is we
learn about what is

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.910 align:middle line:84%
in and on the Ark
of the Covenant.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Can't tell you, but
that's what we learn.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing that
happens is, in the degree,

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.965 align:middle line:84%
the three grandmasters
decide that they

00:29:10.965 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
were going to build a secret
vault under the sanctum

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.210 align:middle line:84%
sanctorum where all of the
holy treasures are, right?

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to put a
copy of all the true treasures

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:84%
in this secret vault that is
nine levels below the sanctum

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.360 align:middle line:90%
santorum.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And so we learn about that.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But then when the lecture
part comes at the end

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.250 align:middle line:84%
with the White Hat,
the 33rd degree--

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.250 align:middle line:84%
and if you even talk about
it, you won't get it.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going
to talk about it.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And I remember he said this.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, and the other eight
arches were built by 22 men

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:84%
from [? Gable. ?]
And I went, 8 and 22?

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Those are the first two numbers
in the Kensington Rune Stone.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't hear
another thing after that.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as the
ritual was over,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.125 align:middle line:90%
I go over to my Masonic mentor.

00:29:57.125 --> 00:29:59.250 align:middle line:84%
I said, John, do you have
the ritual book for this?

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, give me that.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:03.320 align:middle line:90%
And I started going through it.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:90%
And holy crap, watch this.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:10%
So 8 and 22.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.460 align:middle line:10%
Now, I can't tell
you about the ritual,

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:10%
but all I can tell you is
the next thing that happens

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.150 align:middle line:10%
is there are two guards.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And then there's only one guard,
because something happens.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:10%
And then there's a
person who's introduced,

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.350 align:middle line:10%
one guy, who, you
know, he wasn't

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:36.280 align:middle line:10%
supposed to go in and find
the vault, and he does.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And then in there is--

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.970 align:middle line:10%
what's-- one thing you guys all
know that's in the Ark, right?

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.196 align:middle line:10%
Is what?

00:30:44.196 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:10%
The 10 Commandments.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.620 align:middle line:10%
10 men read from
blood and death.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, guess what happens at
that point in the ritual?

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.860 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't go well for somebody.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Red from blood and death.

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the second ark is
another 10 commandments, right?

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And then 14-- the number 14 is
the number of resurrection, OK?

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:10%
There are-- Osiris's body
was cut up into 14 pieces,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:10%
if you read the Isis of
Cyrus mysteries, right?

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then she finds 13
pieces, Isis, right?

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And then the 14th piece is the
phallic that she doesn't find,

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.940 align:middle line:84%
so she crafts one either
out of gold or beeswax.

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:90%
She impregnated herself.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Horus is born, and then the
whole cycle starts over again.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And all this story is
is an allegorical story

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:38.190 align:middle line:84%
about the annual cycle of
life on the planet, right?

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Birth in the spring,
death in the fall,

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:45.830 align:middle line:84%
resurrection on my
birthday, December 21.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:90%
That's freaky.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so you get
the point, right?

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:84%
By the way, do you know how
many stations of the cross

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.393 align:middle line:84%
there are in the
Roman Catholic church?

00:31:54.393 --> 00:31:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> 14.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.580 align:middle line:90%
>> 14, 14.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Resurrection, right?

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And all I can tell you is we
have it in Freemasonry, too,

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:90%
but I can't tell you about it.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I didn't tell you.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
So in the ritual
book, at one point,

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.850 align:middle line:84%
it says there hours of labor
were from 9:00 at night

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:18.760 align:middle line:84%
until 12:00, when all prying
eyes are closed and asleep.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, 9 plus what is 12?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.090 align:middle line:90%
3, right?

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Is it a coincidence there are
nine lines of text on the front

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:90%
and three on the side?

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.570 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So then because of the
hooked X and its likeness

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to the Hebrew aleph, which is
the first letter in the Hebrew

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:84%
alphabet-- and one of the things
in Scottish Rite Mason we are

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.540 align:middle line:84%
exposed to is the
Kabbalah, which

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I find eminently fascinating.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:90%
And I dug into it.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And I found this.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So in the Tree of Life-- you
guys know what the Tree of Life

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.470 align:middle line:90%
is, right?

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.410 align:middle line:90%
There are 10 spheres--

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:90%
pay attention to the numbers--

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.320 align:middle line:90%
that create 22 paths.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.857 align:middle line:90%
There are three columns.

00:33:07.857 --> 00:33:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's stuff
up on the Rune Stone

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.730 align:middle line:90%
I have not told you about.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:90%
The number three is significant.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:84%
The three-- three is
all through Freemasonry.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.650 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
The Trinity, oh yeah,
we talked about that--

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
for a total of 32
emanations of deity.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:10%
However, there is a
hidden 11th sphere

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:10%
that creates the hidden 33rd
if you reach that level, right?

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:33.150 align:middle line:10%
I find this interesting.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.820 align:middle line:10%
On the Rune Stone,
the first two numbers

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.450 align:middle line:10%
are eight plus 22 is what?

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:90%
What number?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> 30

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:90%
>> 30.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Plus two shelters one
day's journey north.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.470 align:middle line:90%
Another coincidence?

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.390 align:middle line:90%
This is too many.

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, this is
not a coincidence.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So what it tells you is
that this monk was initiated

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.210 align:middle line:90%
that carved the stone.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.530 align:middle line:90%
No question about it.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.720 align:middle line:84%
In the Enochian
mysteries, he understood

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that, and the secret
vault, and the nine arches,

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
which runs all
through the Templars

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.780 align:middle line:90%
and the mystery over here.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Just know that.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:90%
So what does this all mean?

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And why are we here?

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Why are you all here
at this conference?

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
We're all trying to figure out
those big questions in life,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.030 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to find, you
know, what happens after I die.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Is there a God?

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:90%
I mean, why-- why am I here?

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:90%
All these things.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
what is the result?

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The net result is it's
all about you, right?

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:43.760 align:middle line:90%
It all comes back to you.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.969 align:middle line:84%
And two words--
know thyself, right?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.498 align:middle line:90%
That's at the end.

00:34:49.498 --> 00:34:51.040 align:middle line:84%
That's what Freemasonry
is all about.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.040 align:middle line:90%


00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So I thought about that, and
I started doing some research.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And you might know
this, you might not.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many vertebrae
we have in our bodies?

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Most people do, not everybody.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.610 align:middle line:90%
32.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we're talking about
the Kabbalah and this being part

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:84%
of the origin of that,
then there's a 33rd, right?

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.560 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.360 align:middle line:90%
It's your head.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So let me ask you this.

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how many bones
are in the human skull?

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.460 align:middle line:90%
You're going to like this.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.720 align:middle line:10%
There are eight here
in your cranium,

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:10%
and 14 in your face
for a total of what?

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:10%
22.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.780 align:middle line:10%
I think we know where this
all started, right here.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:90%
So now, I'm enlightened.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm digging all
this stuff, right?

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to tell you
a story about a secret document

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are now just
introducing to the world,

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.610 align:middle line:84%
now that you have
a little background

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.880 align:middle line:90%
to appreciate this even better.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.700 align:middle line:90%
This document basically was--

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.950 align:middle line:84%
came forward through
these two guys.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, Don is
a really cool guy.

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And all I can tell you is he
and this guy, Bill Jackson--

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Bill is the one that bought
the document back in 1971.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.250 align:middle line:84%
These two guys were
best friends who

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:84%
worked for an agency that
basically does things

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.650 align:middle line:84%
with our government that
we never hear about.

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And it is so James
Bond-like stuff.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm reading about
their missions,

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm trying to talk to Don.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Bill died in 2000.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And these are the only two
known photos that I could find.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.640 align:middle line:84%
This came from a video, and
he doesn't have a mustache,

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.648 align:middle line:90%
so that's a disguise.

00:36:48.648 --> 00:36:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you,
the stuff these guys

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:90%
did, you wouldn't even believe.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with taking
care of business, like I said,

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.360 align:middle line:90%
that we don't hear about.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.630 align:middle line:84%
But-- and because of the
world that they dwelled in,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that's part of the
reason he got access

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and was able to
buy this document.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll just leave it at that.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.400 align:middle line:90%
So this story's crazy.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:90%
They were doing espionage.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.800 align:middle line:90%
They were spies.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.170 align:middle line:84%
They were breaking
up pedophile rings.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And they would just go
eliminate these people.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.620 align:middle line:90%
That's what they did.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And they would deal with
really crazy stuff, and really

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:90%
bad stuff.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:90%
But they would take care of it.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.920 align:middle line:84%
These are-- these guys
are unsung heroes,

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.100 align:middle line:84%
in my mind, that take care of
bad people that we don't even

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.920 align:middle line:84%
know are there, and we don't
even know they're gone.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And they take care of
it, and they never--

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.180 align:middle line:90%
nobody knows what they've done.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.100 align:middle line:84%
They do this, they get paid,
and they don't get any credit,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.838 align:middle line:90%
and they don't want credit.

00:37:42.838 --> 00:37:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give him credit,
and he says don't do it.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So I can't do it, but
that's what they do.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.170 align:middle line:84%
But the prior sign,
well, it's always there.

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so in 1968, these
guys are young guys.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they just--
they live in New York,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:84%
and they go up to
the Hudson River

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.910 align:middle line:84%
to a place called Bannerman
Island, where there's a castle.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's like
a park, and you

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.690 align:middle line:84%
can go there and tour
the ruins of this castle.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so what
they did was they

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:84%
would go diving in the
water off Bannerman Island.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is there was
an explosion on the island.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Francis Bannerman dealt
in munitions and weapons.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And he started--
well, the father

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.518 align:middle line:84%
started selling during the
Civil War to both sides.

00:38:23.518 --> 00:38:25.060 align:middle line:84%
He didn't care, he
was a businessman.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:26.520 align:middle line:90%
You want the stuff?

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Pay me the money.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Then his son actually got
in trouble selling weapons

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to different countries
in the First World War,

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and he died 1916, and the
castle fell into ruins.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
there was an explosion.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And all these munitions
ended up in the water.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, these guys were
scuba diving for the stuff,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.210 align:middle line:84%
picking it up, and then
they were selling it back

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in the pawn shops in New York.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so they're doing
their thing one day.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And Don said, along the
shore, I spotted this box that

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.920 align:middle line:90%
had a ball on top.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And he grabbed two
of these things.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.100 align:middle line:90%
This is a reproduction of it.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:84%
He gave it to Bill, because
Bill's wife, Muriel,

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.950 align:middle line:90%
was a gardener.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.050 align:middle line:84%
And he thought maybe she
could use this thing.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, Bill's young
son, Mark, was walking

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.910 align:middle line:90%
with one of these bulbs--

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
these square things
about a year later.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And he tripped and fell, and
he dropped it, and it broke.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And they found some
things inside of it.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they found
was this brass seal right here,

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:middle line:90%
which is opened.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was filled with little
metal inserts and carvings

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.130 align:middle line:90%
and Theban characters.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Theban characters is
the coded language

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.610 align:middle line:84%
that goes back to
the 12th century

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars used to use
to encode certain documents

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.155 align:middle line:90%
that people couldn't read.

00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And this thing's
covered with it.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And this started a journey of
these guys trying to figure out

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.370 align:middle line:90%
what the heck is going on.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Bill
Jackson-- and it's

00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
a complicated story, had to
do with World War II buddies.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the guys who worked
for the French resistance

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.520 align:middle line:84%
during the Second World
War, after the war,

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.992 align:middle line:90%
he became a rare book dealer.

00:40:08.992 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:90%
Bill Jackson went over there.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.360 align:middle line:84%
He bought a book that
had a reference to one

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of the words that was on one of
the metal inserts in that seal.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And the reference was
something called--

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.930 align:middle line:84%
we now call the
Cremona Document.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.700 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it was called.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So he went to Rome, and he met
with a family, the Benvenuto

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:34.260 align:middle line:84%
family, and he bought this
document in early 1971.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And there were
actually two copies.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
The Benvenuto family sold the
other one to the Scottish Rite

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Grand Lodge, or the
Grand Lodge of Scotland.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.790 align:middle line:84%
They could not decipher--
it's all in Theban.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
These are Theban
characters right here.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's the Theban alphabet.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a 1 to 1 substitution,
but the problem

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.730 align:middle line:84%
is, if you don't
have the key phrase,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.150 align:middle line:84%
the cipher code to see where
you put things in order,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.710 align:middle line:90%
you can't decipher it.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But it is a 1 to 1
letter substitution.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And there's a long story behind
this page, which we have,

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.000 align:middle line:90%
the original page.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, this is
a 12th century story

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to tell you, but this
is not a 12th century document.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a copy of a copy
of a copy, probably.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how
many generations.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:25.290 align:middle line:84%
We do know that this was
copied after 1856, because some

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.890 align:middle line:84%
of the treasure
maps were written

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.010 align:middle line:84%
on the back of illustration
pages in the books,

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.190 align:middle line:84%
because, on the back of
illustration pages in 1800

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.170 align:middle line:90%
era books are blank, right?

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:38.470 align:middle line:90%
On the backside.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But these-- we have the
images, and we figured out

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.850 align:middle line:90%
which book it was.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So this is probably
1860s, but we're talking

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:90%
about 12th century information.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Everybody clear on that?

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
understand that.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So the second copy donated.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.280 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't figure it
out, so they sold it.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Bill took-- spent
two years translating this.

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And the first part of
the document is written--

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.857 align:middle line:84%
it's in Theban and coded from
three different languages.

00:42:07.857 --> 00:42:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And then once you do the cipher
phrase, you can figure it out.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:84%
It's like two layers
of embedded codes

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:84%
to protect people from
knowing what this stuff is.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And you'll understand
why shortly.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.455 align:middle line:84%
Barry Fell-- have any of
you heard of Barry Fell?

00:42:22.455 --> 00:42:24.330 align:middle line:84%
He's probably one of
the most-- he's probably

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:31.770 align:middle line:84%
the most famous person in the
history of alternative history.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.730 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book in
1976 called America BC.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
academic to come out and say

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.920 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of people
coming here before Chris.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was very brave.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:46.620 align:middle line:84%
He received a lot of criticism,
but it was really a big step.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.710 align:middle line:84%
He was approached by Bill
Jackson, and he read this--

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.050 align:middle line:84%
once the document
was deciphered,

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:53.850 align:middle line:84%
he was so excited
about it he wanted

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:55.320 align:middle line:90%
to publish it in this book.

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And he wouldn't give
it back to Bill.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Not a good idea.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.710 align:middle line:90%
Bill got it back.

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:90%
That's another story.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the first
part of the document--

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and then-- so here's
what happened.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So Bill got-- eventually,
he was a doctor,

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and he had diagnosed himself
with arterial sclerosis.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.130 align:middle line:90%
He knew he was dying.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote a 13 page
narrative, 13 pages.

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.490 align:middle line:90%


00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.758 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:43:24.758 --> 00:43:25.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all I'll tell you.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so let's
just get back-- go back.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.770 align:middle line:90%
This is the title page.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And this in Latin.

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:35.430 align:middle line:90%
The truth will set you free.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Here is the table of
subjects, all in Theban.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find this
quite interesting.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:45.090 align:middle line:84%
These are the first two
pages as table of subjects.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The first document that's
referenced in here,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:90%
the Gospel of Mary Magdalene.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.920 align:middle line:84%
You know that one that didn't
make it in, or one of the ones

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.250 align:middle line:90%
that did make it in?

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's right here.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:84%
The next three are the gospels
of Matthew, Mark, and John.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The next thing here it talks
about is the voyage of 1178

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Master de Sudeley.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.100 align:middle line:90%
Just hold that thought.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.310 align:middle line:90%
And then these two things--

00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:26.390 align:middle line:84%
oh, by the way, right there,
hooked X's, my hooked X.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And what have I been
saying for all these years?

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It's connected to the Templars,
and then this shows up.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Is somebody punking me or what?

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.160 align:middle line:90%
No, it's real.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And that proves that we are
right about what this is.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, these two documents--
the Black Chant Enchantment--

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:45.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want that
is either, the Picture

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.680 align:middle line:90%
of the Objects in the Tunnel.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.940 align:middle line:10%
Sounds good though, doesn't it?

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, remember, this document
is a compilation of documents.

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:55.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not just one
continuous thing.

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see what I
mean by that in a sec.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.850 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in the first
part is there are six nights.

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:07.520 align:middle line:90%
We're in Jerusalem.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not dated, but
we know it's somewhere

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.210 align:middle line:90%
between 1110 and 1118.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.600 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem has been captured.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.110 align:middle line:84%
The Templars are controlling
the Temple Mount.

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And these guys go in
under the south wall.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't go under
the Dome of the Rock,

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:90%
which everybody thinks.

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.430 align:middle line:10%
And they find their way down
to a secret chamber, a ritual

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.410 align:middle line:10%
chamber, which I
can't tell you about.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.930 align:middle line:10%
I don't have time.

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.940 align:middle line:10%
That's where they
found the treasure.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:10%
This narrative tells us
exactly what the treasure

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.320 align:middle line:10%
was the Templars found.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.620 align:middle line:10%
This is what everybody's
been wondering, right?

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.950 align:middle line:90%
You're going to know right now.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So at the four corners of
a squared floor defined

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:54.320 align:middle line:84%
by a marble stone set in a
form forming an oblong square--

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:90%
2 to 1 ratio, right?

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.150 align:middle line:90%
The secret to sacred geometry--

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.030 align:middle line:90%
rests four limestone boxes.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:90%
They're called bone boxes.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And every first century Hebrew
buried the bones of their dead

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:05.610 align:middle line:90%
in them.

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are loculi behind each
one, but no bodies are within.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So you guys understand what
the ossuary culture was, right?

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.500 align:middle line:84%
In the first century, this
Essenes, Jesus and his people,

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.260 align:middle line:84%
had a very unique
burial practice.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what they would do

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.380 align:middle line:84%
is they had underground tombs
that were made up of two rooms.

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.180 align:middle line:84%
The first tomb-- or first
room was open to the south,

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:29.980 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.200 align:middle line:90%
It was open, right?

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can walk right
in, and it was flat.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they
would perform rituals.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And only the family
could process

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.578 align:middle line:90%
the body of the deceased.

00:46:40.578 --> 00:46:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So they would bring the body
in, they would prepare it,

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.570 align:middle line:84%
they would wash it, annoint
it with perfumes and oils,

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.650 align:middle line:90%
then wrap it in a shroud.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Then they would bring it
through a small doorway

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:84%
into the second room, which
was the burial chamber that

00:46:53.100 --> 00:47:00.240 align:middle line:84%
had tunnels, loculi, going off
the main body of the chamber.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.640 align:middle line:84%
And then but above
that, there were benches

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that were cut into the rock.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And they would place
the body there.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And they would leave it
for one to two years,

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.570 align:middle line:90%
until it decomposed.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Then they would
collect the bones

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and put them inside these
bone boxes called ossuaries.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And these ossuaries
are only big enough so

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that the two largest bones
in the body, the femurs,

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:90%
fit in crossed.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:90%
The skull goes in last.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And now, you know the origin
of the skull and crossbones.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's associated--

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:37.290 align:middle line:84%
1600, 17-- with the
Templars, right?

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Hm, weird.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, you know why.

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the loculi.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.170 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
bodies are placed.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you would
be interred in the family

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:50.260 align:middle line:90%
tomb in perpetuity.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:51.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So Hugh de Payens,
because they're

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.050 align:middle line:84%
referencing Hugh, co-founder
and grand master of the Knights

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:03.150 align:middle line:84%
Templar, circa 1120 notes it
is strange in one of the boxes

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that the head is not
separated on the spine,

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:09.530 align:middle line:90%
but cleanly severed.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.260 align:middle line:90%
On the spine, cleanly severed.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This man died when his head was
cut off with a very sharp ax.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:18.170 align:middle line:84%
The bones show
little splintering

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:90%
where the axe slid over them.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:20.540 align:middle line:90%
There is a name.

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:90%
I read a little Ivri text.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.370 align:middle line:84%
It is to me that falls out
the making of what is written.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:28.010 align:middle line:90%
It is Yon.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's no
J back then, right?

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Probably John the Baptist.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Definitely John the Baptist.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I will tell you another secret.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:40.990 align:middle line:84%
In Freemasonry,
all of our lodges

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:45.780 align:middle line:84%
are dedicated to
the Holy St. John.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Jesus is never mentioned.

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And I always wondered why.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going
to find out why.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.010 align:middle line:90%
Bernard bags the bones.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:06.880 align:middle line:84%
They took him, the
initiator, the initiated.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So here's the next box.

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:12.310 align:middle line:84%
In the box to the left
are 12 long clay tubes

00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:15.850 align:middle line:84%
with writings in one that
we break the wax seal on.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.910 align:middle line:84%
It is all in Hebrew
text, Ivri text.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And I see that it
is the book of God,

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:84%
but in Scriptuo
continua-- in other words,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.900 align:middle line:84%
there's no spaces between
words or sentences.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no punctuation.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just one big,
long narrative.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you have to know
how to read it--

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:84%
making it most
difficult to read.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.250 align:middle line:84%
There are others in
the strange script.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.740 align:middle line:90%
We take all of them.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.720 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.120 align:middle line:90%
In the third box, ossuary.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:46.710 align:middle line:10%
Below them and stacked
in a pyramid shape

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.790 align:middle line:10%
are small, elongated
blocks of gold,

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:52.660 align:middle line:10%
each stamped with the seal
that Beaumont recognizes

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.120 align:middle line:10%
as the Ivri King Solomon.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.060 align:middle line:10%
This is a treasure beyond
our wildest dreams.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.135 align:middle line:10%
This will help with
the money-moving plans.

00:50:01.135 --> 00:50:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Establishing the sanctuary,
the new Jerusalem

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.590 align:middle line:84%
was already in place back
then in the 12th century.

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.590 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing that you
need to learn about these Venus

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.650 align:middle line:84%
families, as we call them,
because all these guys

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:18.700 align:middle line:90%
are part of it.

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.470 align:middle line:90%
Bernard was part of it.

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were just one
blip on this long continuum.

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The Venus families are
patient, they are smart,

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and they are still with us.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.970 align:middle line:84%
The last box is now opened
quickly, expecting more gold.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But below the sheep hides--
they recovered in sheep hides--

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:90%
we find none.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Instead, there are five devices
of metal and of a curious type.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And in my new book, these
are all described in detail.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's to such
a level of detail

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that Bill Jackson and Don and
the guys in the Spartan group,

00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:53.890 align:middle line:84%
they actually made these
instruments, and they worked.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Two of them were for building,
two were navigation devices--

00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.250 align:middle line:84%
one tracking the movement of
Venus, because their movements

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.010 align:middle line:84%
are so accurate-- and
the fifth was a cryptex

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.770 align:middle line:90%
for deciphering script.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:10.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's the treasure.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So the next part of the document
has to do with the scrolls,

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:17.850 align:middle line:84%
because, in those
scroll, it talked

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:22.350 align:middle line:84%
about other first century
scrolls that were brought over

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:90%
here to the land of Onteora--

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:27.150 align:middle line:84%
that's what they
called North America--

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to hide those scrolls
in the first century.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then six decades
later, a Templar group

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.070 align:middle line:84%
was established, led
by Sir Ralph de Sudeley

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:43.170 align:middle line:84%
to come over here to get those
scrolls at a place called

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:46.580 align:middle line:90%
the Temple of the Goddess.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Why'd I do that?

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It was a three-year voyage
that began in Wales.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.240 align:middle line:84%
We know right where
de Sudeley's from.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.100 align:middle line:90%
He's a real historical figure.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Six ships and 140 men and women.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.123 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.123 --> 00:52:02.540 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
they had to do was

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:05.540 align:middle line:84%
go to Denmark to see
the King of Denmark,

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.490 align:middle line:90%
who was a Templar knight.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And they needed
somebody in his court

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.890 align:middle line:90%
to lead them back to Onteora.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.688 align:middle line:90%
It was a woman named Altomara.

00:52:15.688 --> 00:52:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, how the heck
is this woman going

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:20.630 align:middle line:84%
to know where to go
over in North America?

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Because she was indigenous
and had been brought over.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But the king made one of
the Knights marry her.

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:32.090 align:middle line:84%
So Leon the Spaniard
married her.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
were really in love,

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:37.070 align:middle line:84%
because, as you read the
story, it's just unbelievable,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:38.690 align:middle line:90%
but it's really cool.

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Week 20 and 6, they dropped off.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:44.510 align:middle line:90%
26 is what?

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:90%
2 times 13.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that you look for when

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:52.250 align:middle line:84%
you're reading these documents
and you're trying to vet them

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:54.050 align:middle line:90%
is look at the numbers.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.980 align:middle line:84%
They always use
these sacred numbers.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they're calling
a deity to protect them,

00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the great goddess
to protect them,

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.750 align:middle line:90%
to help us with this mission.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Altomara led them to the
Temple of the Goddess

00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.710 align:middle line:84%
in the land called
Onteora, which we now

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:19.160 align:middle line:84%
call the Catskill Mountains, and
specifically Hunter Mountain.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.860 align:middle line:84%
After they completed
their mission,

00:53:21.860 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:84%
they wintered over on
one of the islands, which

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.240 align:middle line:90%
is now northern Long Island.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.910 align:middle line:84%
They built a ship,
and they sailed home.

00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And de Sudeley went
to Seborga, Italy,

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and he sat down with the then
Grand Master, Grandmaster Odon,

00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.050 align:middle line:90%
and he gave his deposition.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And the Cistercian
monks recorded it,

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.510 align:middle line:90%
and that is this story.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are the names
of the six Templar Knights.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.310 align:middle line:10%
And I have one highlighted.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:10%
Remember that name,
Lionel de Walderne.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:58.270 align:middle line:90%


00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.190 align:middle line:10%
So Bill Jackson, first
thing he did was he

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:03.110 align:middle line:10%
called his friend Don.

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.468 align:middle line:90%
Now, Don was always available.

00:54:05.468 --> 00:54:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just tell
you a quick story.

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Don's fiancee was killed
in one of their missions.

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.420 align:middle line:84%
She was shot in the head,
and she was pregnant.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And that was in the early '60s.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was so traumatized by
that he never had another--

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:23.100 align:middle line:84%
he never was engaged and
never got married, never

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:90%
had any children.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.390 align:middle line:90%
He's 77 right now.

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And for a guy that did certain
things that I know about,

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.170 align:middle line:90%
he's the softest guy now.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.970 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like, Don,
that can't be you.

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:38.810 align:middle line:84%
He sends me like
presents all the time.

00:54:38.810 --> 00:54:42.170 align:middle line:84%
He built me a box to
deliver some pages,

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:43.580 align:middle line:90%
you know, from the document.

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:90%
He built this box with my name.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.730 align:middle line:90%
It's just amazing.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so Don was
always available.

00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So Jackson would say, hey, I
want to go up to Newfoundland,

00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
where one of the ships was
lost of de Sudeley's journey.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They lost one, hit rocks, they
had to offload everything,

00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:59.970 align:middle line:90%
and they scuttled it.

00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want anyone
knowing they were there.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:06.490 align:middle line:84%
They go up in 1971,
and they found it.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Guess what we're going to do?

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:11.350 align:middle line:90%
We're planning to go up there.

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:14.570 align:middle line:84%
So that convinced Jackson
the story was true.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So then the next
part took six years

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Catskill
Mountains, slowly looking

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.260 align:middle line:90%
for the Tomb of Altomara.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to spoil the story,

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.740 align:middle line:84%
I want you to get the
book and read the story,

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.013 align:middle line:90%
because it'll make you cry.

00:55:29.013 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But eventually,
there was a battle

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:33.458 align:middle line:84%
between some of the warring
tribes and the people

00:55:33.458 --> 00:55:35.500 align:middle line:84%
of the mountain, of the
temple of the gods, which

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.620 align:middle line:90%
was run by women.

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.300 align:middle line:90%
And Altomara was killed.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.960 align:middle line:84%
They burned her body, they
put it in a rectangular box,

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:47.515 align:middle line:84%
and they buried it inside
of a small cave right here.

00:55:47.515 --> 00:55:48.890 align:middle line:10%
And I've got more
pictures, but I

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:51.260 align:middle line:10%
don't show them, because I don't
want people to go up there.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.843 align:middle line:10%
But that's what they
were looking for,

00:55:52.843 --> 00:55:56.180 align:middle line:10%
was that Tomb of Altomara.

00:55:56.180 --> 00:56:02.020 align:middle line:10%
And on October 11 of
1977, they found it.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And inside were offerings,
really cool things

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.570 align:middle line:10%
that were left, including
this right here, which

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:13.920 align:middle line:10%
is an 11 carat rough diamond,
uncut, that was inside

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.520 align:middle line:10%
this little urn here that
was inside that box, which

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:10%
was inside that box.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole bunch of
stuff you can read about.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But then what they did
is they resealed it,

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.960 align:middle line:84%
they put her back in the
tomb, and then they left.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.270 align:middle line:90%
And then the story was over.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.380 align:middle line:84%
And Don still didn't
know what was going on.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.660 align:middle line:84%
He was there on the mountain
when they found this.

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so Jackson
decided that he

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:41.280 align:middle line:84%
was going to write a book
about this in the '70s.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But what happened is he
had such a bad experience

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.495 align:middle line:84%
with the academics,
including, sadly, Barry Fell.

00:56:47.495 --> 00:56:48.495 align:middle line:90%
He became disillusioned.

00:56:48.495 --> 00:56:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, screw it.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
a novel about this.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.730 align:middle line:90%
So he started writing the novel.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And he came up with
a bunch of stuff.

00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And some of that stuff is
now on the Oak Island Show,

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's fiction, and
it's a long story.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to get into
it, but what happened

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:11.370 align:middle line:84%
is Bill diagnosised--
he was diagnosed

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:14.100 align:middle line:84%
with arterial sclerosis
when he was into this book,

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and then he just gave up.

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And then he sold the
document to the Vatican.

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:23.277 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys remember the
movie the da Vinci Code?

00:57:23.277 --> 00:57:25.110 align:middle line:84%
You might want to write
this down and Google

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:26.940 align:middle line:84%
this guy, the name
Paul Marcinkus,

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Archbishop Paul Marcinkus.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:35.580 align:middle line:84%
You remember the monk, Silas,
the bad guy in the movie?

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.910 align:middle line:84%
That character was modeled
after Paul Marcinkus.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:40.870 align:middle line:90%
He was a bad guy.

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:44.220 align:middle line:84%
He was the only guy that had
a key to the pope's chamber,

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:45.390 align:middle line:90%
sleeping chamber.

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Remember Pope John Paul I who
died after 33 days in 1978?

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Marcinkus is the
one that killed him.

00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:01.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the guy that Jackson
sold the document to in 1994,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.120 align:middle line:84%
and he got a lot of money for
it, which tells you something,

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.020 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:08.140 align:middle line:84%
If the Vatican thought
it was important,

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:09.932 align:middle line:90%
it must be important.

00:58:09.932 --> 00:58:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all these years that
I've been working with Don--

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.170 align:middle line:90%
I met him in 2006.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been vetting this, and
only now on my publishing

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:21.300 align:middle line:84%
it, because I'm confident
this is all real.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:26.000 align:middle line:90%
So Don called me in 2009.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, Scott,
I need some help.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.912 align:middle line:90%
I go, what?

00:58:28.912 --> 00:58:30.620 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to go
up on the mountain.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I need some fresh legs.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, cool.

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So I got my son, Grant;
my friend, David Brody;

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:43.550 align:middle line:84%
and my other friend, Steve St.
Clair, of that family, yes.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And we went up on the mountain.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And he had this goofy map right
here, which looks like what?

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:50.420 align:middle line:90%
A compass and square.

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:51.710 align:middle line:10%
So we go up on the mountain.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what are
we doing up here?

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think--

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.550 align:middle line:84%
I think these places are
marked on the mountain.

00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:01.520 align:middle line:90%
So this is a little stream.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
called Table Rock.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:07.700 align:middle line:90%
That's Table Rock right there.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.250 align:middle line:10%
And these are pictures
of different things

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:14.060 align:middle line:10%
from when they were up on
the mountain in the '70s.

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things that's
talked about in the Cremona

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Document is a large
stone in a ravine, right?

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.166 align:middle line:84%
In the ravine where
we are on Hunter.

00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:28.220 align:middle line:84%
It had a particular shape,
reminded me of a grave.

00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.080 align:middle line:90%
And this is that stone.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.560 align:middle line:90%
That's my son, Grant.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So that's how they
knew where they were

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:35.570 align:middle line:90%
when they found that stone.

00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:38.672 align:middle line:84%
So as we were going
up the mountain,

00:59:38.672 --> 00:59:42.620 align:middle line:90%
we found this, a delta carving.

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The delta's is a
symbol of deity.

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:48.500 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty good start.

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And that is--
remember the square?

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It's at the bottom, where
the two arms go like this.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:55.952 align:middle line:90%
That's that point.

00:59:55.952 --> 00:59:57.410 align:middle line:10%
Then we go a little
farther, and we

00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.170 align:middle line:10%
find a Theban B that's
carved on the block, which

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:10%
is the left arm of the square.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we find
the goose that's

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.350 align:middle line:84%
talked about in the
Cremona Document, which

01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is the right arm of the square.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And on Table Rock,
you're looking down,

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.910 align:middle line:90%
you can see everything.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:19.740 align:middle line:90%
It's steep, and it's dangerous.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why he wanted
to go with him.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he was pretty
excited when we found that.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:24.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget that.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.990 align:middle line:90%
I go, Don, smile.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:31.280 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do now?

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
He said there's
something up here.

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:35.210 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, well--

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:37.220 align:middle line:84%
so what I did is I
laid out the map,

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and I calculated the relative
distance between the Theban

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
B and the delta.

01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And where that's compass
arm came across, figured out

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
the distance between the two,
we measured it with a tape.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And then where that spot was,
where that arm intersected,

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.760 align:middle line:90%
I put a flag in the ground.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened is
Steve, and my son, Grant, and I,

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:07.288 align:middle line:84%
we took off up the mountain
to go look for the sand cave,

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:09.080 align:middle line:84%
where there were
artifacts that they found.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.550 align:middle line:90%
And David and Don stayed behind.

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were gone
for three hours.

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we came back, we knew
that they had been digging.

01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And we said, did
you find anything?

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Or did you have the
same look we did?

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yep.

01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They found this,
an inscribed stone.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'll start here
on the backside.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
You know what this symbol is?

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
You ever heard of
the goddess Tanit?

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Tanit?

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%
The Phoenician goddess Tanit?

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.370 align:middle line:84%
With a triangle, and a
circle, and her arms are up,

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.620 align:middle line:90%
sometimes like this?

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
That's what that is, I think.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
But isn't it interesting
there's a dot in the belly?

01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.020 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Pregnant.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
Pregnant maybe, huh?

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%
See this five-pedaled rose?

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And notice how this thing
is carved in straight lines,

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and this is pecked?

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:12.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the symbol for the
house of Magdel, the Magdalen.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.430 align:middle line:90%
It's the wilted rose.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side,
we have Roman numbers

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and a Latin phrase called in
camera, which lawyers still

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
use to this day when they
meet with the judge privately,

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
the two lawyers.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.393 align:middle line:84%
It's called in camera, in
chamber, in tomb, in secret.

01:02:32.393 --> 01:02:33.560 align:middle line:90%
I remember I looked at that.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.692 align:middle line:90%
I go, camera?

01:02:34.692 --> 01:02:36.400 align:middle line:84%
What are they talking
about a camera for?

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%
But we figured it out.

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:40.030 align:middle line:90%
But what does this look like?

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.003 align:middle line:84%
A latitude and a
longitude, right?

01:02:42.003 --> 01:02:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you think we
did as soon as we got off

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
the mountain?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.582 align:middle line:84%
[GIBBERISH] Google
Earth, boom, ch,

01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:50.380 align:middle line:84%
boom, right in the middle
of the woods up in Canada,

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.253 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

01:02:52.253 --> 01:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it dawned
on us, wait a minute,

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
the Prime Meridian wasn't
Greenwich, England back then,

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.980 align:middle line:90%
it was Paris, France.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
That was the headquarters
of the Templars.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So we recalculated, hit
it again, boom, bingo.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.690 align:middle line:90%


01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Montreal, Canada.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:13.800 align:middle line:90%
Why there?

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.050 align:middle line:90%
So now, serious, OK?

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:23.970 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to talk about
is offensive to some peoples'

01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:26.010 align:middle line:90%
belief systems.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
I just want you guys to know
that's not what I'm here to do.

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean any
offense to anybody, OK?

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
So from here on, if
anybody gets offended,

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
it's your own fault, OK?

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Are we good?

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:39.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
Anybody not good?

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:41.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:44.020 align:middle line:90%
You can-- here we go.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to teach you guys
something about symbolism,

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%
colors.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Renaissance
art especially,

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
if you know the colors and the
symbols, the signs, symbols,

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and tokens, you can have a
lot more fun with that art,

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
because almost all of these
artists were initiated.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And they are hiding secrets
within their artwork.

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
you need to know

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
is the symbol of Mary Magdalene.

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
The colors are orange and green,
green for her Celtic roots

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and ideology, and orange
for the region in France

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:25.772 align:middle line:84%
that she disappeared to,
lived out her life, and died.

01:04:25.772 --> 01:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's a beautiful
painting, isn't it?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%


01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:32.925 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is in Montreal.

01:04:32.925 --> 01:04:35.840 align:middle line:90%


01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
This is Notre Dame
Basilica in Montreal.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the next
thing we did was we

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:42.110 align:middle line:90%
took a trip to Montreal.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the basilica, this is one
of the stations of the cross,

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.420 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:49.010 align:middle line:84%
That's Mary
Magdalene, obviously.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.575 align:middle line:90%
Orange and green, right?

01:04:50.575 --> 01:04:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
walked in, there

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
was this painting right here.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It was 14 feet tall.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
It was huge.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
see the colors.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:01.230 align:middle line:90%
We see this child here.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, I see a girl.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.196 align:middle line:90%
What do you guys see?

01:05:06.196 --> 01:05:07.540 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:08.963 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I see.

01:05:08.963 --> 01:05:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's--

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.547 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't know
what the answer is,

01:05:11.547 --> 01:05:12.520 align:middle line:90%
but that's what I see.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The maple leaf for Canada,
the crown, the lily,

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.800 align:middle line:90%
all the symbolism is there.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
But there was something else
really cool about this church,

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and there were statues of
goddesses and stained glass.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
There were women everywhere,
Native American women, too.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.240 align:middle line:90%


01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.530 align:middle line:90%
But here's the pulpit.

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.870 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful, right?

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.290 align:middle line:10%
And at the very top, you have
something-- the triangles,

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:38.690 align:middle line:10%
deity, right?

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:43.962 align:middle line:10%
With Hebrew letters, and it's
called the tetragrammaton.

01:05:43.962 --> 01:05:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I was in Sweden--
remember I told you

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.750 align:middle line:10%
I went there five times when
I was doing my research?

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Church of
Mary Magdalene in Stockholm.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And they had the tetragrammaton
right here with the glory rays.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.380 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a symbol of God.

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.365 align:middle line:84%
And these four Hebrew
letters are [HEBREW]..

01:06:00.365 --> 01:06:02.980 align:middle line:90%


01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the immutable
name of creator.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But in Montreal, that triangle
has different letters.

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Check this out.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the only place
I have ever seen this.

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And that stone told
us to go there.

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:20.420 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
There aren't four
letters, there are three.

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
[LATIN] And you know what
that spells in Latin?

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:32.020 align:middle line:90%


01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Eve.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Just saying, there it is.

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:41.380 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy cool.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So something going
on up there that

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.040 align:middle line:90%
has to do with the goddess.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's get back to
the Cremona Document.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the-- now,
I'll just tell you.

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
This is so cool.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.913 align:middle line:90%
And you can read it in the book.

01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
But you know how de Sudeley got
the right to get the documents?

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.650 align:middle line:84%
He had to go through a three
day ritual, spent three nights

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.712 align:middle line:90%
in three small caves.

01:07:03.712 --> 01:07:04.670 align:middle line:90%
They're still up there.

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I've been in them.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And on the third night, the
priestess of the mountain

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:13.720 align:middle line:90%
offered herself to de Sudeley.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm sorry,
but I have taken vows.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.503 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

01:07:18.503 --> 01:07:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And she looked at him.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you pass,
you can have the scrolls.

01:07:25.390 --> 01:07:27.130 align:middle line:90%
But you can't have them all.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:30.760 align:middle line:90%
So he brought them back, right?

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is a list
of what he got,

01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
because each one of those tubes
had multiple scrolls in them.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.080 align:middle line:90%
He got a lot.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
But I want to point something
out to you right here.

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:43.450 align:middle line:84%
I know that's hard to
read, but we've tried.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:46.000 align:middle line:10%
This is all in
French, but this has

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.590 align:middle line:10%
been translated into English.

01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:49.750 align:middle line:90%
And this is what it says.

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Number 14, 14, a contract of
marriage with Yeshua ben Yosef

01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Amah a
Hesmonium at Canae.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:05.830 align:middle line:84%
This is the marriage document of
Jesus and Mary Magdalene hidden

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.577 align:middle line:90%
over in Onteora.

01:08:07.577 --> 01:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, you know why they
had to get it out of dodge.

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:11.935 align:middle line:84%
If the Romans got
this, it's gone.

01:08:11.935 --> 01:08:15.450 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:17.538 align:middle line:84%
This is what it says
in the document.

01:08:17.538 --> 01:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
We have returned
with the nine tubes,

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.550 align:middle line:90%
many having several scrolls.

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.660 align:middle line:84%
But the marriage
document, Master Odon,

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Grandmaster Odon says is
valued beyond measure.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.300 align:middle line:90%


01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:29.779 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:34.698 align:middle line:84%
So when I became a
Mason, somehow this guy--

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and I can't tell you who he
is, because he doesn't want

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:38.729 align:middle line:84%
to be identified,
but he used to work

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:40.189 align:middle line:90%
in our military for the Navy.

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:41.355 align:middle line:90%
You know what his job was?

01:08:41.355 --> 01:08:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It was to go around the
world and pick up out

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:48.990 align:middle line:84%
of place objects, including
space ships, and bodies,

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:53.399 align:middle line:84%
And they would take it to
facilities in the United States

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:55.439 align:middle line:90%
never to be seen again.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
For 10 years, he
signed a nondisclosure.

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
He is now past that, and he
is sharing stuff with me,

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.520 align:middle line:90%
but I can't share his identity.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.279 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
he shared with me.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
This is a letter that
came from a Mason, who

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
was a monsignor at the
Vatican at the time.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.529 align:middle line:84%
And it says, first,
let me say that it

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:16.350 align:middle line:84%
is true the Catholicus
Mysticus is,

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:19.569 align:middle line:84%
in fact, in our Vatican
archives in storage.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
It is true that the
papyrus in question

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:26.490 align:middle line:84%
was delivered to the Christian
authorities in 220 AD,

01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and that it details the reported
event of one, Mary of Magdala

01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:32.550 align:middle line:84%
had secretly wed
our Lord and Savior.

01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Two, she had his child, a girl.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.859 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Sarah.

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
And three, to avoid possible
persecution of that child,

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
she traveled with
trusted friends

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to what later became known
as Europe, reportedly France.

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:49.649 align:middle line:84%
The papyrus was
delivered by members

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.960 align:middle line:90%
of the Church of Agalactiae.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
I will neither state that
the papyrus is true or false,

01:09:55.170 --> 01:09:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and I can assure you that
the Holy Roman Catholic

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:04.560 align:middle line:84%
church will never allow the
document to be seen in public.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the thing that
might be offensive, OK?

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.800 align:middle line:84%
You guys have heard of
Leonardo da Vinci, right?

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Do you know in 1483
he was commissioned

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.760 align:middle line:84%
to do a painting by the Church
of the Immaculate Conception.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And he did that, and
this is that painting.

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And the church looked at it
and basically said, screw you,

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.690 align:middle line:90%
do it again.

01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:32.420 align:middle line:90%
What did they find so offensive?

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:33.520 align:middle line:90%
You guys tell me.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%


01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.880 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.450 align:middle line:90%


01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know you're
supposed to see?

01:10:41.190 --> 01:10:44.940 align:middle line:84%
This is mother Mary, and this
is Jesus and John the Baptist

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
as children, right?

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, who is this?

01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, now you know
where to look for, right?

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, if that's Mary
Magdalene, how can that

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:58.520 align:middle line:90%
be Jesus and John the Baptist?

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.880 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, then who are they?

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:08.050 align:middle line:90%
This is her child with Jesus.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
This is her child with John the
Baptist, who was killed, right?

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.370 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
She had to keep
everything together,

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
so she was obligated
to marry Jesus.

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And remember, back in those
days, to be a rabbi, first

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and foremost, you were
required to be married,

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and you were required to
have a son for secession.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty crazy, right?

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:42.640 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
You thought the "Da
Vinci Code" was good?

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.010 align:middle line:90%
It just got better.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So you want to see
the second version?

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.543 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, there's
one more thing--

01:11:51.543 --> 01:11:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's that guy?

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Which guy?

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.500 align:middle line:84%
That's John the Baptist's
child right there.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
His name was Jesus,
and this is Judah.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.640 align:middle line:84%
In any case, notice how her
hand is going like this?

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Pointing to who?

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> John the Baptist.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.690 align:middle line:90%
>> John the Baptist.

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Go like this, make that.

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Point your finger like that, OK?

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Tighten your three fingers.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, rotate it 90 degrees.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.241 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

01:12:18.241 --> 01:12:20.840 align:middle line:90%
A compass and square.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
The initiated one right here.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
That's cool, huh?

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.070 align:middle line:90%
Can't have that.

01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:28.240 align:middle line:90%
So he had to do it again.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Two years later,
he submitted this.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, things
are different, right?

01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Can't have her in there,
so we take away the colors,

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.780 align:middle line:84%
put wings on her, so
it's an arch angel.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And now that she's out, and
put halos on them, right?

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, John the Baptist
with a little cross.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.850 align:middle line:84%
This is now hanging
in the Church

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:54.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Immaculate Conception.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
This is hanging in
the Louvre in Paris.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I've seen this one.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.885 align:middle line:84%
I don't really care about
that one, personally.

01:12:59.885 --> 01:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
But in any case, OK, so
now, story's over, right?

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
No, the mystery
that was still left

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:09.260 align:middle line:84%
is, what the hell did we
find on Hunter Mountain?

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.610 align:middle line:90%
What is this stone?

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.260 align:middle line:90%
What is going on in Montreal?

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:18.105 align:middle line:90%
Well, Bill died in 2000.

01:13:18.105 --> 01:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And then his daughter
moved to Ireland,

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
which is where their
family was originally from.

01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:25.332 align:middle line:10%
And three years ago,
she moved to Scotland

01:13:25.332 --> 01:13:27.040 align:middle line:10%
to be with her brother
Mark, the one that

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.775 align:middle line:10%
dropped this and
started the whole thing.

01:13:29.775 --> 01:13:31.400 align:middle line:10%
And as she was going
through her stuff,

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.550 align:middle line:10%
she found some things
from her father.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:37.850 align:middle line:10%
And one of them was
this unopened letter

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:42.680 align:middle line:10%
with a wax seal written to
Master Robert Chevrolet de la

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.160 align:middle line:10%
Salle, the explorer that
came over here, went

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.450 align:middle line:10%
to Montreal in the 1650s,
and went down the Ohio

01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:54.350 align:middle line:10%
and discovered the southern
half of the Mississippi River.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:56.510 align:middle line:90%
He didn't discover anything.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:57.320 align:middle line:90%
So we got this.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Don got this from Melissa,
and he sent me this email.

01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, Don, see if
she'll sell the letter.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Let's buy it.

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:05.720 align:middle line:90%
We've got to have that.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, by the time the
correspondence got back,

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
they had already sold
it, but she was smart.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
She knew we would want it.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:15.205 align:middle line:84%
So the deal-- they sold
it for five figures.

01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
the amount was,

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:19.700 align:middle line:90%
but it was the least $10,000.

01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:22.310 align:middle line:84%
But what she did with
the deal was she said,

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
you have to allow us to take
pictures to send to my father's

01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:29.090 align:middle line:90%
friend, best friend, Don.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:30.740 align:middle line:90%
So they did that.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
So this is de la Salle.

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you open the
letter, they broke the seal.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It's dated May 8--

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:45.650 align:middle line:90%
May 8, 1656.

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:46.450 align:middle line:90%
So for what?

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:50.050 align:middle line:84%
350 years, that
thing was sealed.

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.300 align:middle line:10%
And right here in French,
it says, after reading,

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.510 align:middle line:10%
set this message to flame.

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Then it says here,
this is our last day

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:02.660 align:middle line:10%
on the Temple of the Goddess
on the mountain of Manitou.

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.060 align:middle line:10%
Flatlanders, highlanders,
approach daily.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:06.680 align:middle line:10%
And the people are much afraid.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.020 align:middle line:10%
I have set a message in stone--

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:14.850 align:middle line:10%
that's our stone-- and one in
the Cave of Priestess Altomara.

01:15:14.850 --> 01:15:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember the map-- the
compass and square map?

01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
They got that in the
cave, Altomara's tomb.

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:21.710 align:middle line:90%
That's where that came from.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, ah, he never told me.

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I go-- I go be with
the people of my mother

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
to the south by water, have
gotten a missive from father

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.915 align:middle line:84%
Euler at St. Sulpice
church, which

01:15:34.915 --> 01:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
is where a lot of the scenes
in the "Da Vinci Code"

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.350 align:middle line:90%
were filmed.

01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
I go to the place of the
Sulpicians to the north.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Father Olier sent a
bunch of Sulpician monks

01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
to Montreal to found the first
Sulpician seminary in Montreal.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.080 align:middle line:10%
That's where they sent the
scrolls, beyond the Great North

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.030 align:middle line:10%
River, the St. Lawrence River.

01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:59.950 align:middle line:84%
All of the faithful
also go north.

01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And then he talks
about all the documents

01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:04.390 align:middle line:90%
that de Sudeley did not get.

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:06.960 align:middle line:90%


01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's signed by a guy named
Lionel de Walderne, the 21st.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember that name I
told you to remember?

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
21 generations
later, he goes back.

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:24.105 align:middle line:84%
That's how they kept this
alive that long, 500 years.

01:16:24.105 --> 01:16:27.410 align:middle line:90%


01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:30.130 align:middle line:90%
That's Olier.

01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, when they opened
the letter, there

01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:36.640 align:middle line:84%
was one more thing, this
piece of paper right

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
here with all of this
Masonic symbolism.

01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.090 align:middle line:90%
I know what all that stuff is.

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Celestial, terrestrial
globes, the two pillars,

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:47.630 align:middle line:90%
Jachin and Boaz, all this stuff.

01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:50.770 align:middle line:84%
There's your seal of
Solomon, deity in the middle.

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:53.620 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
are signs of deity.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.495 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
cool on the back.

01:16:55.495 --> 01:16:58.430 align:middle line:90%


01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Let there be light,
and there was light.

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:03.240 align:middle line:90%
All truth prevail.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.860 align:middle line:84%
LdW, Lionel de
Walderne, the 21st.

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
But look at that second X.
It's a hooked X. So here's

01:17:15.170 --> 01:17:17.330 align:middle line:90%
the last question.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Where are those scrolls now?

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.150 align:middle line:90%
There's more coming.

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.880 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:32.180 align:middle line:90%


01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.530 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:37.000 align:middle line:90%
