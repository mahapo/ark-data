00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So I am a follower
of his, and support him,

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:90%
and appreciate him.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.015 align:middle line:84%
And this is going to be another
amazing workshop with William

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.815 align:middle line:90%
Henry.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, thank you,
Debra, very much.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.270 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin with
this wonderful image

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle line:84%
of Quan Yin, the
bodhisattva of compassion

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.760 align:middle line:90%
from the Buddhist tradition.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.610 align:middle line:84%
She's in an elevated state
of consciousness and ascended

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
She has got this
beautiful red sash

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:84%
on that indicates she can
fly through the cosmos.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And she's surrounded
by rainbows.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And she's actually sitting in
a portal, references her status

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:90%
as a rainbow light body being.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.280 align:middle line:84%
She's just beaming love
and compassion to us

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:90%
through this image.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And for all intents and
purposes or for our purpose

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
today, we're going
to place ourselves

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
in the position of
the two acolytes

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.820 align:middle line:84%
who are just on the
edge of her portal,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
just on the edge
of her frequency.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not in it,
because maybe they're

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.520 align:middle line:90%
not quite at that place.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But they are certainly aspiring
to get as close to Quan Yin

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:90%
as they possibly can.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And that is our goal, too.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
We want to be beings that have
more love, more compassion,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe with a few rainbows
thrown in as well.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And so one way that we
can connect with Quan Yin

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is to mirror what we see in the
images that we're looking at.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
two acolytes who

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:84%
are almost opening their hands
in a reiki position, aren't

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.890 align:middle line:90%
they?

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.250 align:middle line:84%
They're receiving some
vibration from Quan Yin.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
They're in an open
and receptive place.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And so let's just take a moment
now to raise our own hands,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.265 align:middle line:84%
to open our own palms to
the frequency, the vibration

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of Quan Yin and what
that means to us

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
personally to get that
sense of deep compassion

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
in our own life, maybe
thinking of a time when

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
we experienced
unconditional love

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.090 align:middle line:90%
or expressed unconditional love.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And let's just take a moment
to put ourself in that space,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:10%
so that we can then move forward
a little closer to Quan Yin's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:10%
frequency.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So that feels good, huh?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:10%
Just opens us up, opens the
heart, puts us in that place,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and then prepares us
even for the next step

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:10%
to connect with, as Quan
Yin does, our true nature,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:10%
our Buddha nature, which is what
we see here as the Shakyamuni

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.470 align:middle line:10%
Buddha in a lotus position,
radiating light, also

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:10%
in his light body.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And the idea, once again,
is that through the image,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.105 align:middle line:90%
we can connect with the Buddha.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And this is
something we're going

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.160 align:middle line:84%
to elaborate on and provide
the science behind it, of how

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:84%
an image can act as a conduit to
an avatar or an ascended being.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient
practice that we're

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
reviving in the modern world
and now bringing together

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
with it the incredible
science that validates

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:90%
exactly how that's possible.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And I love this
image of the Buddha,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
because he's making
eye contact with us.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We are not only
present to the Buddha,

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:84%
but he is present in
the room right now,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.080 align:middle line:84%
according to the principle
of the art of ascension

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:90%
as we're going to elaborate.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key things
that we're seeing here

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
is that he is, again,
making eye contact with us.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important to make
eye contact with an image?

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the eye is the
window to the soul, right?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And so by having that
eye to eye contact,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
it's actually a
soul to soul contact

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are making at this
moment with the Buddha.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So Quan Yin has opened the
frequency for us, brought us

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
into a little more
compassionate frequency.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're in a place where we
can connect with the Buddha.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to spend just
a moment elaborating

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:90%
on the imagery of Quan Yin.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
As an art historian, I'm always
looking for the ultimate image

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to share with you
and then trying

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.757 align:middle line:84%
to connect various
traditions from the Buddhist,

00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to the Christian, to the
Egyptian, to the Tibetan,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to the Mayan, all
across the world,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
looking how they
share a similar story.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So in this image here, we
see Quan Yin holding a child.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
She's a goddess of compassion.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Also, some say she's a
goddess of childbirth as well.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
And so in China
and in Japan, you

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
will find these wonderful
images of Quan Yin.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:90%
She's also called Chenrezig.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:90%
She's called Avalokitesvara.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And she is holding
this child in her arms,

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.410 align:middle line:84%
cuddling it just
like the Virgin Mary.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly like the Virgin Mary.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:84%
But what a lot of
people don't appreciate

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is that the imagery
of Quan Yin actually

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.712 align:middle line:84%
were derived from the
images of the Virgin Mary.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Around the third
or fourth century,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
the earliest Christians high
tailed it out of Jerusalem,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and hit the Silk Road,
and went to Tibet,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and went to China in
these areas bringing

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Christianity with them.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And along with them, they
brought their artwork.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So here, we see the
Virgin Mary, obviously

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:84%
holding the baby
Jesus in her hand.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
He's got in his hand a blue
orb, maybe a blue apple that

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.180 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes the power
of resurrection,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.690 align:middle line:84%
which is what ultimately he
came to Earth to teach us.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And much like the Virgin
Mary-- and this is the key.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese Quan
Yin is said to have

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.740 align:middle line:84%
lived a human life of extreme
self-sacrifice and holiness

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:84%
before she herself
ascended into heaven

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and became the celestial
goddess of mercy and compassion.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So at one point, Quan
Yin, like the Virgin Mary,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
had a human incarnation
and went along

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.540 align:middle line:84%
her path of ascension,
her hero's journey,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately, ascended to
the pure land of Buddhism

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:84%
where she presently
is said to dwell,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
just as Mary is the
first Christian to ascend

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and ascended to the Christian
heaven, a place called Scion.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So that is a very
important aspect of this.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And I love the divine
feminine images

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that are reflective of
the ascension process.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.403 align:middle line:90%
Always like to present that.

00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And as we look in
the detail here,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.640 align:middle line:84%
we see this wonderful
image of Quan Yin wearing

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:90%
this transparent linen robe.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we come in
on this robe here,

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
we see that it's actually
covered with orbs of light

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:90%
that symbolize stars.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Don't you just want
to reach in there

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:90%
and put that robe on yourself?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And feel what it
must be like to wear

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
it-- be wearing a robe of
stars or a robe of light.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is, of
course, the key image

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.548 align:middle line:84%
in many of the
ascension traditions

00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
and which is why Mary wears
a row of stars as well.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it indicates
that she is in her star

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.260 align:middle line:84%
body, her light body,
her resurrection body,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:90%
her glory body.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.475 align:middle line:90%
She's in her ascended frequency.

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:45.610 align:middle line:84%
In the 17th century, we
find this image of Quan Yin.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.240 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting on a throne with
two acolytes on either side.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:84%
She's sitting on a dragon, just
like the Virgin Mary is always

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
shown standing on a
dragon symbolizing

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
the earthly forces of
negativity, but also,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.500 align:middle line:84%
her ability to raise
kundalini as well.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
image of Quan Yin

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is entirely derived from
Christian images of Mary

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the throne,
which a little tip here.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:90%
We won't elaborate on it.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that the
throne that Mary sits on

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.935 align:middle line:84%
is called the Throne of
Solomon, the Throne of Wisdom.

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes called
it the Merkaba.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking at images
with an awakened or enlightened

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
eye of Mary sitting
on the throne,

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
you know that this
isn't an ordinary throne

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.947 align:middle line:84%
like the Queen of
England would sit on.

00:07:30.947 --> 00:07:32.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Queen
of England's throne

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is actually modeled after
the Throne of Solomon, which

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:90%
is actually for the insiders.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:84%
We know that's
actually the Merkaba

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.432 align:middle line:90%
throne, the celestial chariot.

00:07:40.432 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
word Merkaba means,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:90%
a celestial throne chariot.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't an ordinary
throne that she's sitting on.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
She's actually an exemplar
of the Essene Mystery School

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
tradition, which
was all entirely

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
devoted to attaining
the light body

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
and ascending on
the Merkaba throne.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:84%
In this image here, it's derived
from the Book of Revelation,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.640 align:middle line:84%
where John the Revelator,
also an Essene initiate,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
described the holy of holies
of the Celestial City,

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
the new Jerusalem,
or Scion, which

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
was the target of the
Essene ascension mysteries.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to
transform their earthly flesh

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.190 align:middle line:84%
into celestial
flesh, so that they

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
could dwell in this
Celestial City, which

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:90%
they said was inhabited.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So on the left-hand side, we
see Mary on the Merkaba throne.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
We see John the Divine
holding a grail cup.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:10%
And on the right, we
see John the Revelator,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.110 align:middle line:10%
who is obviously in a state
of ecstasy or in a trance.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:10%
He's got an open book--

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:10%
the Book of Revelation.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's gone over the rainbow
bridge of consciousness.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's peering into this
higher dimensional realm.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.650 align:middle line:10%
He's having a vision or
a visionary experience

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:10%
of Scion or the new Jerusalem.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's entirely other worldly.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It's peopled by
extraordinary beings

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and also ascended humans.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:10%
So he crosses over the
rainbow, like Dorothy,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:10%
and he describes that
there was a throne of God--

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:10%
the Merkaba.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.970 align:middle line:10%
When the Essenes are ascending
to the throne of God,

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.130 align:middle line:10%
they're ascending
to the Merkaba,

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:10%
which exists in this
higher dimensional realm.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.960 align:middle line:84%
He describes servants
stood in a place

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:90%
of perpetual heavenly light.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Extraordinary description.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
"Dead Sea Scrolls,"

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were saying
part of their mission

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:84%
was to bathe Earth in
perpetual heavenly light.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Not to necessarily go somewhere,
but to transform Earth

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
into a planet of righteousness,
a higher frequency

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
planet that was bathed in
perpetual heavenly light.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And just let that roll
through your imagination,

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
what it would feel like if our
planet were suddenly bathed

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:90%
in perpetual heavenly light.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:10%
It'd be a completely
different world

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:10%
that we would be living in.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And so as John goes
over the rainbow,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:10%
he sees Christ enthroned
on the Merkaba,

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:10%
on the celestial throne
chariot with various beings--

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:10%
saintly beings, guitar players.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's Jimmy Page.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.560 align:middle line:90%
It's Jimi Hendrix.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:90%
It's gotta be, right?

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Eddie Van Halen, all with
their guitars in their hand.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.123 align:middle line:90%
They're rocking out.

00:10:08.123 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they're at
the throne of Christ.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
They've completed their
earthly ascension cycle.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:90%
They're over the rainbow.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And they are now in
the celestial Zion.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And so John in this image,
very much like you and I,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.740 align:middle line:84%
are actually present
in that throne.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at
this image of Christ.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%
We're tapping into it.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But Christ is also
looking back at us.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds
a little bit nuts,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.642 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to explain
how and why that is possible.

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:36.850 align:middle line:84%
As the Book of Hebrews says--
and the Book of Hebrews

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:90%
is an Essene ascension manual.

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:84%
It was meant to be rehearsed
over and over again.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes, like
later the Cathars,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
would use these texts
as guided visualizations

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
concretize the ascension

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:84%
journey in their
minds, so that they

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly what
was going to happen

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:90%
in their afterlife journey.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.480 align:middle line:90%
They had modeled it.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:84%
They had wired
their brain for it.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
They had connected
their soul to it.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So it was like me leaving this
room, walking out of the hotel,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.370 align:middle line:84%
catching the shuttle, going over
to LAX, and flying home, right?

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
That is essentially-- they would
rehearse the heavenly journey

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
over and over and over again,
until they absolutely embodied

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And they knew that once they
completed their ascension,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
that they would go to this
place that was populated by,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
as Hebrews says, innumerable
company of angels

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:90%
and just humans made perfect.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Just humans made perfect.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, who are these people?

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:90%
And how did they become perfect?

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.113 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:11:41.113 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you look up
the meaning of the word

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
"just," it means upright,
righteous, and balanced.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And just in this case
doesn't mean they're

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.840 align:middle line:90%
only humans made perfect.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:90%
They're just.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:90%
They're righteous.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.190 align:middle line:90%
They're holy people.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
They're humans, which means
they're a member of the species

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.118 align:middle line:90%
Homo sapien.

00:11:58.118 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:90%
And here's a punchline for you.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
They're not animal,
divine, or machine,

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.290 align:middle line:84%
which we won't get into
the AI aspect of this.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:90%
But can a transhuman ascend?

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:84%
According to this,
no, you cannot.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.890 align:middle line:84%
They're made, meaning
they're shaped or formed.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're perfect,
meaning they're complete.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.970 align:middle line:90%
They're fully developed.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
They're whole.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:90%
They're holy.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:90%
They're 360.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And they're effectively what
I would term "I am-plus."

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:90%
They are more than human.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
They are just
humans made perfect.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the Essene
tradition, this

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
is our goal, is to become
more whole, more holy, more

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.910 align:middle line:90%
complete, and indeed, perfect.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And I use the term 360,
because that comes from a text

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.320 align:middle line:90%
that the Essenes actually read.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
"Epic of Gilgamesh."

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the world's
second oldest story.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's
an ascension story

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
where an Iraqi king
named Gilgamesh

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:90%
is on his ascension path.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And he gets a lucky break when
the goddess Inanna comes to him

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and tells him, brother, you're
2/3 divine and 1/3 human.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you try to go through
the gate of the gods--

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.227 align:middle line:84%
which is his attempt in the
"Epic of Gilgamesh--" as 2/3

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
human and 1/3 divine,
it's going to be

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.977 align:middle line:90%
like walking into a blender.

00:13:15.977 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
your feathers ruffled.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
So what you want to do before
you go through that gate

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
is to clean up your act, to go
from 2/3 divine and 1/3 human

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:90%
to 360.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, if divinity is
symbolized by a circle--

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:90%
and a circle is 360 degrees.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:84%
If we're 2/3 human
and 1/3 divine,

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:41.680 align:middle line:84%
that means we start out
at about 240 out of 360.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And our quest then is to move
the needle to become 360.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that is by
changing what we're doing,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.310 align:middle line:84%
This was the message
to Gilgamesh.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.847 align:middle line:84%
But if he keeps doing the
same things that he's doing,

00:13:54.847 --> 00:13:56.930 align:middle line:84%
he's not going to be able
to get through the gate.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So all of us are charged in
our own personal experience

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to figure out, how can we
go from 240, 280, 290, 320,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.050 align:middle line:90%
to 360?

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And part of what
we have to do is

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
to begin to connect with a
vision of what our life will

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:90%
be like when we are at 360.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And for many of us, it's going
to be individually specific.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.100 align:middle line:84%
But there are also keys
that we get from ancient art

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and traditions that tells
us what a fully functioning

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.690 align:middle line:90%
human being actually can do.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things a fully
functioning human being can do

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
is adopt a consciousness
similar to that of Christ

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and to have superhuman
powers, ascension powers.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking at
here is a correspondence

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
between the Buddhist tradition
and the Christian tradition.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the Dalai Lama looking
up, visualizing his connection

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:90%
with Quan Yin.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So he's sitting in a state of
visualization or meditation,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
deep gamma, perhaps,
looking up at this orb

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:01.350 align:middle line:84%
of rainbow-colored light,
just exactly like John

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
the Revelator is,
crossing over the rainbow

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.660 align:middle line:84%
bridge of consciousness and
having a vision of Christ

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:90%
in the very same rainbow.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same scene.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And what this illustrates for
us is one form of practice

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
for awakening to
one's true nature

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.570 align:middle line:84%
in Buddhism that's highly
respected by Buddhists,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is connecting with the qualities
of an enlightened being,

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
one who is already awake
and then modeling what

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:31.470 align:middle line:84%
they are doing as an
example and an inspiration.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is what this
Dalai Lama is doing.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:84%
He is actually visualizing Quan
Yin in her ascended rainbow

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:90%
light body.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And he's contemplating,
meditating, and reflecting on,

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:10%
what is it that Quan Yin
has in her ascended state

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:10%
that I don't have?

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:10%
She's a 360 being.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:90%
She is "I am-plus."

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.320 align:middle line:90%
He isn't.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:90%
He's trying to get on this path.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And one key here is that
whenever the Dalai Lamas were

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:84%
taught how to attain this
elevated state of being,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
this rainbow light body, they
were never taught with texts.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.940 align:middle line:84%
There are no books you can
read about how to attain

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:90%
your rainbow light body.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lamas, instead, would
be taken out behind the Potala

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Palace when they were in Tibet
into a circular room that

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
is 360 degrees
covered with images.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were taught the rainbow
light body through images.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
This is because the higher
dimensional rainbow light

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
body beings could manifest
through those images

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
and connect with the
consciousness of the Dalai

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Lamas and perhaps give
them downloads or transmit

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
frequencies to them.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is why my emphasis is
on the art of living ascension.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the
art, the image that

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
shows us the way as the
"Gnostic Gospels" say.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a science, a sacred
science behind all of this

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to recover
and share in the modern world.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
In his book, the teaching
on Chenrezig sadhana,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
Kalu Rinpoche
said, "One does not

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:84%
think of the deity's body--"
in this case, Quan Yin--

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
"as solid or material
made of flesh and blood

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:15.180 align:middle line:84%
like one's ordinary body or made
of metal or stone like an idol.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
One thinks of it
as appearance that

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is inseparable from
emptiness like a rainbow

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.119 align:middle line:84%
or like a reflection
in a mirror."

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.829 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the key concepts here

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we are instructed
to look at Quan Yin

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
as if we are
looking in a mirror.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And then we are to mirror
what we are seeing, feeling,

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.480 align:middle line:90%
or otherwise experiencing.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
The image that's visualized
in this meditation

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
practice-- and this is
a meditation practice

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:90%
that I'm offering here.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
This is another
tool in your kit.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
No matter what
else you're doing--

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
yoga, meditation,
fasting, any other tool

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're using
to cleanse, purify,

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.260 align:middle line:84%
raise your frequency-- this
is another tool for your kit.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the image that's
visualized in the meditation

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.340 align:middle line:84%
practice is not
a real person who

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:84%
happens to be perfect
in every imaginable way.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It's an image.

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:84%
It's an image and
an imaginary form

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.680 align:middle line:84%
with certain
wonderful qualities.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.307 align:middle line:84%
She radiates
rainbow color light.

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And if she were to manifest
in this room right now

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.323 align:middle line:84%
and it was dark, she
would be glowing.

00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:21.240 align:middle line:90%
She would be luminous.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.513 align:middle line:84%
She'd be radiant, be
literally a being of light.

00:18:25.513 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm encouraging
you to do here--

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you'll take
out your cell phone,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.670 align:middle line:90%
take a quick photo--

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
is that this is one
way that you can

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:84%
connect with this vibration of
Quan Yin is through the image.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago, they
said the average person

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
looks at their cell
phone 200 times a day.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.150 align:middle line:90%
It's probably a lot more now.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And so just imagine
if half of that time,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
you're looking at
your starting screen

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:90%
on your phone or your computer.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And you're connecting
with Quan Yin,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.048 align:middle line:84%
just taking that moment
to reflect on that.

00:18:57.048 --> 00:18:58.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a
medical doctor that's

00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:59.632 align:middle line:90%
known me for a long time.

00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
She said, boy, you've really
changed in the past 10 years

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:90%
since I've known you.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:90%
And you've grown a lot lighter.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.405 align:middle line:90%
And how are you doing that?

00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I don't know.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:84%
I've just spent hours every day
staring at my computer screen,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%
working on presentations.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always connecting
with these beings.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that's-- what I'm
saying to you is working for me.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:90%
I hope so.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I will continue
to do it, right?

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm wanting
to suggest here

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
is that we can connect with
these higher dimensional beings

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:90%
through the image.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And this isn't me speaking.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to see is that
this story is told repeatedly

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.270 align:middle line:90%
throughout time.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
For at least 4,000,
5,000 years, they've

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
been talking, that
this is how we

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:90%
connect with the divine beings.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Art is the primary
and most direct

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
conduit that we can have
with these celestial beings.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So I've been very
fortunate as I've

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:84%
been going around giving
these presentations,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:84%
developing a reputation for
the art of ascension-type guy.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.420 align:middle line:10%
I have developed
wonderful contacts

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.070 align:middle line:10%
at Sotheby's, and Christie's,
and some of the major auction

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:10%
houses--

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:10%
Bonhams in London

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:10%
And these are places
where art flows

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:10%
through that will blow your
mind, that you will never see.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Because some of it has come
from private collections,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.345 align:middle line:10%
even in some monasteries.

00:20:17.345 --> 00:20:18.845 align:middle line:10%
And it goes into
private collections

00:20:18.845 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:10%
or wealthy collectors.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:10%
And we will have no idea
what's actually out there.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:10%
I can give you a taste of it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.333 align:middle line:10%
And some of these images that
I'm sharing with you today

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.500 align:middle line:10%
came from Sotheby's
and especially this one

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:10%
here, where we see
this bodhisattva

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:10%
in his twirling
rainbow light body gone

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.340 align:middle line:10%
into this-- the pure
land, connecting

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:10%
with other bodhisattvas.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
And we see this guy with
this red sash on him.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.162 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the
Tibetan mystic flyers.

00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:49.370 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans have this whole
tradition that all of us

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.030 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to fly if
we just would take the time

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:90%
to activate that ability.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.603 align:middle line:84%
It's a natural human
ability to be able to fly.

00:20:57.603 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what that
red sash indicates,

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
just as it's a
natural human ability

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
to be able to dissolve
our flesh and blood

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.920 align:middle line:84%
body into our celestial
body, our rainbow light body.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a caterpillar
morphs into a butterfly.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is hard wired
for this experience.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's our culture that tells
us, like the two caterpillars

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
I saw once in a cartoon, looking
up at a butterfly, saying,

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get me up
in one of those things.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.528 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
our culture says.

00:21:28.528 --> 00:21:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Who do you think you are?

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:90%
Perfect?

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:90%
What do you think you are?

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:90%
Perfect?

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
Nobody is perfect.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the constant
refrain of our culture.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've completely misaligned
the understanding of the word

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:90%
perfect to begin with.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It means whole, holy,
complete, and compassionate.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean perfect, like
we all understand it to mean.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
So everybody can become
more whole, more holy,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.280 align:middle line:84%
more complete, more
compassionate, and therefore,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
more perfect than
they presently are.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
And perfect light beings--

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the Essenes
called the ascended beings--

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.000 align:middle line:90%
perfect light humans.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The immovable race of
perfect light humans

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
was the distinction they had
for this extraterrestrial race.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we
see another example

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:84%
here of a bodhisattva,
possibly even Quan Yin,

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
in the rainbow light body with
this swirling energy radiating

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.270 align:middle line:90%
from her body.

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that happened in
my path that I love to share

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad to have an
opportunity to do so today

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.590 align:middle line:84%
is back in 2003, it was one
of my first visits to Egypt.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm on a cruise ship in Luxor.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just-- had this
mind-blowing experience

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt already.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The cruise director calls
me on the phone and says,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
we're ready for the
belly dancer now.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you come down?

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, oh,
man, I'm so tired.

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go see
a belly dancer tonight.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
The cruise guy called
me three times.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I'm like, OK, I'll
come watch the belly dancer.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And so I go into the lounge.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And here, it's not
a belly dancer.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a whirling dervish dancer.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And he's performing an
800-year-old mystic Islamic

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
dance where he takes his skirt.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.370 align:middle line:84%
He's spinning in place,
going into a deep state

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.660 align:middle line:90%
of meditation.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:90%
And he's spinning.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I hear this
crashing sound on the floor,

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:90%
and it's my jaw.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm thinking, that's
Elijah in the whirlwind.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.370 align:middle line:84%
That's all of these
biblical stories

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:84%
of Ezekiel going
up into the heavens

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.470 align:middle line:84%
in a spinning
wheel of some kind.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:28.118 align:middle line:84%
And he's turning his
body into this Merkaba.

00:23:28.118 --> 00:23:29.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what he's
demonstrating here.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very clear.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And then it gets
even more incredible

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:10%
when he takes out
his second skirt

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:10%
and starts spinning it in
a counterclockwise fashion.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And I realize, that's
the shape of a wormhole.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
He has just turned his
body into a wormhole, which

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely mind blowing.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And then afterword,
what happens is

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.670 align:middle line:84%
that his assistant
comes out, provides him

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.080 align:middle line:90%
with this linen shroud.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
He takes his second skirt,
wraps it into a bundle,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and then they wrap the linen
shroud around the bundle.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:90%
And they feed it milk.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, what's
the message for us?

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of the
message is, where did you

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.200 align:middle line:90%
come from, before you got here?

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you decide you're
going to leave here,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.500 align:middle line:90%
where are you going?

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And how are you
going to get there?

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is we
come through wormholes.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Sufi
tradition, which

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is the mystic Islamic
tradition going back 800 years,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.800 align:middle line:84%
they have this
incredible tradition

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
started by the poet Rumi
who is a Islamic mystic

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.080 align:middle line:84%
of these whirling dervishes,
who go into these trances

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.060 align:middle line:90%
and spin these--

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.070 align:middle line:84%
just scarves and
wrappings around them.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear that
what we're looking at

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.886 align:middle line:90%
is an Islamic version of what?

00:24:51.886 --> 00:24:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Activating the Merkaba.

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Activating the Merkaba,
the rainbow light body.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.780 align:middle line:84%
So we've just crossed over
from the Christian tradition

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
through the Tibetan
tradition into mystic Islam.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
telling the same thing.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.190 align:middle line:84%
Our body is capable
of being transformed

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.800 align:middle line:90%
into a higher or ascended form.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And we need to learn
how to do that.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And they've been encoding
it in their sacred art

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and in the Islamic tradition
and within a sacred dance.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.650 align:middle line:84%
This rainbow light
body is what we

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.970 align:middle line:84%
need to get more in touch
with on our ascension path.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
It is our true nature,
according to the Buddhists.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.530 align:middle line:90%
It's who we truly are.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Deep inside you is
this being of light.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:38.280 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow light body
isn't something you go get.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you already are,

00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that is covered over
by misperceptions,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
by negative thought forms,
by culture that says,

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:90%
you are actually just this, OK?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of
the matter is, is

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.870 align:middle line:84%
that all of these
sacred traditions

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
tell us that this
is who we truly are,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
this rainbow light
body being within us.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:90%
This is Padmasambhava.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.910 align:middle line:84%
He's a Tibetan guru,
came from India to Tibet

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:06.780 align:middle line:90%
in the 8th century.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:84%
He actually came from
some celestial realm.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.310 align:middle line:84%
What happened in my journey is
that I was at a UFO conference,

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.960 align:middle line:84%
not long after I
took those photos

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
I just showed you of the
whirling dervish dancer.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And a couple came
up to me and said

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.550 align:middle line:84%
they both had PhDs from the
Harvard Divinity School.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Their specialty is the
rainbow light body.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.370 align:middle line:84%
They translate Tibetan
text for the Dalai Lama.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.440 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing this
for a very long time,

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and that my work in
Egypt answered for them

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.272 align:middle line:84%
a question that the
Tibetans couldn't answer.

00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
know the answer

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
or wouldn't answer,
because it's secret.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And that was this.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me then
if I knew anything

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.408 align:middle line:90%
about the rainbow light body.

00:26:44.408 --> 00:26:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:84%
This was my first
introduction to it.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And they explained to
me that Padmasambhava

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.455 align:middle line:84%
came from the stars,
came to Tibet,

00:26:53.455 --> 00:26:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and taught this principle that
the human body is designed

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
to have its frequency
accelerated, until it dissolves

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:84%
into five-colored rainbow
light, leaving behind only hair,

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
toe, and fingernails, which
have no nerves to be transmuted.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'm blown away.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like, wow,
that's incredible.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And what does that have
to do with my work?

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
here's the thing.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
What the Tibetans teach is that
once we attain-- oh, excuse me,

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:90%
let me go back--

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the rainbow light body,
then we have the ability

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to travel to one of
12 other star systems

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:90%
where this teaching is taught.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And what this couple
wanted to know,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.445 align:middle line:84%
which was unknown or secret,
was, how do they get there?

00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:10%
Once they obtain the
rainbow light body

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:10%
and can travel to and from
these other star systems,

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.605 align:middle line:10%
how do they get there?

00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And then they said they're
watching my presentation

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:10%
on ancient Egyptian
starwalkers, where

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:10%
I was talking about the
ancient Egyptian starwalking

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.420 align:middle line:10%
in stargate imagery.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.832 align:middle line:10%
And they said that
was the answer,

00:27:49.832 --> 00:27:51.290 align:middle line:10%
that they've
actually-- are turning

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.747 align:middle line:10%
their body into a wormhole.

00:27:53.747 --> 00:27:56.330 align:middle line:84%
They opened the wormhole through
their body, beamed themselves

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.088 align:middle line:90%
to another star system.

00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they can take on
a flesh and blood body.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Once again, they can phase back
into a flesh and blood body

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:90%
if they choose to.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And the main justification
for choosing to do this

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
was that then they could be
like the greatest antenna

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.460 align:middle line:84%
or beamer of
compassion possible.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
reason for incarnating

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.300 align:middle line:90%
in a flesh and blood body.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:90%
So I'm blown away.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And this sends me off
on a whole new path

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
to match up the Tibetan
rainbow light body teachings

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.890 align:middle line:84%
with what I'm discovering
and researching

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.430 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and elsewhere.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to share
some of that with you

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.630 align:middle line:90%
as we continue.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:10%
But again, here's Padmasambhava
in his rainbow light body,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:10%
once again, making eye
to eye contact with us,

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:10%
present in the
room with us, just

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:46.080 align:middle line:10%
as we are present before
him at this very moment.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.360 align:middle line:90%
We are seeing him.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:90%
He is seeing us.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it's
so important that--

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I love it every time
I'm anywhere and I see,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:02.430 align:middle line:84%
especially a woman or a young
female, in her yoga outfit.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Because it tells me, hey,
there is real hope here.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.270 align:middle line:10%
Because suddenly, we've got
tens of millions of people

00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.900 align:middle line:10%
around the world practicing
yoga and meditation.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.400 align:middle line:10%
Whether they are
aware of it or not,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:10%
what they are actually
doing is morphing

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.340 align:middle line:10%
into their rainbow light body.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:10%
Every time they're doing yoga,
every time they're meditating,

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:10%
every time they're
setting that intention,

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.060 align:middle line:10%
they're actually calling
in their higher self,

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.585 align:middle line:10%
be it White Tara as
we see here, or Quan

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Yin, or any other divine
figure, even Mary.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
That is the ultimate
goal of that practice.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.020 align:middle line:10%
So it gives me great hope
that during this time,

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:10%
we are going to see some
incredible manifestations

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.850 align:middle line:10%
of the rainbow light body.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:10%
Because we're building this
incredible bubble of frequency

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.900 align:middle line:10%
around our planet where
people can tap into it.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And we are, perhaps, not just
the forerunners or wayshowers.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:84%
We could be the actual
exemplars for all

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.870 align:middle line:84%
of future humanity of
what is possible for us,

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
once we set ourselves
on becoming more

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
whole, holy, complete,
compassionate, perfect,

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.827 align:middle line:90%
and "I am-plus."

00:30:06.827 --> 00:30:08.910 align:middle line:10%
What you notice in this
image of White Tara, which

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:11.670 align:middle line:10%
is right over here
at LACMA, by the way,

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.355 align:middle line:10%
the LA County
Museum of Art, she's

00:30:13.355 --> 00:30:15.480 align:middle line:10%
got her rainbow britches on.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So she's obviously in
her rainbow light body.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And she's wearing
her red sash that

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:90%
indicates that she can fly.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And she is an exemplar of
a whole, holy, complete, or

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.650 align:middle line:90%
perfected being.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:84%
According to
Buddhism, each of us

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.660 align:middle line:84%
holds within us an
exhaustless source

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.090 align:middle line:90%
of compassion and wisdom.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
how do we tap into that?

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:45.430 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is to connect
with our most essential nature,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:90%
they tell us.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:47.688 align:middle line:84%
And that is our
rainbow light body.

00:30:47.688 --> 00:30:49.577 align:middle line:90%
That is our true self.

00:30:49.577 --> 00:30:51.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's been covered
over, as I said,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.470 align:middle line:84%
by negative emotions, false
perceptions, and especially,

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:90%
culture.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:90%
Here's a key.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.300 align:middle line:84%
According to Hindu
Buddhist thought,

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.280 align:middle line:84%
everything that we see around
us is maya or illusion.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:90%
It's maya or illusion.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.590 align:middle line:84%
How do we overcome
maya or illusion?

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The way I offer
as an explanation

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:17.130 align:middle line:84%
or a positive pathway
is through this--

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.010 align:middle line:84%
12 lines projected
on a screen that's

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
brought to life in
your imagination

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.670 align:middle line:84%
as a three-dimensional
cube, right?

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.730 align:middle line:84%
That's what it really
is, taking a step back.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So if this
three-dimensional cube

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is 12 lines projected
on a screen brought

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.090 align:middle line:84%
to life in your imagination,
then what is the chair

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.192 align:middle line:90%
you're sitting on?

00:31:37.192 --> 00:31:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> The same thing.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>> The same thing.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.440 align:middle line:84%
What is the apple you just
took a big bite out of?

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.240 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection of atoms,
molecules, energy and motion,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
all brought to life
in our imagination.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.060 align:middle line:10%
So if everything is brought
to life in our imagination,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.182 align:middle line:10%
then this cube also gives
us another valuable insight.

00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:58.890 align:middle line:10%
Because as you can
see, if you look at it

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:10%
from one perspective,
it looks like you're

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:10%
looking into the cube, right?

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.080 align:middle line:10%
Then if you shift
your perspective,

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.690 align:middle line:10%
now it looks like you're
looking down into the cube.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And a completely
different box appears.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.620 align:middle line:10%
Can you you all see
it shift or jump?

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:14.700 align:middle line:84%
But to me, this cube
demonstrates or shows us the

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.410 align:middle line:84%
only two ways that we
perceive everything out here.

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Every single moment of our
lives, we're bringing things--

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.730 align:middle line:84%
what's out here to life
in our imagination.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.500 align:middle line:90%
And we're making a choice.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to put fear
into what we're experiencing?

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to put love
into what we are experiencing?

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Those are the only two choices
we have every single moment

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And so if love, peace, joy,
happiness, wholeness, holiness,

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.105 align:middle line:84%
perfection, 360, "I
am-plus" is our goal.

00:32:45.105 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're down here going, well,
I'm not sure if I can do that.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, I've got an appointment
in five minutes-- or whatever.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
get there, right?

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the golden rule
says what we put out

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.810 align:middle line:90%
is what we get back.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So our goal-- and
this is, I think,

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.970 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
reasons why we incarnate

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.880 align:middle line:84%
on Earth is it's a sort of
a cosmic kindergarten for us

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to manifest or
understand this principle

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful our
thoughts and emotions are.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Because as we've noticed, our
world is accelerating, right?

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.535 align:middle line:10%
And if you can't handle your
emotions now, what do you think

00:33:19.535 --> 00:33:20.910 align:middle line:10%
is going to happen
in a few years

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.740 align:middle line:10%
when we're screaming
down the highway?

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:10%
This is why this is so important
for us to get a handle on.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:10%
Because the idea is that as
we expand in our awareness

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness, our
three-dimensional cube

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.990 align:middle line:10%
which represents our
world becomes the core

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.210 align:middle line:10%
of a fourth-dimensional
hypercube

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:10%
with all kinds of
parallel worlds

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:10%
suddenly impinging on our
consciousness and all kinds

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.530 align:middle line:10%
of opportunities for expanding
our consciousness being

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.670 align:middle line:10%
presented to ourselves.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:10%
Does that makes sense?

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:10%
So this is where many of us
are already at right now.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:90%
We've transcended the 3D world.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going into
the 4D and five 3D world.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
the pioneers that

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:05.820 align:middle line:84%
are mastering the power of
their thought and emotion

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing the illusory
nature of our world.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You've heard of living
outside the box.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:18.540 align:middle line:84%
The ascended beings live as
if there is no box, right?

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.560 align:middle line:90%
That's the big flip.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.120 align:middle line:84%
That's one way
you will know when

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:84%
you have accomplished
your ascension is you're

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:90%
no longer living in the box.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.219 align:middle line:84%
So to the question-- when
did this illusion begin?

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, Buddhism teaches
that the second we

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.620 align:middle line:10%
veiled our pure Buddha nature,
our rainbow light body,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.750 align:middle line:10%
with a fundamental
mistake, the notion of "I,"

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.110 align:middle line:10%
and separated ourselves
from everything out here,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.847 align:middle line:10%
that's when the illusion began.

00:34:41.847 --> 00:34:43.139 align:middle line:10%
That's when the illusion began.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.630 align:middle line:10%
We are taught, I am
separate from this stage,

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:10%
from this chair, from my
computer, and so forth.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.760 align:middle line:10%
But really, we're
all the same thing.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:10%
All indeed one.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Creation is happening
at every single second.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And that is what starts
to give us some--

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:84%
if I can use the word control
or ability to navigate

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:90%
this illusory realm.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.683 align:middle line:84%
In the Buddhist view, there
are three kinds of dreams--

00:35:09.683 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:84%
the dream of
nighttime, which ends

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:84%
with daylight, the
dream of Earth lifetime,

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.840 align:middle line:84%
which ends with death, and the
dream of ignorance or samsara,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.090 align:middle line:90%
which ends with enlightenment.

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is our
goal-- enlightenment

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and ascension are
essentially synonymous.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.120 align:middle line:10%
The way out is to wake
up completely returned

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.420 align:middle line:10%
to our true nature as
rainbow light body beings

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:10%
as it was in the
original beginning,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.580 align:middle line:10%
before the "I" separated us
from everything out here.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:40.800 align:middle line:10%
And we became deeply
lost or enmeshed

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:10%
in this illusory world.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.960 align:middle line:10%
And there are many ways
to remind ourselves

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:10%
of our true nature of our
rainbow light body selves.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Among them are meditation,
prayers, recitation of mantras,

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
construction of inspiring
or sacred places,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.300 align:middle line:84%
visiting sacred places, which
is why my wife Claire and I

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.950 align:middle line:84%
love taking people to
England, Italy, France, Egypt.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:11.280 align:middle line:10%
Going to Israel later this
year to walk in these paths.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.310 align:middle line:10%
Because we know that connecting
with these sacred places

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:15.690 align:middle line:10%
feeds our light body.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.718 align:middle line:10%
That's why we go, right?

00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:19.260 align:middle line:10%
It's not to have a
wonderful holiday.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's to feed our souls
and awaken our light body.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But above all,
according to Buddhism,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the number one way
to remind yourself

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of your true nature,
your light body self,

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:35.370 align:middle line:90%
is meditation on sacred images.

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:36.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not my opinion.

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:39.430 align:middle line:10%
This is what the Buddhism--
teaching a very long time.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.730 align:middle line:10%
So for example, this image
of the standing Buddha

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.080 align:middle line:10%
is a good example
where the Buddha

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:10%
has got his palm open to you,
transmitting frequencies,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.290 align:middle line:10%
vibrations of your
true nature to you.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.560 align:middle line:84%
In the yogic tradition,
they call this ekagrata,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:00.420 align:middle line:84%
or one pointedness
meditation on sacred images.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.210 align:middle line:90%
When the devotee-- you and I--

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:08.100 align:middle line:84%
places our self before a sacred
image, the task of the devotee

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.450 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize the
illusory division between us

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
and the deity ourselves and
to transcend that illusion.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:23.280 align:middle line:10%
And in so doing, we are
connected with the Buddha.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.170 align:middle line:10%
And when we
single-mindedly contemplate

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.660 align:middle line:10%
on the magnificence
of the Buddha's image,

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.420 align:middle line:10%
we are practicing,
as I said, ekagrata.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this
repeatedly over time,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the image of the Buddha
stays constantly in our mind.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:10%
We are rewiring
our brain to match

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.240 align:middle line:10%
the frequency of the Buddha.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.070 align:middle line:10%
This is how they would do it.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:10%
No texts involved, just simple
contemplation, meditation,

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.340 align:middle line:10%
and reflection on the
image of the Buddha

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.850 align:middle line:10%
until your brain is so
connected with that,

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.190 align:middle line:10%
that you actually become it.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:84%
How much easier do
you want it to be?

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.620 align:middle line:84%
Who needs to sit in
a cave for 40 years?

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.420 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You just need to get the right
images in your consciousness

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and rewire your
brain to match what

00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.930 align:middle line:90%
we are seeing in these images.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:13.262 align:middle line:90%
This is a major practice.

00:38:13.262 --> 00:38:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetans actually--
they call it merit.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:19.770 align:middle line:84%
You're getting merit every time
you look at a sacred image.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:84%
If you finance a sacred image,
if you visit a sacred place,

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:26.290 align:middle line:84%
you're gaining merit,
both in this life

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and in future incarnations,
wherever that may be.

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists also teach
that to achieve illumination

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
or experience Buddha
nature, we must

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.360 align:middle line:84%
meditate on the
blue pearl, which

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.980 align:middle line:90%
is here in our pineal gland.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.253 align:middle line:84%
They call it the jewel in
the heart of the lotus.

00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:43.045 align:middle line:84%
This is the meaning of
the Buddhist mantra,

00:38:43.045 --> 00:38:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Om mani padme hum.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Om mani padme hum,
which is a mantra

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that you can chant as you are
meditating on these images.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.043 align:middle line:10%
This one here comes from
the "Hutchinson Collection"

00:38:55.043 --> 00:38:56.085 align:middle line:10%
at Ohio State University.

00:38:56.085 --> 00:38:58.930 align:middle line:10%
It's, I think, one of the
most remarkable images

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:10%
of Padmasambhava and
the rainbow light body.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we clearly
see the blue pearl

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.270 align:middle line:84%
or the blue apple in the
third eye in the pineal gland.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.330 align:middle line:10%
And meditating on this image
while chanting, om mani padme

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.810 align:middle line:10%
hum calls in those
divine blessings,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:10%
and connects you even more
deeply with Padmasambhava,

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.830 align:middle line:10%
and opens up a channel
for him to assist you

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.985 align:middle line:10%
in awakening and manifesting
your rainbow light body,

00:39:25.985 --> 00:39:29.030 align:middle line:10%
so I love that image.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And there you see the blue pearl
highlighted in the third eye.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland, of course,
is called the seat of the soul.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It's thought of as--

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a manufacturing plant
of sacred oils, secretions

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.245 align:middle line:84%
that contain the
secrets of transmuting

00:39:44.245 --> 00:39:45.980 align:middle line:90%
the body into light.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's the
emphasis on the pineal gland

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and awakening its capability to
transmute our physical flesh.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.370 align:middle line:84%
You're familiar with this
state of being I'm describing.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.360 align:middle line:84%
You ever see the movie,
"The Wizard of Oz?"

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.160 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:90%
Dorothy goes up in a vortex.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.557 align:middle line:84%
She's in a dream to
begin with, right?

00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:06.640 align:middle line:90%
She goes up in the vortex.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And she's in a place called Oz.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly out of the blue,
comes this orb of light.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:15.760 align:middle line:10%
And within this
orb of light, she

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:10%
begins to detect this
luminous humanoid figure,

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.610 align:middle line:10%
the good witch, Glinda, who's
wearing a cloak of light.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.040 align:middle line:10%
She's got a resurrection
or star stick in her hand.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.140 align:middle line:10%
And she's wearing a crown.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:33.160 align:middle line:10%
She is dressed exactly
like Padmasambhava

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:10%
in his rainbow light body,
who holds the resurrection

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:10%
stick that opens the
gates of heaven and hell.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:41.430 align:middle line:10%
His crown, his vajra,
and his heart chakra--

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.340 align:middle line:10%
they're identical.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
identical in exactly that

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:90%
what they're able to do.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.130 align:middle line:84%
They can phase in between their
physical flesh and blood cells

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and their light body selves.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.472 align:middle line:90%
And so can you.

00:40:55.472 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:84%
You'll never get me up
on one of those, though,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:90%
is what our culture says.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's the gap
we have to close.

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to say,
well, wait a minute.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.870 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we, in fact, can do this.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is what is reflected
in Buddhist art where they say,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.810 align:middle line:84%
we're always connected
to our true selves,

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.630 align:middle line:84%
to our pure self, our whole,
holy, and complete self.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It's always there in
our consciousness.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:84%
This, in fact, comes from
the Dalai Lama secret temple.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The Rubin Museum in Manhattan
and Chelsea in New York

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
actually has a recreation
of that temple.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Or it's not on display now, but
periodically, it's on display.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of those
images that the Dalai Lamas

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.320 align:middle line:84%
would be instructed
in, in this rainbow

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.960 align:middle line:84%
bridge that links
our consciousness

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.540 align:middle line:90%
with our true self.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful,
another example

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:49.405 align:middle line:84%
of a living image that connects
us with our true selves.

00:41:49.405 --> 00:41:53.092 align:middle line:90%


00:41:53.092 --> 00:41:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Flipping back to the
Christian tradition,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.765 align:middle line:84%
we find this story of
John the Revelator who

00:41:56.765 --> 00:42:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is visited by an angel who
came down out of heaven,

00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.520 align:middle line:90%
says the Book of Revelation.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:10%
The heavens open all
the time in the Bible.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.723 align:middle line:10%
And I think those are
stargate and wormhole events.

00:42:07.723 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:10%
So this angel comes
out of heaven,

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:11.780 align:middle line:10%
morphs into a flesh
and blood form

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.180 align:middle line:10%
that can be seen or perceived.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.460 align:middle line:10%
He's clothed with a cloud and
a rainbow around his head.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.960 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why, but I'm the
first person in all of history

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.480 align:middle line:10%
to connect the angel that
John the Revelator saw

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:10%
with the rainbow
light body beings.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:84%
I think they're the
exact same type of being.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They're in the same
state of being.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And he comes out of heaven,
this rainbow angel does.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:10%
And he's got a book
for John to eat.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I take tremendous
comfort in this story

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of John the Revelator
in this image.

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Because what it tells
me is that I don't

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.330 align:middle line:90%
have to do this all by myself.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I have my higher self.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And we could argue that
this rainbow angel is John

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:53.900 align:middle line:90%
the Revelator's higher self.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Or there are beings that are
out there in our universe who

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:90%
have already accomplished this.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And they are looking for
you and me to assist us

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.580 align:middle line:90%
in completing our ascension.

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to write the
book on the rainbow light body

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.110 align:middle line:90%
within every detail.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:16.970 align:middle line:84%
These beings who have already
done it are the experts at it.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're out
there looking for us.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.380 align:middle line:90%
It's like we're the--

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:22.343 align:middle line:90%
we got our light bulbs up here.

00:43:22.343 --> 00:43:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And for the most part,
none of our light bulbs

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.630 align:middle line:90%
are screwed in, right?

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.085 align:middle line:84%
But some of us have been
screwing in the light bulb.

00:43:29.085 --> 00:43:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're about to rake up
enough energy within ourselves

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:90%
where, bing.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.430 align:middle line:90%
The light lights up.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.020 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
rainbow angels come in

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and say, OK, put out your hand.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Literally putting
the-- completing

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of ascension
in the palm of our hand.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That story is repeated over
and over and over again

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.670 align:middle line:84%
in ascension stories, that
the person in the story--

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Enoch, for example--
pre-flood scholar,

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.560 align:middle line:84%
was just like you and I,
attended a lot of seminars,

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.360 align:middle line:90%
went to--

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.600 align:middle line:84%
watched ancient aliens
or did all this work

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.950 align:middle line:90%
and has pieced it all together.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:90%
It's like, oh, bing.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm screwing my light bulb in.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:10.400 align:middle line:10%
And then all of a sudden,
the Archangel Michael

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.085 align:middle line:10%
appears and says, OK,
Enoch, you've hit the books.

00:44:13.085 --> 00:44:14.960 align:middle line:84%
You know enough where
I'm not going to-- it's

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.335 align:middle line:84%
not going to be
dangerous for you

00:44:16.335 --> 00:44:18.350 align:middle line:84%
or harmful for you to
go on this journey.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Michael takes him up
through several heavens.

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:22.790 align:middle line:84%
They take him up to
the third heaven, which

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:27.230 align:middle line:84%
could be another dimension--
anoints Enoch's body with oil

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
so that now Enoch's
body in the story

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.490 align:middle line:84%
dissolves into
rainbow-colored light,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.000 align:middle line:84%
so that his body matches
that of the angels.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:84%
You mean there's an oil that can
transmute our body into light?

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Call Gary Young
and Young Living.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's get on this.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's start making
this oil right now.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I love
your Thieves drops.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:90%
I drink it by the gallon.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:84%
I love everything, but
what we really need

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.920 align:middle line:90%
is a resurrection oil, right?

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.880 align:middle line:90%
Where do you get that?

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.730 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] process.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And Gary is in his
rainbow body now.

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.020 align:middle line:90%
He's probably laughing at me.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, is
that in these stories,

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.980 align:middle line:84%
they tell us how it's done,
and that we're never alone

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:90%
on this path.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And so what then happens, of
course, to finish Enoch's story

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.100 align:middle line:90%
is he goes up to heaven.

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.178 align:middle line:84%
And God talks with him
and says, oh, yeah.

00:45:15.178 --> 00:45:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you hang
around for a little bit?

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a job.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.610 align:middle line:90%
You'll be a janitor.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:84%
You sweep up around
the throne, Enoch.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's Enoch does
for about 30 days

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.950 align:middle line:90%
while he's educated as well.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:28.567 align:middle line:84%
Then it's time for
him to come back.

00:45:28.567 --> 00:45:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And people think, oh,
that's a terrible job.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Who wants to be a janitor
at the throne of God?

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.125 align:middle line:90%
How do I apply?

00:45:37.125 --> 00:45:37.925 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:37.925 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And so Enoch comes
back to Earth.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Then he's taken back up again.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And now, he's given a
new name and a new job.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:47.620 align:middle line:90%
His new name is Metatron.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And his new job
is he's the guide.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It's Metatron who's
looking for you.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.060 align:middle line:90%
He's way up.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I just saw that bulb.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.990 align:middle line:84%
He got that little more
twist there and up it goes.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to-- yeah,
they're looking for us.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to reach
up to them, just as they're

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:07.020 align:middle line:84%
going to come down
to us and assist us

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.210 align:middle line:90%
in completing our ascension.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.010 align:middle line:84%
This teaching-- and
it was the Essenes

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.780 align:middle line:90%
who wrote the story of Enoch.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.170 align:middle line:84%
This was another one of
their rewire the brain

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.120 align:middle line:90%
visualization techniques.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again, they would
rehearse this story of Enoch

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:23.670 align:middle line:90%
going up and being transformed.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like to have
that oil running down your body

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.380 align:middle line:84%
and your body dissolving
into rainbow-colored light,

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:31.150 align:middle line:90%
so you're just like the angels?

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:84%
They'd rehearse, rehearse,
rehearse, rehearse this

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:39.270 align:middle line:84%
until it was a physical
reality within their own body.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:10%
This teaching is referred
to in the "Dead Sea

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.670 align:middle line:10%
Scrolls" as the perfect
way, perfection of holiness,

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:48.000 align:middle line:10%
perfect holiness, walking
in the way of perfection.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was given to the Essenes
by these other worldly beings

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.280 align:middle line:10%
who were referred
to in the scrolls

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.770 align:middle line:10%
as the heavenly holy
ones, sons of heaven,

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:59.820 align:middle line:10%
holy angels of the
Lord, or perfect ones.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Why are they called
the perfect ones?

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, because they're in
their rainbow light body,

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.500 align:middle line:90%
their perfect light body.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that is the goal
of human evolution

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:84%
is for us to transform
our planet into a planet

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.900 align:middle line:90%
of holiness and righteousness.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis tried
and failed, right?

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.760 align:middle line:90%
That whole story?

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.390 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans,
according to Plato,

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.700 align:middle line:90%
were hybrids of the gods.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.602 align:middle line:84%
They had a divine
element within them.

00:47:26.602 --> 00:47:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But then they
started to ignore it.

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.190 align:middle line:84%
They behaved
righteously for a while.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:10%
Then they said, oh, we
knew that-- oh, that

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.285 align:middle line:10%
righteousness crap.

00:47:33.285 --> 00:47:34.085 align:middle line:90%
I won't come out.

00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:36.190 align:middle line:84%
It's much more fun
to be naughty, right?

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Then that's what
they started to do.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And that divine element faded.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Zeus is watching
from high above.

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, OK,
here's the flood.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:46.880 align:middle line:90%
See you all later.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.680 align:middle line:90%
You blew it.

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:50.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the story
of Atlantis, right?

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.340 align:middle line:84%
The key story or key aspect
of the Atlantean mythos

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.610 align:middle line:84%
is they lost touch with
their divine element

00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:00.220 align:middle line:90%
and their righteous true selves.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And an entity, Zeus,
said enough's enough.

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:07.040 align:middle line:84%
We're going to wipe you
out, start all over again.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes are living
in the aftermath of this.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.690 align:middle line:84%
8,000 years after
the flood, humanity

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:14.530 align:middle line:90%
is getting its act together.

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, oh, OK.

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.600 align:middle line:84%
We've survived the
flood, the cataclysm.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.580 align:middle line:90%
We're still on this planet.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're calling in
these high celestial beings,

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.605 align:middle line:84%
saying, please, let
us try to regroup

00:48:26.605 --> 00:48:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and make this happen again.

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is what was going
on with the Essenes is

00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that these angels then
came down and delivered

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.550 align:middle line:84%
the heavenly secret, the mystery
that enabled them to transmute

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.430 align:middle line:84%
their earthly flesh
into celestial flesh

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.130 align:middle line:90%
and leave the planet.

00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:45.460 align:middle line:10%
Jesus was their
primary exemplar who

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.490 align:middle line:10%
accomplished-- went through
this whole earthly cycle.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So the Essenes sought this
bodily and spiritual perfection

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.720 align:middle line:84%
in order to cross over a veil or
boundary to the Celestial City,

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to Scion, the new Jerusalem,
their term for the pure land

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.330 align:middle line:84%
and to commune
with these beings,

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.790 align:middle line:84%
to stand united with
the angels before God,

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and to live in a state of,
as they say in the scrolls,

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:09.910 align:middle line:90%
perfect light for all eternity.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Anybody interested?

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, me, too.

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:16.578 align:middle line:90%
This is what it's all about.

00:49:16.578 --> 00:49:17.620 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're using.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Every precious moment in this
gift of life that we have

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.700 align:middle line:84%
is to accomplish this
very thing, right?

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.710 align:middle line:84%
You can accumulate all
the wealth with you.

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But, brother, you're not going
to take it with you, right?

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the true treasure
that we're all seeking.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is the time when
there's a thought form that's

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:39.010 align:middle line:90%
being built around it.

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Our yoga goddesses are clearing
the way for us-- and gods,

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:42.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Or dakinis.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And now, it's up to us to take
that next step and to say, OK,

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:84%
I think these
practices make sense.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.370 align:middle line:90%
Does this all make sense to you?

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so I'm going
to start visualizing.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start rewiring
my brain to the frequency

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.720 align:middle line:90%
of the rainbow light body.

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do that
through images, because this

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.830 align:middle line:90%
is how the ancients did it.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:04.630 align:middle line:90%
It worked for them.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.562 align:middle line:84%
And I think it could
work for me, too.

00:50:06.562 --> 00:50:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go
along this path.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
start to utilize

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.920 align:middle line:90%
the art of living ascension.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring these
frequencies into my being

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.270 align:middle line:90%
through these images.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, what the Tibetans
teach is that we

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.270 align:middle line:10%
in the image of Padmasambhava
are two extremes.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:26.170 align:middle line:84%
We have flesh and blood bodies,
but not as much compassion

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.540 align:middle line:90%
as we would like to have.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava has all the
compassion in the world,

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.100 align:middle line:84%
but he doesn't have a
flesh and blood body.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we put these
two extremes together

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.230 align:middle line:84%
while meditating on this image
of the rainbow light body,

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.780 align:middle line:84%
we move in the
direction of manifesting

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.720 align:middle line:84%
as a being with a flesh
and blood body, and more

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
compassion, and maybe
a few rainbows thrown

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:53.310 align:middle line:90%
in just for decoration, right?

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Our goal for now is
just to merge those two

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.265 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to
make those steps.

00:51:00.265 --> 00:51:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of you
might say, well,

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.973 align:middle line:90%
I'm not really into small steps.

00:51:02.973 --> 00:51:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
go all the way.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm right here
to support you, OK?

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we are--
there's a lot of people

00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:84%
that are on this ascension path
that are working on this, OK?

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And there may be some that
have got that light bulb really

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:90%
bright at this moment.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And they will actually be
able to go full rainbow light

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:22.640 align:middle line:90%
body for us.

00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:24.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that is the
definition of the messiah.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.250 align:middle line:84%
When the Christ or messiah
comes at the Second Coming,

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:29.320 align:middle line:90%
this will happen on CNN and Fox.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:31.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, right on
the Temple Mount.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:84%
That is one of the-- it's
on the checklist or to-do

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:90%
list of the messiah.

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So when people like Kanye West--
not to take a shot at Kanye,

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.810 align:middle line:84%
but he does believe
he's the messiah.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.980 align:middle line:84%
My advice to Kanye is start
working on your rainbow light

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.780 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.072 align:middle line:90%
And it turns out he already is.

00:51:46.072 --> 00:51:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I wrote an article
on my website--

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.954 align:middle line:90%
williamhenry.net.

00:51:48.954 --> 00:51:51.582 align:middle line:84%
Someone-- I took a
picture of myself--

00:51:51.582 --> 00:51:53.290 align:middle line:84%
not of myself, but I
was at Thanksgiving.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.800 align:middle line:84%
I was in Paradise
Valley, Arizona at the--

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.330 align:middle line:84%
oh, what was the
name of that place?

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:90%
The Biltmore Resort.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.000 align:middle line:84%
stained glass window
of a rainbow imagery.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so, as with my wife,
Claire, my best friend, Susan,

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I said, hey, take
my picture here.

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:12.910 align:middle line:90%
So I'd take this picture.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And I put it up on Instagram.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, this
guy writes to me and says,

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Kanye West reads your
work and so does Eminem.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And their songs are all
about the rainbow light body.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I beg your pardon?

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:33.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, you know
about the 144,000, right?

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, yeah, there's
people on Facebook, a group.

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:39.760 align:middle line:84%
144,000 lightworkers
and all that.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.643 align:middle line:90%
So I dig into it.

00:52:40.643 --> 00:52:42.060 align:middle line:84%
This is what my
articles is about.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The 144,000 are taught
the new song of the Lord.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.840 align:middle line:90%
The new song.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And what this person
said was the new song

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that the 144,000 know is the
frequency of the rainbow light

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.100 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And their mission-- the
144,000 will be on Earth

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:05.260 align:middle line:84%
when the beast appears at the
time of the Second Coming.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm of the
opinion that the beast

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.870 align:middle line:84%
is AI and this
beastly technology

00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're unleashing
on humanity right now.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And that means maybe
the 144,000 are also

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.380 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, because
they are the ones who

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.410 align:middle line:90%
will overcome the beast.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And they overcome the beast
by singing the new song

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.590 align:middle line:84%
manifesting the
rainbow light body.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Kanye West has
started a new choir

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:38.430 align:middle line:84%
as the messiah in his mind
to teach the new song.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:39.780 align:middle line:90%
That gets me excited.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.170 align:middle line:90%
So I'm thinking, you go, man.

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.010 align:middle line:90%
You go.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:44.890 align:middle line:84%
But just so long as he knows
that to go full messiah,

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:46.990 align:middle line:84%
he's going to have to
stand on the Temple Mount

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and go full rainbow light body.

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Demonstrate the power
of resurrection.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that his
church service?

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon me?

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.177 align:middle line:84%
That's his Sunday
church services.

00:53:55.177 --> 00:53:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's his Sunday
church services.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:01.800 align:middle line:84%
So imagine that we're
just like Padmasambhava

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.740 align:middle line:84%
or imagine that that's
not wishful thinking.

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that we're not
trying to turn ourselves

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.000 align:middle line:84%
into a supercomputer
or a Learjet, right?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to awaken
something that is already

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.530 align:middle line:84%
within us that's already
there and to then

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:21.940 align:middle line:90%
realize our full potential.

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of
this meditation is

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.540 align:middle line:84%
to help us to realize
that to become conscious

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.870 align:middle line:84%
of that internal aspect, that
true nature of ourselves.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the purpose
of the art and science

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.800 align:middle line:90%
of living ascension.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.740 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the Tibetans
teach that just seeing

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:43.970 align:middle line:10%
images of the rainbow body
activates our own glory body.

00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Just seeing the images.

00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And we practice activating our
light body by contemplating,

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:53.980 align:middle line:84%
meditating, reflecting on
the images presented here.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I spend so
much time and, actually, a lot

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:01.100 align:middle line:84%
of money as well, trying to
bring these images to you,

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.010 align:middle line:84%
trying to find the ones that
will help you to activate

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:05.260 align:middle line:90%
your own light body.

00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier,
it just drives me crazy

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:10.850 align:middle line:84%
thinking what other
images are out there

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.920 align:middle line:84%
in private collections
that we don't know about?

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I know there's some really
powerful ones out there.

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.200 align:middle line:84%
But whether you like
Padmasambhava or Jesus

00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the Christ, they all
are demonstrating for us

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:28.880 align:middle line:84%
this sacred state of being that
is within us, our true selves.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Call it the Christ self.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Call it our rainbow light body.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, something that
you want to notice

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:10%
in these images of
Padmasambhava is

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.780 align:middle line:10%
the symbols that are presented.

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:41.730 align:middle line:10%
He sits on a lotus throne.

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.400 align:middle line:10%
He's got his resurrection stick.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.350 align:middle line:10%
He's got his crown of glory.

00:55:45.350 --> 00:55:49.620 align:middle line:10%
He's got his vajra, which is the
Tibetan symbol for compassion

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:50.420 align:middle line:10%
and action.

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.580 align:middle line:10%
He holds it at the
level of the heart.

00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:54.950 align:middle line:10%
And he's got golden or
rainbow-colored rays

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:56.630 align:middle line:10%
coming off of his body.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:01.040 align:middle line:84%
These are probably
not actual devices

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:02.120 align:middle line:90%
that he brought with him.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I think they're symbols.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I think the resurrection
stick is our spinal cord.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:08.270 align:middle line:90%
It's our stairway to heaven.

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:10.310 align:middle line:84%
The crown is obviously
our crown chakra.

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:12.740 align:middle line:90%
The vajra is our heart chakra.

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And the rainbow body
is our true nature.

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:19.297 align:middle line:84%
Look at the Christian images
of Jesus and his resurrection

00:56:19.297 --> 00:56:20.097 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:56:20.097 --> 00:56:21.680 align:middle line:90%
He's got his resurrection stick.

00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.000 align:middle line:10%
He's got his crown.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.710 align:middle line:10%
He's got his vajra.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:26.840 align:middle line:10%
And he's got rainbow rays.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.140 align:middle line:10%
They're in the exact
same state of being.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus gave a
very important teaching

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.820 align:middle line:90%
on perfection.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.740 align:middle line:84%
This is Salvador
Dali's "Last Supper."

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.120 align:middle line:10%
And it's a wonderful painting
of Jesus for many reasons,

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.210 align:middle line:10%
including that when
we look in the detail,

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:48.290 align:middle line:10%
we see him with this rainbow
light coming off his body.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.550 align:middle line:10%
He's phasing.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.250 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he's in an
interphasic realm.

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:55.850 align:middle line:10%
He's not fully physical, nor is
he fully in his rainbow body.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:58.280 align:middle line:10%
But he's clearly
demonstrating that.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.035 align:middle line:10%
And in his teaching
on perfection,

00:57:00.035 --> 00:57:01.410 align:middle line:10%
Jesus says, I tell
you the truth.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:04.130 align:middle line:10%
It's hard for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, I tell you,
it's easier for a camel

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:07.970 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
eye of a needle

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:10.880 align:middle line:84%
than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of God.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.510 align:middle line:84%
The eye of the needle, of
course, is the portal, right?

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:15.980 align:middle line:90%
It's the gateway.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he's saying
here is that, brother,

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:20.780 align:middle line:84%
your physical flesh
and blood body

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.743 align:middle line:84%
is not going through
the eye of the needle.

00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:25.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how many times
you watch the movie "Stargate"

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.702 align:middle line:90%
or "Contact."

00:57:26.702 --> 00:57:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of heaven.

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You need to want it.

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would say
that to Elon Musk, too.

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Brother, you're trying
to go move to Mars,

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.263 align:middle line:84%
but this body is not
going to go live there.

00:57:36.263 --> 00:57:37.430 align:middle line:90%
NASA already has known that.

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:39.227 align:middle line:90%
They've known this since 1962.

00:57:39.227 --> 00:57:41.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
follow Elon Musk to Mars,

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:42.727 align:middle line:84%
that means you're
going to turn yourself

00:57:42.727 --> 00:57:45.275 align:middle line:90%
into a robot or a light being.

00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I've written to Elon Musk on
his Twitter page, saying, hey,

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:50.660 align:middle line:84%
man, how about sending
monks to Mars first,

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.960 align:middle line:84%
so we can terraform it with
a frequency or vibration that

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.205 align:middle line:90%
will help to manifest life?

00:57:56.205 --> 00:57:57.080 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get a reply.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.430 align:middle line:84%
When it happened, is a rich
man said, Jesus, hey, man,

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.010 align:middle line:84%
what's required
for eternal life?

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:07.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm really into eternal life.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus said follow
the commandments.

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:15.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the secret
of eternal life.

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:17.220 align:middle line:90%
And what are the commandments?

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Commandments are love with all
your heart, with all your soul,

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:21.630 align:middle line:90%
and with all your mind.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the first and
greatest commandment.

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And the second is unto it--
love your neighbor as yourself.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:31.020 align:middle line:84%
All the law of the prophets
hang on these two commandments.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And the rich man said, well,
I've already done that.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:36.960 align:middle line:90%
What else is required?

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I got-- I don't know--

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.170 align:middle line:90%
$4 in my pocket.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:41.670 align:middle line:90%
How about that?

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:46.290 align:middle line:84%
No, there's only one way to get
through the eye of the needle--

00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:48.850 align:middle line:84%
love with all your
heart, mind, and soul.

00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And that enables you to manifest
your rainbow light body.

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:54.210 align:middle line:90%
And Jesus said so.

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Because the guy had said,
I've already done that.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.180 align:middle line:90%
What else is there?

00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And then Jesus told him.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.000 align:middle line:90%
And here's the punchline.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:84%
If that will be perfect, meaning
whole, holy, complete 360,

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:07.237 align:middle line:84%
"I am-plus," go and
sell what you got.

00:59:07.237 --> 00:59:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Give it to the poor.

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:09.528 align:middle line:84%
And you'll have
treasure in heaven.

00:59:09.528 --> 00:59:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Then you can come and follow me.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Because your stuff
isn't coming with you.

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not here advocating
go sell all your stuff

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:19.580 align:middle line:84%
and go stare at a painting
for the rest of your life.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But come to think of it,
it might not be a bad idea.

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Because we are talking about
eternal life here, right?

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And that is our ultimate goal
is to return to that source.

00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a
beautiful dovetailing

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.550 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian and
the Tibetan tradition.

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And we see exactly the same
imagery being employed.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to start to get
a little more into the science

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.370 align:middle line:90%
of ascension here.

00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.920 align:middle line:10%
As an enlightened
being, the Tibetans

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:49.040 align:middle line:10%
teach that Padmasambhava
has the ability

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.730 align:middle line:10%
to transmit the vibration
of enlightenment

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:55.850 align:middle line:10%
to seekers via his
physical image, which

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:59.150 align:middle line:10%
is equal to pure spirit energy.

00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:02.060 align:middle line:84%
He is an avatar,
a quantum being.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
he has the ability

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:08.130 align:middle line:84%
to transmit his vibration
of the rainbow light body

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:08.930 align:middle line:90%
through his image.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.780 align:middle line:84%
He's a busy guy
like Jesus, right?

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.360 align:middle line:84%
He can't come down and
teach it or instruct

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.910 align:middle line:84%
all seven and a
half billion of us,

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.640 align:middle line:90%
so he says, here's my picture.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Just use my picture.

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's basically what
they're saying.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Just use the image.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:27.930 align:middle line:84%
The image, as the gnostic
said, will show you the way.

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:29.820 align:middle line:90%
The image will show you the way.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Enter through the
image, the gnostic said.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't need a book.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:36.060 align:middle line:90%
Forget about the text.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The image will show you the
way, because we're avatars.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.800 align:middle line:90%
We're superbeings.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.320 align:middle line:84%
We can transmit our
vibration through an image.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
What this means
is that the images

01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:50.040 align:middle line:84%
of the guru in his rainbow
body transmits the vibration

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.450 align:middle line:90%
of this perfect state.

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you are
contemplating his image,

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:58.130 align:middle line:90%
he is contemplating you.

01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:00.680 align:middle line:84%
When you are
looking in his eyes,

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.740 align:middle line:84%
he is looking in your
eyes simultaneously.

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
This idea came
from Christianity.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
It came from Christianity,
just like Mary

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.310 align:middle line:84%
was taken along the Silk
Road and became Quan Yin.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
This idea, this principle
came from the earliest

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Christian teachings.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
In early Christianity,
an icon is a sacred image

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that is believed to be
charged with spiritual power.

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It can also transmit
spiritual power.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a living image
that functions

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.250 align:middle line:90%
as a portal or gateway.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:33.650 align:middle line:90%
This is not me speaking.

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:36.600 align:middle line:84%
You can go get any
book on sacred icons.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell you
exactly the same thing.

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:41.750 align:middle line:84%
This is what the first
Christians believed.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a two-way mirror and
a method of communication

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.160 align:middle line:90%
with the divine realms.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you are looking
at an image of Jesus

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:54.260 align:middle line:84%
transfiguring or metamorphosing,
phasing into his light body,

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
his presence is being
transmitted to you

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.290 align:middle line:90%
through that image.

01:02:00.290 --> 01:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you contemplate,
meditate, and reflect on that,

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
your body is beginning
to mirror what he

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.860 align:middle line:90%
is experiencing in that moment.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
I will give you the
neuroscience that

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:15.733 align:middle line:10%
tells us that is absolutely
true in just a moment.

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.150 align:middle line:10%
In the early
Christian traditions,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.320 align:middle line:10%
icons were specially created
to enable a visceral encounter

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.920 align:middle line:10%
with a holy being or to make
present a spiritual energy.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
They're a form of
visual alchemy that

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.210 align:middle line:84%
can assist in our
transformation,

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
especially icons
of transfiguration

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.570 align:middle line:90%
or metamorphosis.

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
They are considered to be
sacred mirrors to other realms.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, how come?

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, we
have all these churches,

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and Bibles being
published, and all that.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reason is because
you had a battle going on.

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The iconodules believed
in the power of the image.

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And the iconoclasts
said, no, no, no.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's the word that is
supreme in the text.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.270 align:middle line:90%
And we control those words.

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, we're going to
destroy all of those images

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate this
teaching, because you're

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.132 align:middle line:90%
in competition with us.

01:03:11.132 --> 01:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we went
through this period.

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
They call it iconoclasm
where they went and destroyed

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.530 align:middle line:90%
all of these images.

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.250 align:middle line:90%
What a loss for humanity.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.860 align:middle line:90%
What a setback.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And this went on until
about the 14th century.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
these images started

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.690 align:middle line:84%
to emerge in Crete,
in Russia, and mostly

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.220 align:middle line:90%
in the Eastern Church.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.340 align:middle line:84%
They still venerate
images where the artist

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
was a conduit, a
channel who would

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.450 align:middle line:84%
go into deep states
of meditation,

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
very often having a
vision in this state.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And they would
create these images

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
that were to be approached
as a two-way mirror.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Not as a static image,
but as a two-way mirror.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
You are looking at
Christ transfiguring.

01:03:57.110 --> 01:04:00.560 align:middle line:84%
He is sending the frequency
of the transfiguration to you

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
through the eyes.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the eye, again,
is the window to the soul.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
this is how

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
they would begin to manifest
their robe of light, the robe

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.410 align:middle line:84%
of sanctity, robe of glory, the
shining garment, the garment

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:15.710 align:middle line:84%
of light, the beaming garment,
all interchangeable terms

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
for the light body and bring
up from within themselves

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:24.635 align:middle line:84%
this powerful sense of liberty,
of cosmic freedom, of strength.

01:04:24.635 --> 01:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So through meditation,
we can connect

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
with these divine beings,
meditation on their image,

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and begin to embody
their frequencies.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's the most beautiful
teaching I can imagine.

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Leonardo knew this.

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:45.200 align:middle line:84%
This painting called
"Salvatore Mundi," the "Savior

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of the World," sold at
Christie's in December 2017

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.640 align:middle line:90%
for $453 million.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some people
think it's a fake,

01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and that Mohammed bin Salman,
the Saudi prince who bought it,

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.300 align:middle line:90%
got ripped off.

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
I think what Leonardo created
with this painting is an icon.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's worth a heck of a
lot more than $453 million.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
By the way, after it was
sold at Christie's, it

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to go to
the Louvre in Abu Dhabi,

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.160 align:middle line:90%
but it's never been seen since.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows where it is.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They think it's on Mohamed bin
Salman's yacht, the "Serenity."

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:30.690 align:middle line:84%
It's showing Christ
as both male--

01:05:30.690 --> 01:05:32.150 align:middle line:90%
masculine and feminine.

01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And what he holds is
the resurrection orb

01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:37.710 align:middle line:84%
in his hand with the triple
dot symbolizing that--

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:40.383 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans call
the Chintamani.

01:05:40.383 --> 01:05:41.550 align:middle line:90%
What does the Chintamani do?

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It manifests the
rainbow light body.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
So here's Christ
holding the Chintamani,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
but he's not holding it.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.012 align:middle line:90%
He's offering it to you.

01:05:51.012 --> 01:05:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the sign there?

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a blessing sign.

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.692 align:middle line:84%
It's like a John the
Baptist blessing sign.

01:05:56.692 --> 01:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the most
important paintings ever

01:05:58.900 --> 01:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%
created.

01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And it puts you in
the vortex of Christ

01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:05.890 align:middle line:84%
through Leonardo who
is offering to you

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate power of the
universe through this painting.

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:13.480 align:middle line:10%
So I had an
opportunity to see this

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.590 align:middle line:10%
just before it went on exhibit.

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:16.980 align:middle line:10%
And I told my wife, Claire.

01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.780 align:middle line:10%
I said, man, Leonardo's
last painting,

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.270 align:middle line:10%
his lost painting is going
to be on display in London

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.290 align:middle line:10%
and at Christie's.

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
And we got to go see it.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.847 align:middle line:84%
And should we get up early or
spend the night on the street

01:06:27.847 --> 01:06:29.680 align:middle line:84%
there to make sure we
get in line to see it?

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.420 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, no, no, no.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.057 align:middle line:84%
So I'm anticipating
throngs of people.

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
The Tube is going to
be shut down in London.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:37.720 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is going to trying to
get in front of this painting.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.705 align:middle line:90%
We get there.

01:06:38.705 --> 01:06:40.440 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody there.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:41.710 align:middle line:90%
It's just us.

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:42.680 align:middle line:90%
It's just us.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And I got to go stand in
front of Leonardo's vortex

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.930 align:middle line:90%
five times--

01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:48.308 align:middle line:84%
went through the
line five times.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
They'd let you go in there
for three minutes each time.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, people
started coming in.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.880 align:middle line:84%
But just imagine
if this painting--

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:03.160 align:middle line:84%
if Leonardo had a vision
of Christ manifest

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and then he's able to create a
painting, look at those eyes.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.680 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen anything
like those eyes?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.670 align:middle line:90%
They're leonine.

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:12.280 align:middle line:90%
It's such a powerful painting.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And just imagine we're in a
room that's just candle lit.

01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And this haunting
image is just floating

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.830 align:middle line:84%
in the room in front of us,
offering to us the Chintamani.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I view this.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it would
have originally been viewed.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Just so profound.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, we
know for sure this

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
is Christ, because it's
the exact same face

01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:35.460 align:middle line:90%
on the Shroud of Turin.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And so please don't tell
me Jesus never existed.

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't give me that crap.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.040 align:middle line:90%
That is such a bogus argument.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Of course, he did.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the Shroud
of Turin is an icon.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an icon, as the Catholic
Church has now affirmed,

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
of Christ and his
resurrection body.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.990 align:middle line:90%
The face is identical.

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
It's identical.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And Leonardo never saw
the Shroud of Turin.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.570 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:07.190 align:middle line:10%
How is it possible for an
image to transmit the presence

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:08.612 align:middle line:10%
or vibration of a deity?

01:08:08.612 --> 01:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into the neuroscience
of this a little bit.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very interesting.

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Around 200,000 years ago,
some mysterious event

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.660 align:middle line:84%
occurred that spontaneously
led to the modern human brain

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.270 align:middle line:90%
coming into existence in Africa.

01:08:23.270 --> 01:08:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
Michelangelo is trying

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to capture in this painting
in the Sistine Chapel

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.979 align:middle line:90%
of the creation of man.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Here's God transmitting
something to Adam

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.580 align:middle line:90%
who's over here on the left.

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:36.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, something you
need to know here

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:41.510 align:middle line:10%
is that Adam is portrayed as a
young man in the perfect body

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:42.770 align:middle line:10%
of a Greek athlete.

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:46.880 align:middle line:10%
This is how the Greeks visualize
the perfect light body.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.130 align:middle line:10%
This isn't actually
some Greek stud

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.590 align:middle line:10%
we're looking at
with a six pack.

01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
This is how the perfect
proportions of this body

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:58.430 align:middle line:84%
are reflective of the perfect
proportions of the light body.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:01.399 align:middle line:84%
And so because
Adam in this moment

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:04.069 align:middle line:84%
is not in his flesh
and blood body.

01:09:04.069 --> 01:09:08.300 align:middle line:84%
He is in the moment
before the so-called fall

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in the Book of Genesis
when all of humanity

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.490 align:middle line:90%
was in a light body form.

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:15.380 align:middle line:10%
And so he is in his
light body being

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.649 align:middle line:10%
prepared to receive an
infusion of something that

01:09:18.649 --> 01:09:20.660 align:middle line:10%
would transform him.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.359 align:middle line:10%
As the book of Zohar says,
the Jewish mystical book,

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.050 align:middle line:10%
when Adam dwelt in
the Garden of Eden,

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:27.680 align:middle line:10%
he was clothed in the
celestial garment, which is

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:29.720 align:middle line:10%
the garment of heavenly light.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.370 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly what
the Buddhas teach.

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:35.609 align:middle line:10%
This is our true
nature as light beings.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:38.359 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Church of St.
Francis of Assisi in Assisi,

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:42.380 align:middle line:10%
Italy, we see
Christ, God creating

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Adam as a being of
light in a mandorla,

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.439 align:middle line:10%
a perfect gateway of light.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:50.870 align:middle line:10%
Beyond our material
and emotional body,

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.770 align:middle line:10%
we have a body of light,
says Christian mysticism.

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Deep, deep inside of us, there
is a pure being, a pure light,

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:02.300 align:middle line:84%
pure energy existing
and total potentiality

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and then came the fall.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:07.610 align:middle line:10%
And what this means is that
humans, when we lived in Eden,

01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:09.290 align:middle line:10%
were in a different form.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.080 align:middle line:10%
We had perfect bodies of light.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.240 align:middle line:10%
And all of human
history is a quest

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:20.090 align:middle line:10%
to get back to our original
status as pure light beings.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.040 align:middle line:10%
The Kabbalistic theory
of humanity's origins

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.440 align:middle line:10%
as light beings is
echoed in Paul's comments

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.890 align:middle line:10%
in Corinthians when he said,
God created a heavenly atom

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:31.490 align:middle line:10%
in the spiritual world and
an earthly atom of clay

01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:33.417 align:middle line:10%
for the material world.

01:10:33.417 --> 01:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Buddhist
image of the guy

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.470 align:middle line:84%
in his earthly body connected
through the rainbow bridge

01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:38.330 align:middle line:90%
to his rainbow body?

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Exact same teaching.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:42.080 align:middle line:90%
Exact same teaching.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.460 align:middle line:84%
We have our earthly self, and
we have our celestial self.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying to
get back to that state

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.040 align:middle line:84%
where they're unified and we are
in our perfect bodies of light.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.710 align:middle line:10%
The Gospel of Philip
is a gnostic gospel

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.510 align:middle line:10%
that informs us about
this, telling us

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:58.400 align:middle line:10%
the Lord rose from the dead.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.080 align:middle line:10%
He became as he was.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.350 align:middle line:10%
But now, his body was perfect.

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.940 align:middle line:10%
And how many times
have we dropped

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:07.490 align:middle line:10%
the word perfect in
our conversation today?

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Multiple times.

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it is the
key word that we

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.680 align:middle line:84%
can use to weave ourselves
through these rainbow

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.270 align:middle line:90%
light body traditions.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.720 align:middle line:10%
He possessed flesh, but
this was true flesh.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:20.000 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh isn't true.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh is only an
image of the true.

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so we're made
in the image of God.

01:11:27.890 --> 01:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
God is not some dirty, old
white man on the throne.

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
That's not the image
we're talking about.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We are made in the image of God
in terms of our rainbow light

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.870 align:middle line:90%
body.

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:41.960 align:middle line:10%
When we get that, it
opens up a whole new way

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.710 align:middle line:10%
of looking at this.

01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So the question
then is, how do we

01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
get back to our original
rainbow light body?

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:50.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, we follow this path.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So God created mankind
in his own image.

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.390 align:middle line:10%
In the image of God, he
created them-- male and female.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.790 align:middle line:10%
He created them.

01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:01.660 align:middle line:90%
God is a artist.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%
We're an artistic creation.

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
We're works of art.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We're images made in the
image of our creator.

01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:15.810 align:middle line:84%
We are icons of
artistic parents, right?

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the light spirit, then,
that they transmitted to us?

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
When God is reaching out to
Adam to zap something to him,

01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.800 align:middle line:84%
what is that, that
he was transmitting?

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer is
it's the Holy Spirit.

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.450 align:middle line:10%
We'll come to that
in just a moment.

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:33.818 align:middle line:10%
This image is from the
13th century in France.

01:12:33.818 --> 01:12:35.610 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to go
back just for a moment.

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:36.960 align:middle line:10%
You see God there?

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.570 align:middle line:10%
He's got a compass in his hand.

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:42.600 align:middle line:10%
This is the first time
humanity is starting to think

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.900 align:middle line:10%
technology is a gift from God.

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:49.020 align:middle line:10%
So they actually started to
portray God with technology

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:50.040 align:middle line:10%
in his hands.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.555 align:middle line:10%
Tools, right?

01:12:51.555 --> 01:12:53.610 align:middle line:10%
In this case, a compass.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:57.930 align:middle line:10%
And God is using that
compass to manipulate

01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:01.950 align:middle line:10%
the image of humanity,
which is readily

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:05.580 align:middle line:10%
identifiable as a fractal.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.350 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's a Mandelbrot set.

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So here's the image
from the 13th century.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.800 align:middle line:90%
There's the Mandelbrot set.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.600 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same image.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the exact
same thing, right?

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.310 align:middle line:84%
The Mandelbrot set
was discovered in 1980

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
by Benoit Mandelbrot who was
working at IBM at the time.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
It's an infinitely
complex geometrical shape

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.650 align:middle line:84%
called the Mandelbrot set that
uses a very simple equation

01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.390 align:middle line:90%
with computers and graphics.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.570 align:middle line:84%
It was only possible to create
that image with the invention

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:35.820 align:middle line:90%
of computers.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Without computers, we're not
getting the Mandelbrot set.

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Mandelbrot
set is generated

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
by what is called iteration,
which means to repeat

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.790 align:middle line:90%
a process over and over again.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:47.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a set of numbers.

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And from these numbers,
you can generate pictures.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:52.320 align:middle line:10%
And the pictures are
infinitely complicated.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.140 align:middle line:10%
At every level of
magnification, the pattern

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.110 align:middle line:10%
repeats itself into infinity.

01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:00.690 align:middle line:10%
They call it a mathematical
icon that they refer

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.940 align:middle line:10%
to as the thumbprint of God.

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.380 align:middle line:10%
So here's an image of
the Mandelbrot set.

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.040 align:middle line:10%
And no matter how many
times or how deeply you

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.280 align:middle line:10%
magnify that image
at every level,

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:15.190 align:middle line:10%
it stays exactly the same.

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:16.990 align:middle line:84%
We're made in the
image of God, so we

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:20.620 align:middle line:84%
are fractals of
God, which means we

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
contain all of God's
essence within us

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:26.030 align:middle line:90%
and capabilities as fractals.

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.830 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.200 align:middle line:84%
If a programmer looks
at the Mandelbrot set

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and wants to change
some tiny detail,

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.780 align:middle line:84%
make another curlicue
or a bump go away,

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.640 align:middle line:84%
they can't do it
without going back

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.930 align:middle line:84%
to the original creation
or original equation

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:42.470 align:middle line:90%
and starting all over again.

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:45.100 align:middle line:10%
So in effect, they tear
down the universe in order

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.560 align:middle line:10%
to augment or build a new one.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.800 align:middle line:10%
Within this Mandelbrot set, we
see the richness of our unity

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.110 align:middle line:10%
and also the richness
of our individuality.

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
We are baby Mandelbrot
sets or fractals.

01:14:57.010 --> 01:14:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, some clever
mathematician back in the '80s

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
said, wow, Ben.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Wow, that is really awesome.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I see in the Mandelbrot
set is a meditating Buddha.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.260 align:middle line:10%
So here's the Akasagarbha
Buddha holding the triple dots

01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:13.330 align:middle line:10%
of the Chintamani, the
wish-fulfilling gem

01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:14.950 align:middle line:10%
at the level of
the heart that can

01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:16.840 align:middle line:10%
transmute the body into light.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.670 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm going to
do is take that image

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:23.160 align:middle line:10%
and superimpose on it
the Mandelbrot set.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:24.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect match.

01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't even have
Photoshop, so I didn't

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
manipulate this in any way.

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.370 align:middle line:90%
I just went, doink.

01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Perfect match.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So what the mathematicians
decided to do--

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.670 align:middle line:90%
let's change the equation.

01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And they came up with what they
call the Buddhabrot, right?

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting at my desk,
looking at this going,

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:45.690 align:middle line:90%
a rainbow-colored Buddhabrot.

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
What do you suppose is
going through my mind?

01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect match for
Padmasambhava in the rainbow

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.070 align:middle line:90%
body.

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:57.910 align:middle line:90%
There's more confirmation.

01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body
is our true nature.

01:15:59.890 --> 01:16:01.840 align:middle line:90%
We are made in the image of God.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not some dirty, old
white man on a throne

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
that everybody hates and
doesn't want me to talk

01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:08.830 align:middle line:90%
about religion anywhere.

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the light body, is the
image we're talking about.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.840 align:middle line:10%
It's the light body that
we're made in the image of.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.210 align:middle line:10%
Christianity teaches this.

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:22.690 align:middle line:10%
Because humans are made in
the perfect image of God,

01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:27.790 align:middle line:10%
we have the spiritual capacity
to participate in or mirror

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:30.430 align:middle line:10%
Jesus's divine glory
as image bearers

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.370 align:middle line:10%
and reactivate our light bodies.

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:36.580 align:middle line:10%
The Bible is very
direct and specific.

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:40.480 align:middle line:10%
As was the man of
dust or DNA, clay,

01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.590 align:middle line:10%
so also are those of dust
as is the man of heaven,

01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:47.020 align:middle line:10%
so also are those
who are of heaven.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:51.040 align:middle line:10%
Just as we have born the
image of the man of dust,

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.820 align:middle line:10%
our earthly flesh and
blood bodies, so also shall

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.610 align:middle line:10%
we bear the image of
the man of heaven.

01:16:58.610 --> 01:17:01.420 align:middle line:10%
It's already within us.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:05.590 align:middle line:10%
The image of the man of heaven
is Jesus in his rainbow light

01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:06.670 align:middle line:10%
body.

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:09.190 align:middle line:10%
And we have the
spiritual capacity

01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:12.870 align:middle line:10%
already within us in order
to manifest that body.

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it
on the Earth plane.

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And one way we can
begin to do that is

01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to put our hands up
and receive these codes

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and frequencies from
Jesus who is offering them

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.720 align:middle line:84%
to us at this very
moment, right?

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're connecting
ourselves--

01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:32.380 align:middle line:84%
our flesh and blood body
to the man of spirit.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It was Jan van Eyck who
invented oil painting that

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.630 align:middle line:84%
intended for his works
to be seen as if you

01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:43.386 align:middle line:90%
were present in this scene.

01:17:43.386 --> 01:17:46.160 align:middle line:90%
He's absolute genius alchemist.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.620 align:middle line:90%


01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Christianity is
founded on the premise

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:53.220 align:middle line:90%
that Christ is God incarnate.

01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
Paul said, Christ
and whom are hidden

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
all the treasures of
wisdom and knowledge

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is the image of
the invisible God.

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Just for fun, go back and look
at how many times the Bible

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.520 align:middle line:90%
talks about the image.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.680 align:middle line:90%
The image, the image, the image.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the art and science
of living ascension.

01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:12.720 align:middle line:90%
We are images of God.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.010 align:middle line:90%
We can embody it.

01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The question is, if
Christ is an image of God,

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.210 align:middle line:84%
he must then reflect
God or something of God.

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Can Christ as an image
be imaged himself?

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.100 align:middle line:90%
This is a big debate.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.260 align:middle line:84%
This is why they
destroyed all the icons.

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Can Christ as an image
of God be painted?

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Can we sculpt an
image of Christ?

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Or is this like asking if a beam
of sunlight reflected on water

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
can somehow leap from the
water and take on life?

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, the answer is yes.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.500 align:middle line:10%
Christ can be imaged.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.220 align:middle line:10%
And his image then can
transmit to us these higher

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.440 align:middle line:10%
spiritual frequencies.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.080 align:middle line:10%
So according to
these traditions,

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.780 align:middle line:10%
this work of art,
the human body,

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:57.080 align:middle line:10%
our body was lifeless until
the otherworldly artist

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.930 align:middle line:10%
breathed life or spirit into
the artificial creations.

01:18:59.930 --> 01:19:01.670 align:middle line:90%
And we became us.

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We are icons or images
of artistic parents.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So what is the life spirit
that they transmitted to us?

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:11.750 align:middle line:10%
That is a really
critical question

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:13.520 align:middle line:10%
here that we need to answer.

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.480 align:middle line:10%
And what was it that
that life spirit did?

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.828 align:middle line:10%
Well, the answer came from
a clever neurosurgeon who

01:19:20.828 --> 01:19:23.120 align:middle line:10%
was in the Vatican, looks up
at Michelangelo's painting

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.030 align:middle line:10%
and goes, this is impossible.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:28.040 align:middle line:10%
Because at the time, we
weren't doing autopsies

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.080 align:middle line:10%
on human cadavers.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.480 align:middle line:10%
So how did Michelangelo
know to put

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:39.740 align:middle line:10%
God in a cutaway of the human
brain, which is what he did?

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:43.040 align:middle line:90%
How did Michelangelo know that?

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.040 align:middle line:90%
So God is in the brain.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is where all the
action is going to take place

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.170 align:middle line:90%
as our story develops.

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.360 align:middle line:10%
What he's describing
here is the activation

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:57.560 align:middle line:10%
of our neocortex, which is what
happened 200,000 years ago.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.170 align:middle line:10%
Before that time, our new
layer of the brain is in place,

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.700 align:middle line:10%
but it's not activated.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.860 align:middle line:10%
It's like the hardware is
there, but the software

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.260 align:middle line:10%
isn't there to make it work.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.960 align:middle line:10%
The neocortex is what makes
possible our judgments

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.220 align:middle line:10%
and our knowledge
of good and evil.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.540 align:middle line:10%
It's also the site from which
our creativity emerges and also

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
is the home to
our sense of self.

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is very important.

01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:21.720 align:middle line:10%
Because if your neocortex
isn't activated,

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.170 align:middle line:10%
you have no sense of
self, no sense of "I."

01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:28.470 align:middle line:84%
This is when the
illusion began, right?

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.060 align:middle line:90%
This is when the illusion began.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And it began in Judeo-Christian
and Islamic civilization

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
when Eve reached up and took
that apple of wisdom and said,

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.700 align:middle line:90%
oh, wait a minute.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm naked.

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:41.520 align:middle line:90%
This is good.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.750 align:middle line:90%
That's evil.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.920 align:middle line:90%
That's light.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That's dark.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
If your neocortex
isn't activated,

01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:49.510 align:middle line:90%
you have no sense of judgment.

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
You can't make
those distinctions.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So when our neocortex is
activated, now all of a sudden,

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:57.700 align:middle line:90%
we're in this realm of illusion.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And our entire
civilization now is

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
the product of the
activation of our neocortex.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the distinction
of our species,

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the seed of our humanity,
says Carl Sagan.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knows how it
was activated or by whom.

01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:15.280 align:middle line:10%
Nobody-- no neuroscientists
can answer that.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.380 align:middle line:10%
We do know that it was charged
or awakened 75,000 years ago.

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.800 align:middle line:10%
It laid dormant for
about 125,000 years.

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.403 align:middle line:10%
This is according to John
Hoffecker, an archaeologist

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:27.820 align:middle line:10%
in the University
of Colorado, who

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:32.470 align:middle line:10%
says the neocortex was
switched on 75,000 years ago.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:36.130 align:middle line:10%
In a TED Talk given in 2010,
neuroscientist VS Ramachandran

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:40.510 align:middle line:10%
at UCLA had observed that
about 75,000 years ago-- doing

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:43.330 align:middle line:10%
his independent research--
there was a sudden emergence

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.670 align:middle line:10%
and rapid spread of skills
unique to human beings

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:48.580 align:middle line:10%
like the use of tools,
use of fire, shelters,

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.440 align:middle line:10%
and use of language,
plus the ability

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:53.980 align:middle line:10%
to read another person's mind
and interpret their behavior

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:54.820 align:middle line:10%
intentions.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:57.340 align:middle line:10%
All of it happened
at once, but they

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:59.560 align:middle line:10%
can't explain how it happened.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.800 align:middle line:10%
Whatever happened at that
moment spurred a modern capacity

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.380 align:middle line:10%
for judgment, for the capacity
for novelty invention,

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.750 align:middle line:10%
and most importantly,
for our conversation,

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:15.240 align:middle line:10%
the production and
appreciation of art.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.210 align:middle line:84%
That is why the
neocortex was activated.

01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:21.070 align:middle line:90%


01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The sudden and
miraculous transition

01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
from Homo erectus
to Homo sapiens

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
defies the conventional
theory of evolution.

01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we went from
Homo erectus to Homo luminous

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.140 align:middle line:90%
with nothing in between.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Something happened
to us, but what?

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Stephen J. Gould
said it's the theory

01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of punctuated
equilibrium where we

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.510 align:middle line:84%
go through these times of a long
period where nothing happens.

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
Then suddenly, there's a
massive spurt of evolution.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.950 align:middle line:10%
Some scientists say that, oh,
the activation of the neocortex

01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:58.420 align:middle line:10%
came from an asteroid or comet
impact or some relationship

01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:02.110 align:middle line:10%
between our sun and solar system
and the center of the Milky Way

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:03.470 align:middle line:10%
galaxy.

01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:07.390 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, you're out here
on the Orion arm of the galaxy.

01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:10.140 align:middle line:10%
And make the most of
this precious opportunity

01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:12.310 align:middle line:10%
while you're embodied.

01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So what occurred to
activate the neocortex?

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.800 align:middle line:84%
The hardware is there
for 200,000 years.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But then 40,000 years
ago, 75,000 years ago,

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.910 align:middle line:90%
something happened.

01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:26.440 align:middle line:84%
They throw up these
suppositions-- cooking meat,

01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic substances,
climate change, group sex.

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Scientists-- they all
are involved in what

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.990 align:middle line:90%
ultimately made us human.

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:36.970 align:middle line:10%
But whatever happened
is symbolized

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.480 align:middle line:10%
by that moment right there
in the Abrahamic religions--

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.460 align:middle line:10%
Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam.

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.980 align:middle line:10%
That moment when the serpent
comes out of the tree,

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:47.200 align:middle line:10%
gives Eve that
fruit, that is when

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.010 align:middle line:10%
our neocortex is activated.

01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:51.610 align:middle line:10%
That's what that moment
actually symbolizes.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:55.000 align:middle line:10%
So the tree in the neocortex
means the new bark.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.400 align:middle line:10%
The tree the serpent
is hiding within

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:01.420 align:middle line:10%
is within our consciousness,
within our brain.

01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:05.110 align:middle line:10%
So something activated these
capabilities, but what?

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:09.070 align:middle line:10%
Carl Sagan says it
was cosmic rays.

01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:10.630 align:middle line:10%
VS Ramachandran,
the neuroscientist,

01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:13.660 align:middle line:10%
claims it was the sudden
appearance of mirror neurons

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.110 align:middle line:10%
that allowed us to imitate and
emulate one another's actions.

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:19.570 align:middle line:10%
We have these wonderful
neurons in our neocortex

01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:20.980 align:middle line:10%
called mirror neurons that--

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:24.320 align:middle line:10%
they call them empathy
neurons, basically monkey see,

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.120 align:middle line:10%
monkey do.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when these
are activated,

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I can watch you
perform an action.

01:24:29.170 --> 01:24:30.820 align:middle line:90%
And I can duplicate it.

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to--

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
as Ramachandran
gives the example,

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:37.030 align:middle line:84%
a person doesn't have to--
can watch his father go

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
kill a polar bear,
skin the polar bear,

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:41.620 align:middle line:90%
and cook the polar bear.

01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:43.630 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have
to go relearn how

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
to do every step that took
his father or his predecessors

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.390 align:middle line:90%
to get the ability to do that.

01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:55.560 align:middle line:10%
He can watch and learn
instantly, just like that.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.060 align:middle line:10%
Something happened.

01:24:57.060 --> 01:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
What we now know
actually happened

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
was that two
chromosomes were fused.

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Chromosome 2 is responsible
for our capacity

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.920 align:middle line:84%
for empathy, for sympathy,
all of the activities

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.630 align:middle line:90%
of the neocortex.

01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know, at least
according to modern science,

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:14.880 align:middle line:90%
is that this happened.

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's very strange
that it happened.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.750 align:middle line:90%
We know exactly how it happened.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:23.010 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know
who actually did it.

01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:24.870 align:middle line:10%
We know that there was
an ancient telomere

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:28.830 align:middle line:10%
to telomere fusion
that is not natural.

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Some outside force was
responsible for fusing

01:25:32.730 --> 01:25:34.890 align:middle line:90%
these telomeres.

01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Who did this?

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.310 align:middle line:90%
And why?

01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't know exactly
who, but we do know how.

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:45.120 align:middle line:84%
We now have
CRISPR-Cas9 technology,

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.910 align:middle line:84%
which is what we could today use
to fuse genes and chromosomes.

01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:54.630 align:middle line:84%
So our brain was
tweaked long ago.

01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And we have to ask,
was it to make way

01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.740 align:middle line:90%
for the emerging digital brain?

01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:01.440 align:middle line:10%
That's another important
part of my conversation.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:04.740 align:middle line:10%
Due to one species,
us, Earth's biosphere

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.130 align:middle line:10%
has begun to resemble
a human brain.

01:26:08.130 --> 01:26:11.770 align:middle line:84%
AI is emerging as a
new layer of our brain.

01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So 200,000 years ago, the
neocortex is activated.

01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:19.290 align:middle line:10%
And here we are today, adding
a new layer to that new layer.

01:26:19.290 --> 01:26:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Is this why they
activated our neocortex?

01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:25.390 align:middle line:84%
You could make that
argument and leave it there.

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:28.840 align:middle line:10%
What is actually happening,
says Google's Ray Kurzweil,

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:34.090 align:middle line:10%
is that we are merging our
neocortex with the cloud.

01:26:34.090 --> 01:26:36.070 align:middle line:10%
We are augmenting our brain.

01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is the product of
the fusion of chromosome 2.

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:42.610 align:middle line:10%
So where did it come from?

01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:47.280 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Egyptian says it was
the god Ptah, came from Sirius,

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.100 align:middle line:10%
fashioned the human body.

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:52.210 align:middle line:10%
He even has a double
helix in his hieroglyph.

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:54.790 align:middle line:10%
Here is Ptah's business card.

01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:56.530 align:middle line:10%
He's the architect
of heaven and Earth,

01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:58.960 align:middle line:10%
the master craftsman of working
metal, sculptor, designer,

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and fashioner of
the bodies of men.

01:27:01.650 --> 01:27:05.530 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the double
helix in his hieroglyph.

01:27:05.530 --> 01:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Egyptologists say
that's a twisted rope.

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And they laugh when I say
it's a double helix of DNA.

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:12.758 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course,
the ancient Egyptians

01:27:12.758 --> 01:27:14.470 align:middle line:90%
knew nothing about DNA.

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:16.330 align:middle line:84%
But yet, here's
the god, they say

01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
fashioned the human
body, tweaked our body,

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.745 align:middle line:84%
probably is the one
who fused chromosome 2.

01:27:22.745 --> 01:27:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Low and below, he's got a
double helix in his hieroglyph.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.490 align:middle line:10%
Makes sense to me.

01:27:26.490 --> 01:27:28.240 align:middle line:10%
Ptah is an Egyptian
creator god who

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.780 align:middle line:10%
existed before all other
things and by his will,

01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.450 align:middle line:10%
thought the world
into existence.

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:37.540 align:middle line:10%
Ptah conceived of the world
by the thought of his heart,

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.880 align:middle line:10%
said the ancient Egyptians,
and gives life through

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.980 align:middle line:10%
the magic of his word.

01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Today, we call that
heart/brain coherence, OK?

01:27:47.330 --> 01:27:49.400 align:middle line:90%
So he fused chromosome 2.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So we can have
heart/brain coherence

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:53.990 align:middle line:90%
is a way of looking at this.

01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And here's a magnificent
statue of Ptah in his ascension

01:27:57.470 --> 01:28:01.700 align:middle line:84%
garment, his feathered ascension
garment with his resurrection

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:02.540 align:middle line:90%
stick.

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:06.650 align:middle line:84%
He is the original
resurrection god on Earth.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's my belief, based
on many years of research

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
looking into Ptah and the
Egyptian creation stories,

01:28:12.530 --> 01:28:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why he tweaked
our DNA and if he did, indeed,

01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
fuse chromosome 2,
was to assist us

01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:23.390 align:middle line:84%
in making our body a
more conducive vehicle

01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:25.880 align:middle line:90%
for the ascension of the soul.

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Because what we find in
the Egyptian tradition,

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.060 align:middle line:84%
as exemplified here from
the Temple of Nefertari

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.390 align:middle line:84%
in the Valley of the Queens, is
that she wears her transparent

01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.560 align:middle line:90%
linen garment.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:42.420 align:middle line:84%
She's got White Tara's red sash
on that enables her to fly.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:44.640 align:middle line:10%
And she's holding
out these hieroglyphs

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.810 align:middle line:10%
to Ptah who stands there before
his rainbow-colored stairway

01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:52.260 align:middle line:10%
to heaven, holding his
resurrection stick.

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.170 align:middle line:10%
He wears a white garment
that the Egyptians

01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:57.480 align:middle line:10%
called the [INAUDIBLE] garment.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:59.547 align:middle line:10%
And I like to joke that's
how we pronounce Christ

01:28:59.547 --> 01:29:00.630 align:middle line:10%
in Nashville where I live.

01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
People go to the
Church of Christ.

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.770 align:middle line:10%
And little do they
know they're using

01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:07.950 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Egyptian
term for the light body,

01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:10.350 align:middle line:10%
for the cloak of light.

01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So Nefertari is holding
out this hieroglyph

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that is the Egyptian
hieroglyph for new clothes.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
She is saying to Ptah, thank
you for helping me to manifest

01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
my eternal light body, so
that I can live forever

01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:27.750 align:middle line:90%
as a divine being of light.

01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:30.060 align:middle line:10%
It was Ptah who
originally brought

01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.820 align:middle line:10%
the original ancient
Egyptian teaching

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:37.650 align:middle line:10%
about opening a rusty
valve in our pineal gland

01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:39.990 align:middle line:10%
through the use of
tones, lights, and an as

01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:43.470 align:middle line:10%
yet unidentified plant
that would release pulses

01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:46.860 align:middle line:10%
of hormones, similar to
the ecdysone that transform

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.190 align:middle line:10%
a caterpillar into a butterfly
that would enable them

01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:54.480 align:middle line:10%
to mutate into a non-molecular
light body into which

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:57.540 align:middle line:10%
their consciousness could
be copied and pasted.

01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.000 align:middle line:10%
And then the gods
and pharaohs that

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.940 align:middle line:10%
transformed humans, including
Tutankhamun and others,

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:06.990 align:middle line:10%
could then live forever as
resurrected eternal beings

01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:08.940 align:middle line:10%
like Osiris.

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So you will see Osiris, the
Egyptian god of resurrection,

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.420 align:middle line:84%
on his feathered
ascension throne, i.e.,

01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
the Merkaba throne--

01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:19.800 align:middle line:90%
is feathered because it flies.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's his ascension throne,
his Merkaba throne.

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And in Egyptian art,
you will see pharaohs.

01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:28.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a Ptolemaic king,
a human just like you

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
and I, who has completed the
ascension process and now rides

01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.930 align:middle line:84%
upon what the ancient
Egyptians called

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the ark of the millions of
years, the ship of eternity

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:42.750 align:middle line:84%
on his feathered Merkaba throne,
holding his resurrection stick,

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:45.090 align:middle line:90%
his key of life with his crown.

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And we notice-- and this
is my great contribution,

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to
esoteric Egyptology, is

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
that the ark of the
millions of years

01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:58.740 align:middle line:84%
matches precisely the way modern
science portrays a wormhole.

01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:02.220 align:middle line:10%
And what I began to
speculate is that if Ptah is

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.080 align:middle line:10%
the guy that tweaked our DNA--

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:06.510 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptians said he's
also the god of technology who

01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:09.300 align:middle line:10%
created the resurrection stick,
and the ark of the million

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.220 align:middle line:10%
years, and all this
other technology.

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Did he tweak our DNA, so that
we could ride the ascension

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.370 align:middle line:90%
throne?

01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense to me.

01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
operating principle,

01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
that this is what all the
ancient Egyptian mysteries are

01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
actually all about, perfectly
demonstrated on the wall.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.170 align:middle line:10%
So this Ptolemaic king, Soter
III, has his crown of wisdom,

01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:32.940 align:middle line:10%
his key of life, his
resurrection stick,

01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:35.280 align:middle line:10%
his feathered ascension
throne, and his lotus craft.

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.974 align:middle line:10%
Have we ever seen those
symbols before anywhere?

01:31:37.974 --> 01:31:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:42.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Isn't that exactly the same
set of symbols that we saw with

01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:44.340 align:middle line:10%
Padmasambhava?

01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.290 align:middle line:10%
Yes, it is.

01:31:46.290 --> 01:31:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Because this teaching
is not Tibetan.

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.980 align:middle line:10%
It's not Christian.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:51.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not Egyptian.

01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:52.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not Islamic.

01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.090 align:middle line:90%
It's cosmic.

01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the original
cosmic teaching

01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that came from
other star systems

01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and is taught in our
solar system as well.

01:32:03.450 --> 01:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we see in the
resurrection body of Osiris.

01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:09.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a perfect match for
the rainbow light body.

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:12.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was Ptah who
originated this.

01:32:12.670 --> 01:32:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He put on the image of the gods.

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Back to the image again, back to
tweaking the neocortex, right?

01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:25.160 align:middle line:10%
In Sumerian mythohistory,
Ptah is called Enki.

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.650 align:middle line:10%
He is the god that
fashioned the human body

01:32:27.650 --> 01:32:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and put on it, according
to the Atrahasis,

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.600 align:middle line:10%
the image of the gods.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:33.560 align:middle line:10%
The image.

01:32:33.560 --> 01:32:35.600 align:middle line:10%
What is the image?

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.760 align:middle line:10%
It's obviously alien DNA.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.070 align:middle line:10%
It's extraterrestrial DNA.

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.270 align:middle line:10%
That is what the image is.

01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:44.420 align:middle line:10%
And the new being that they
created was called the Lulu.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:47.270 align:middle line:10%
The Lulu and a
goddess named Nanna.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.530 align:middle line:10%
We still use that term today.

01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:53.630 align:middle line:10%
Nanna carried this first
human being called Adapa who

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.240 align:middle line:10%
was the first human to ascend.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.710 align:middle line:10%
And this is why
they created him,

01:32:57.710 --> 01:32:59.630 align:middle line:10%
because Adapa, as soon
as he was created,

01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:02.900 align:middle line:10%
took the path to heaven, right?

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
tweaked us is to enable

01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:07.430 align:middle line:90%
us to complete this ascension.

01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Why are you're going
to create a being

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and then take them
on the path to heaven

01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:12.770 align:middle line:90%
if this isn't a test pilot?

01:33:12.770 --> 01:33:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's just see if
this tweaking works,

01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:18.035 align:middle line:84%
this fusing of chromosome 2,
an activation in the neocortex.

01:33:18.035 --> 01:33:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's make sure this works.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take this
guy on the path to heaven.

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So Nanna would fix upon
the image of the gods

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.600 align:middle line:90%
and what will be is man.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:30.440 align:middle line:10%
In 2018, a Chinese
scientist caused the world

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:35.060 align:middle line:10%
to go completely ballistic
when he used CRISPR technology

01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.900 align:middle line:10%
on human embryos to create
genetically edited babies

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:42.440 align:middle line:10%
resistant to HIV that will
pass the modifications

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.690 align:middle line:10%
on to future generations.

01:33:44.690 --> 01:33:48.630 align:middle line:84%
He genetically
modified twin sisters.

01:33:48.630 --> 01:33:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what he named them?

01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Nanna and Lulu.

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:56.580 align:middle line:84%
He must have been reading
the Sumerian stories,

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.950 align:middle line:84%
otherwise this is one of
the greatest synchronicities

01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:00.600 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.140 align:middle line:10%
And today, are we transferring
these images to creations

01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.940 align:middle line:10%
made in our image--

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.040 align:middle line:10%
robots and artificial beings?

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:09.900 align:middle line:10%
Yes, we are.

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:13.540 align:middle line:10%
We're doing exactly
what Ptah did long ago.

01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So if Ptah tweaked our DNA
and fused chromosome 2,

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:19.590 align:middle line:90%
why did he do this?

01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Why did he do so?

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
To make the body a
more conducive vehicle

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:24.510 align:middle line:90%
for the ascension of the soul.

01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my gosh.

01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
There we said it.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that what really happened
when he fused chromosome 2?

01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Humans got what?

01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Souls.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.050 align:middle line:90%
We were given souls.

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Our ancestors got a
transphysical soul

01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:46.560 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
fusion of chromosome 2.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.550 align:middle line:84%
The real Adam and
Eve became ensouled.

01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:52.740 align:middle line:90%
This is what I feel happened.

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.590 align:middle line:90%
Is there a soul?

01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a soul?

01:34:56.110 --> 01:34:59.012 align:middle line:90%
How do you know you have a soul?

01:34:59.012 --> 01:35:00.095 align:middle line:90%
It's not a trick question.

01:35:00.095 --> 01:35:02.630 align:middle line:90%


01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:04.430 align:middle line:10%
How do you know you have a soul?

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Before chromosome 2 is
fused, we did not have souls.

01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:12.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why they did it was
to make the body a more

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.730 align:middle line:90%
conducive vehicle for the soul.

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
were actually ensouled.

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:22.130 align:middle line:10%
And here is why I say that
is because our soul and God's

01:35:22.130 --> 01:35:26.900 align:middle line:10%
presence and connection to it
allows for 12 capacities that

01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:32.270 align:middle line:10%
are inaccessible to artificial
life forms like robots and even

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:34.340 align:middle line:10%
animals.

01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Only beings with souls
have these abilities.

01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.030 align:middle line:10%
Those capacities which only
come from the activation

01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:44.660 align:middle line:10%
of chromosome 2-- empathy,
remember, is the key.

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:46.440 align:middle line:10%
Souls have empathy.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.890 align:middle line:10%
We have self-consciousness,
conceptual ideas,

01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:52.200 align:middle line:10%
the quest for perfect truth.

01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Ensouled beings have
spiritually sacred numinous

01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
transcendent reality or
the recognition of it,

01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the desire for a perfect home,
the capacity for empathy.

01:36:01.290 --> 01:36:04.470 align:middle line:10%
Without the fusion of
chromosome 2, no empathy.

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:05.610 align:middle line:90%
No empathy.

01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I'm saying this
is the reason why it was done

01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and how it was done.

01:36:10.650 --> 01:36:15.330 align:middle line:10%
The desire for perfect love, the
capacity for moral reflection,

01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:18.600 align:middle line:10%
the desire for perfect
justice and goodness,

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.220 align:middle line:10%
the capacity to
appreciate and be

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.530 align:middle line:10%
filled by the beautiful
in nature, music, and art.

01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Unless our neocortex
is activated,

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:27.750 align:middle line:90%
we don't appreciate art.

01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:29.792 align:middle line:10%
I loved my cats, but
they didn't like--

01:36:29.792 --> 01:36:31.500 align:middle line:10%
yeah, they might have
liked my music when

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:32.550 align:middle line:10%
I would play guitar for them.

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:33.925 align:middle line:10%
They sit and listen
all the time.

01:36:33.925 --> 01:36:36.420 align:middle line:10%
Never said anything, but I
think they appreciate it.

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:39.510 align:middle line:10%
But they didn't go to say, hey,
William, take me to a museum.

01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.220 align:middle line:10%
I want to look at
images of other cats.

01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:43.242 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:36:43.242 --> 01:36:44.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
that consciousness.

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:45.500 align:middle line:90%
We do.

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we have our activated
neocortex through chromosome 2.

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So the desire for perfect
beauty, the capacity for free

01:36:52.770 --> 01:36:54.150 align:middle line:90%
will.

01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Was it the soul that
caused our latent abilities

01:36:57.390 --> 01:37:00.990 align:middle line:84%
in the quest for perfection
to suddenly switch on?

01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:03.840 align:middle line:84%
I believe that that is what
is being described here.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And more directly, did the
soul switch on the neocortex?

01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I can't answer
that definitively,

01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:12.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
important question here

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.708 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be drawn in.

01:37:13.708 --> 01:37:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I know Gregg Braden
talks about this.

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:17.542 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't go into this level
that we're talking about.

01:37:17.542 --> 01:37:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I know Bruce Fenton
talks about it

01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
with the extraterrestrial
hybrid dynamic--

01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:22.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't touch this.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is a different
facet of this conversation.

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
taking us into a more--

01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:34.890 align:middle line:84%
certainly a more personal level
and certainly the soul level.

01:37:34.890 --> 01:37:36.660 align:middle line:10%
With the activation
of the neocortex,

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:39.450 align:middle line:10%
we get the activation
of mirror neurons

01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:42.780 align:middle line:10%
Ramachandran and researchers at
UCLA found that mirror neuron

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.270 align:middle line:10%
cells in the human
anterior cingulate,

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:48.073 align:middle line:10%
which normally fire when
you poke the patient with

01:37:48.073 --> 01:37:49.740 align:middle line:10%
a needle-- they're
called pain neurons--

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:53.860 align:middle line:10%
will also fire when you're
watching a patient being poked,

01:37:53.860 --> 01:37:54.660 align:middle line:10%
right?

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.937 align:middle line:90%
Hence, mirror neurons.

01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:58.020 align:middle line:84%
The brain can't tell the
difference between a real

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and an imagined
experience, right?

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:01.720 align:middle line:90%
>> We know that.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.762 align:middle line:84%
Everything is brought to
life in our imagination.

01:38:03.762 --> 01:38:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The brain can't tell if
I'm watching it being poked

01:38:06.450 --> 01:38:07.920 align:middle line:90%
or if I'm actually being poked.

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:13.780 align:middle line:84%
But what it does have is an
editor that says chill out.

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:15.682 align:middle line:84%
You're not actually
being poked with a needle

01:38:15.682 --> 01:38:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or punched into
the face like Rocky

01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:18.730 align:middle line:90%
as you're watching the movie.

01:38:18.730 --> 01:38:21.310 align:middle line:10%
You are feeling it
with him, but there's

01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:25.458 align:middle line:10%
an editor that says
don't go full blown pain

01:38:25.458 --> 01:38:27.250 align:middle line:10%
or don't go full blown,
feeling like you're

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:28.333 align:middle line:10%
being punched in the face.

01:38:28.333 --> 01:38:30.760 align:middle line:10%
Please don't go stigmata
as you're watching Rocky.

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:33.370 align:middle line:10%
In other words, don't have your
face all blown up, and bloody,

01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:35.080 align:middle line:10%
and all that kind
of thing, right?

01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:36.385 align:middle line:90%
It could.

01:38:36.385 --> 01:38:37.870 align:middle line:90%
It could.

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:40.090 align:middle line:84%
The mirror neurons
dissolve the barrier

01:38:40.090 --> 01:38:42.340 align:middle line:84%
between self and others,
is what Ramachandran says.

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, here is the kicker.

01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:45.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole
new piece to this

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:47.670 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
getting anywhere else.

01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
that out of ego.

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:52.540 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know this
is a very important part

01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of our art and science of
living ascension program here.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Writing in "The evolution of
the brain, the human nature

01:39:00.370 --> 01:39:02.980 align:middle line:84%
of cortical circuits, and
intellectual creativity,"

01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
published on the "Frontiers
of Neuroanatomy" journal,

01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:09.970 align:middle line:84%
researcher Javier DeFelipe
proposes the newly acquired

01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:13.390 align:middle line:84%
cognitive capacity, the
activation of the neocortex

01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:14.800 align:middle line:90%
through chromosome 2.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And genus Homo sapien
has one purpose--

01:39:19.210 --> 01:39:23.365 align:middle line:84%
for the production and
appreciation of art,

01:39:23.365 --> 01:39:26.760 align:middle line:90%
a uniquely human attribute.

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:27.760 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.590 align:middle line:84%
This is why they did it, for
the production and appreciation,

01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:37.240 align:middle line:84%
which means our ability to
merge or sync with what we're

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.270 align:middle line:90%
seeing in an image.

01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:43.630 align:middle line:10%
Says DeFelipe, "The hominid
brain grew an accelerating pace

01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:46.510 align:middle line:10%
until it reached its present
size about 200,000 years ago,

01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:48.850 align:middle line:10%
yet uniquely human abilities
such as the invention

01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:51.550 align:middle line:10%
of highly sophisticated,
standardized, multi-part tools,

01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:55.780 align:middle line:10%
tailored clothes, art, religious
beliefs, and perhaps even

01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.960 align:middle line:10%
language are thought to have
emerged quite rapidly 40,000

01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:01.930 align:middle line:10%
years ago, a sudden explosion
of human mental abilities

01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:04.560 align:middle line:10%
and cultures that is sometimes
called the Big Bang."

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Right?

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.750 align:middle line:84%
"Recent research,"
he goes on to say,

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
"carried out on the motor
neural system in humans

01:40:10.690 --> 01:40:13.120 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
techniques has shown

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that even the observation
of static images of actions

01:40:18.220 --> 01:40:23.560 align:middle line:84%
leads to action simulation in
the brain of the observer."

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So as you are looking
at Eve reaching up

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.950 align:middle line:84%
to receive that piece of
fruit through your activated

01:40:29.950 --> 01:40:33.970 align:middle line:84%
neocortex, your
neurons are firing

01:40:33.970 --> 01:40:39.340 align:middle line:84%
as if you are reaching up
to receive that yourself.

01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Action simulation through the
activation of the same brain

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
regions normally
activated by execution

01:40:47.170 --> 01:40:48.897 align:middle line:90%
of the observed actions.

01:40:48.897 --> 01:40:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The brain can't tell the
difference between a real

01:40:50.980 --> 01:40:52.220 align:middle line:90%
and an imagined experience.

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you are looking at
a piece of art of someone

01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
reaching up and
grabbing an apple,

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.110 align:middle line:90%
your neurocortex is firing.

01:40:59.110 --> 01:41:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Your mirror neurons are firing
as if you are doing that.

01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is where I
wish I was writing a PhD

01:41:05.050 --> 01:41:05.890 align:middle line:90%
thesis at this time.

01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Because no such
thesis has been done.

01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:14.960 align:middle line:84%
But I will put this in a public
forum in this matter to say,

01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.540 align:middle line:84%
can we extrapolate
that to images

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:20.660 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the rainbow
light body and transfiguration?

01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Of course we can.

01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:23.730 align:middle line:10%
Where is the limit?

01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:25.760 align:middle line:90%
There is no limit.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I am saying
this is the most direct route

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:31.790 align:middle line:90%
to activating your light body.

01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:35.120 align:middle line:84%
This is why
chromosome 2 is fused.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.030 align:middle line:84%
This is why our
neocortex was activated,

01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:41.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we could look at an
image of Christ transfiguring

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.130 align:middle line:84%
or Padmasambhava
in his light body.

01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, your
mirror neurons

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:47.660 align:middle line:84%
are firing as if you
are transfiguring.

01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And your rainbow light
body is being activated.

01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But what you've got
is the monkey mind

01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:53.280 align:middle line:90%
that goes, chill out, William.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.940 align:middle line:84%
You got a flight to catch
in three hours, right?

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't go full rainbow light
body in front of everybody

01:41:58.190 --> 01:42:00.470 align:middle line:90%
just now, OK?

01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But if I could somehow
get rid of that editor,

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I could dissolve into rainbow
light right in front of you,

01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:09.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to let
Kanye West do that.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Because he's the messiah
and I'm not, all right?

01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Witnessing action activates
the same neural networks

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
as those used to
perform the activities.

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's read that together.

01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Witnessing action activates
the same neural networks

01:42:28.050 --> 01:42:30.720 align:middle line:84%
as those used to perform
these activities.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:34.320 align:middle line:84%
That is your key to your
ascension right there,

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.370 align:middle line:84%
not standing on your head
singing, hob skibbly hob hoben,

01:42:38.370 --> 01:42:40.020 align:middle line:90%
or drinking some potion.

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you might want an oil.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:44.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is your
most direct route

01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:47.030 align:middle line:90%
to activating your light body.

01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have known this
for thousands of years.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the gods that
tweaked our DNA and fused

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:56.850 align:middle line:90%
chromosome 2 said so.

01:42:56.850 --> 01:43:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Because this is why they
did it to begin with.

01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the materials of
the transfiguration icon

01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:06.570 align:middle line:90%
became a channel.

01:43:06.570 --> 01:43:09.330 align:middle line:90%
The link is your mirror neurons.

01:43:09.330 --> 01:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example of this,
of how-- of an ancient story

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:15.270 align:middle line:90%
reflecting exactly this concept.

01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we were talking
about Adam and Eve

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.960 align:middle line:84%
with the serpent in
the tree and saying

01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.720 align:middle line:90%
that's our brain and neocortex.

01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's Moses before
a serpent on a pole

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.660 align:middle line:90%
in a very important story.

01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Moses and the Israelites
have just escaped Egypt.

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:32.803 align:middle line:84%
They're wandering
around the wilderness.

01:43:32.803 --> 01:43:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Israelites are
getting a little upset.

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.990 align:middle line:84%
They're like, Moses, we're
just walking around here.

01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:38.040 align:middle line:90%
And nothing is going on.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:39.600 align:middle line:90%
We're getting hungry.

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And what's the point
of all of this?

01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
Israelites are being

01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:48.870 align:middle line:84%
attacked by flying serpents,
says the Book of Numbers.

01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:51.882 align:middle line:84%
Winged serpents
are attacking them.

01:43:51.882 --> 01:43:53.340 align:middle line:10%
There are actual
academics that say

01:43:53.340 --> 01:43:58.570 align:middle line:10%
those are flying dinosaurs
leftover that are attacking

01:43:58.570 --> 01:44:00.600 align:middle line:10%
the Israelites, right?

01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:05.220 align:middle line:10%
And they're being harmed
by these winged serpents.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:07.890 align:middle line:10%
So Moses prayed for the people.

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said to
Moses, make, craft,

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
devise a fiery serpent
and set it on a pole.

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And everyone who is bitten
when he sees it will live.

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:25.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a minute.

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:29.530 align:middle line:84%
When the Israelites looked at
this sculpted metal serpent

01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:33.910 align:middle line:84%
on a pole, a work of art,
which is called the Nehushtan,

01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:35.350 align:middle line:90%
they were healed.

01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:37.520 align:middle line:90%
It's a work of art.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a work of art.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It's a device that transmits
a healing vibration.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:47.050 align:middle line:10%
Jesus later told Nicodemus
that this work of art,

01:44:47.050 --> 01:44:50.420 align:middle line:10%
the serpent on a pole, is
the key to eternal life.

01:44:50.420 --> 01:44:52.610 align:middle line:10%
So this is very important
that we understand this.

01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:53.985 align:middle line:10%
And the question
that comes along

01:44:53.985 --> 01:44:58.930 align:middle line:10%
with it is, can God, with
a big G or a little g,

01:44:58.930 --> 01:45:01.540 align:middle line:10%
inhabit a statue, a
painting, or any work of art

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.970 align:middle line:10%
made by human hands?

01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Is this possible?

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Can God transmit a holy
vibration from this image,

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:14.560 align:middle line:84%
from the work of art to the
human image, to we icons?

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Can the presence of God be made
present in our material world?

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.380 align:middle line:84%
One must carefully
answer these questions.

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Because, in fact, they are at
the heart of all of the world's

01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:29.830 align:middle line:84%
religious traditions
and, in fact,

01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:34.300 align:middle line:90%
are the key to your ascension.

01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for the
soul and we icons--

01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:40.090 align:middle line:90%
we are works of art, as I said--

01:45:40.090 --> 01:45:44.230 align:middle line:84%
to use art as a conduit to
the divine realm, a higher

01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:48.250 align:middle line:84%
dimension, or to transmit a
divine vibration through art?

01:45:48.250 --> 01:45:51.520 align:middle line:10%
My answer is yes it is.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.280 align:middle line:10%
This is why they activated
chromosome 2 to activate

01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.820 align:middle line:10%
our neocortex, so we have
empathy neurons so that we

01:45:57.820 --> 01:45:59.470 align:middle line:10%
can go monkey see, monkey do.

01:45:59.470 --> 01:46:01.120 align:middle line:84%
How much more-- how
much easier do you

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.900 align:middle line:84%
want it to be for it to ascend,
than to look at an image

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
and allow the divine presence
to flow through that image

01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:14.330 align:middle line:84%
into your image and to
transmute your body into light?

01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And it is key to
remember, the heart

01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is our primary
center that organizes

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.060 align:middle line:84%
and relays the energy of love
from our highest dimensions.

01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
the mirror neurons.

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the heart
working in coherence

01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:31.850 align:middle line:84%
with the mirror
neurons that enables

01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:36.410 align:middle line:84%
us to activate the image by
reaching out through the heart

01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to the higher dimensions to
bring in these frequencies.

01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:41.750 align:middle line:90%
And what is the frequency?

01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:43.460 align:middle line:90%
It's love.

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:46.230 align:middle line:10%
It's love.

01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:49.580 align:middle line:10%
For where your treasure is,
there your heart will be also,

01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.380 align:middle line:10%
said Jesus.

01:46:50.380 --> 01:46:53.727 align:middle line:10%
The eye is the lamp of the body.

01:46:53.727 --> 01:46:55.560 align:middle line:10%
And if your vision is
clear, your whole body

01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:57.818 align:middle line:10%
will be full of light.

01:46:57.818 --> 01:46:59.610 align:middle line:10%
But if your vision is
poor, your whole body

01:46:59.610 --> 01:47:01.270 align:middle line:10%
will also be full of darkness.

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:04.032 align:middle line:10%
If then the light
is within you--

01:47:04.032 --> 01:47:05.490 align:middle line:10%
excuse me-- if the
light within you

01:47:05.490 --> 01:47:08.010 align:middle line:10%
is darkness, how great
is that darkness?

01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Right?

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.320 align:middle line:10%
When we open our heart,
we develop new pathways

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.840 align:middle line:10%
for the soul to synchronize
with the infinite love

01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:21.135 align:middle line:10%
and creativity of the
heart in the spirit realm.

01:47:21.135 --> 01:47:26.230 align:middle line:10%
And we can only do that with
the activated neocortex looking

01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:27.030 align:middle line:10%
at the image.

01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:29.520 align:middle line:10%
Jesus said that if you live
from the love in the heart

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.672 align:middle line:10%
and divine unity, you
will know the truth.

01:47:31.672 --> 01:47:32.880 align:middle line:10%
And truth will make you free.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.917 align:middle line:90%


01:47:35.917 --> 01:47:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Want to talk about the
Sacred Heart of Jesus here.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm not Catholic, but I
love some Catholic imagery.

01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:42.850 align:middle line:10%
It's so profound.

01:47:42.850 --> 01:47:44.230 align:middle line:10%
It's so mystical.

01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is one example here--
the Sacred Heart of Jesus

01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:47.380 align:middle line:90%
as it's called.

01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It's viewed as a symbol of God's
boundless and passionate love

01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:54.630 align:middle line:90%
for mankind in Catholicism.

01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember the moment
Claire and I first saw this

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.400 align:middle line:90%
in Santa Maggiore in Rome.

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at this, going,
man, he's floating, right?

01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:06.180 align:middle line:84%
He floating above this
fountain of water.

01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:08.730 align:middle line:84%
It's called a devotion
picture of the "Sacred Heart."

01:48:08.730 --> 01:48:10.770 align:middle line:90%
And it was first adored by--

01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:14.170 align:middle line:84%
what we see is Jesus being
adored by Saint Margaret Mary

01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:17.535 align:middle line:84%
Alacoque and the Blessed
Mary of the Divine Heart.

01:48:17.535 --> 01:48:20.430 align:middle line:90%
It's Sopra Minerva in Rome.

01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Look at Sister Mary here.

01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:25.800 align:middle line:10%
What is she doing?

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Beaming energy, too, or
receiving it from this image?

01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:31.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:36.170 align:middle line:84%
They're in deep ecstasy here,
deep states of bliss, trance,

01:48:36.170 --> 01:48:37.580 align:middle line:90%
as a matter of fact.

01:48:37.580 --> 01:48:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Sacred Heart
of Jesus is wide open,

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.130 align:middle line:84%
beaming light frequency and
love frequencies to them.

01:48:46.130 --> 01:48:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The popularization of this
devotion in its modern form

01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:52.080 align:middle line:84%
is derived from a
Catholic nun from France.

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:53.510 align:middle line:90%
She said she had apparition.

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:56.000 align:middle line:84%
She saw apparitions
of Jesus that appeared

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.240 align:middle line:90%
to her between 1673 and 1675.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:03.400 align:middle line:10%
An apparition is Catholic
speak for a light being.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:04.200 align:middle line:10%
A light being.

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.460 align:middle line:10%
An apparition means a
full-spectrum being,

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:08.480 align:middle line:10%
a light being.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:10.040 align:middle line:10%
And there are
numerous appearances

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.130 align:middle line:10%
of apparitions that are reported
throughout Christian history.

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.130 align:middle line:10%
Not only Jesus appearing
in his light body form,

01:49:16.130 --> 01:49:18.970 align:middle line:10%
but Mary appeared in one of
the most famous apparitions

01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:20.420 align:middle line:10%
at Lourdes.

01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.820 align:middle line:10%
My wife, Claire, and I
take people to Lourdes

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:24.650 align:middle line:10%
to experience the
healing waters there

01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:28.250 align:middle line:10%
that were opened up by Mary
and her light body form.

01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Our Virgin of Guadalupe is
Mary, an apparition of Mary that

01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:36.470 align:middle line:90%
happened in Mexico in 1571.

01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And she's portrayed in art
wearing her cloak of light,

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.450 align:middle line:90%
radiant, luminous, so forth.

01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:42.770 align:middle line:90%
She's in her star body.

01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:45.205 align:middle line:84%
She's in her rainbow light
body, as a matter of fact.

01:49:45.205 --> 01:49:46.580 align:middle line:84%
These are
interchangeable images.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Mary is the first
Christian to ascend.

01:49:48.710 --> 01:49:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you get the idea
that the apparitions of Mary

01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.990 align:middle line:84%
are the appearance of Mary
and her rainbow light body,

01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:56.960 align:middle line:84%
you're suddenly now in a whole
new level of understanding

01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.480 align:middle line:90%
of Christian mysticism.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.090 align:middle line:10%
Here's a comparison of
Padmasambhava and his rainbow

01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:04.620 align:middle line:10%
light body and Filippino
Lippi's painting of Mary

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:07.430 align:middle line:10%
in her many colored
garment, her cloak of light.

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Look at this crown
that he's created.

01:50:10.130 --> 01:50:12.380 align:middle line:84%
You see the star on her
shoulder that indicates

01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.910 align:middle line:90%
she's in her star body?

01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:16.380 align:middle line:90%
She's got on her plasma crown.

01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:18.725 align:middle line:84%
How'd you like to
have one of those?

01:50:18.725 --> 01:50:20.100 align:middle line:84%
It'd be pretty
cool, wouldn't it?

01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can.

01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:22.440 align:middle line:90%
You can.

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, as you're
looking at this image of Mary

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:27.722 align:middle line:84%
and her light body, your
crown is going, yeah,

01:50:27.722 --> 01:50:28.680 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'm feeling that.

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm into that.

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:35.550 align:middle line:84%
In 1968, 300,000 people saw
Mary in her light body form

01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
appear over a church in
Cairo, a Coptic Church.

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Several people took photos
of this apparition, Mary

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.072 align:middle line:90%
in her light body form.

01:50:44.072 --> 01:50:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Because she's a rainbow
light body being.

01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:48.840 align:middle line:84%
She can phase in
between dimensions

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.850 align:middle line:84%
and go completely
physical if she wants to

01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:54.660 align:middle line:84%
or stay in her light body
form as she most often does.

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:56.340 align:middle line:84%
She's just like
Quan Yin, remember?

01:50:56.340 --> 01:50:57.750 align:middle line:90%
That's how we started.

01:50:57.750 --> 01:51:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Quan Yin-- all that
imagery emerged from Mary.

01:51:01.230 --> 01:51:05.987 align:middle line:84%
So blessed are the pure in
heart, for they will see God.

01:51:05.987 --> 01:51:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Not some dirty, old white man
on a throne that everybody

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.100 align:middle line:84%
hates or have been
so turned off by,

01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:16.270 align:middle line:84%
but they'll see God in the form
of light beings, apparitions,

01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:18.910 align:middle line:90%
full-spectrum beings.

01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:21.160 align:middle line:84%
This is another
important Catholic image.

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Jesus,
I Trust in You."

01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The story behind this is
that there was a nun--

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Saint Faustina.

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:28.960 align:middle line:90%
She was later canonized.

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:32.920 align:middle line:84%
In February 1931,
Jesus appeared to her

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.910 align:middle line:84%
as an apparition in her
cell and stated that--

01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:38.020 align:middle line:90%
she was in her cell.

01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus appeared
to her, she said.

01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus directed her to
paint an image according

01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.130 align:middle line:90%
to the pattern you see.

01:51:46.130 --> 01:51:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Paint an image
according to the pattern

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:51.670 align:middle line:84%
you see with the signature,
"Jesus, I Trust in You."

01:51:51.670 --> 01:51:56.590 align:middle line:84%
He attached many promises to
those who venerate this image.

01:51:56.590 --> 01:52:01.640 align:middle line:84%
The word venerate means to
love or adore this image.

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:06.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you come to this image
with love, Jesus is saying,

01:52:06.190 --> 01:52:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm busy.

01:52:08.490 --> 01:52:09.847 align:middle line:90%
Make this painting of me.

01:52:09.847 --> 01:52:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And everybody who
looks before it will

01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:13.020 align:middle line:90%
be standing in my presence.

01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I will transmit to
them, all who adore it,

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:21.705 align:middle line:84%
the higher frequencies of
love and Christ Consciousness.

01:52:21.705 --> 01:52:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Paint an image
according to the pattern

01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you see with the signature
"Jesus, I Trust in You."

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I desire, he said, that this
image be venerated, loved,

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and adored first in your chapel,
then throughout the world.

01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:35.630 align:middle line:84%
I promise, he said, that
the soul that will venerate

01:52:35.630 --> 01:52:38.720 align:middle line:90%
this image will not perish.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The use of art as a
conduit between the sacred

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and the divine, perfectly
accepted in Catholicism.

01:52:44.210 --> 01:52:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And now, we know how
it actually works

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and why it actually works.

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I am offering people
a vessel with which

01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:52.130 align:middle line:84%
they are to keep
coming for graces

01:52:52.130 --> 01:52:53.510 align:middle line:90%
to the fountain of mercy.

01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:57.200 align:middle line:84%
That vessel is this image
with the signature, "Jesus,

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I Trust in You."

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:01.880 align:middle line:90%
it's incredible.

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mario Martinez is
a national psychologist

01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:07.610 align:middle line:84%
who studies stigmatas for
the Vatican-- went all

01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:09.380 align:middle line:84%
around the world and
talked with people

01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:11.870 align:middle line:84%
who claim that they
received the stigmata

01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:14.870 align:middle line:84%
wounds of Christ-- the five
wounds of the crucifixion.

01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:19.130 align:middle line:84%
He demonstrated that one
woman exhibited the stigmata

01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:25.140 align:middle line:84%
after obsessively reading
about the crucifixion, right?

01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:29.400 align:middle line:84%
He says where the mind
goes, the biology follows.

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:35.220 align:middle line:84%
Where the soul or our core
goes, the biology follows.

01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So if your soul is deeply
connecting with these images,

01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:40.290 align:middle line:90%
your biology will follow.

01:53:40.290 --> 01:53:42.030 align:middle line:90%
That's science.

01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:43.860 align:middle line:90%
That's science, OK?

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:49.170 align:middle line:84%
The art and science
of living ascension.

01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:51.150 align:middle line:90%
This is how we do it.

01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:53.910 align:middle line:84%
By looking at art, depicting
divinity and ascended beings,

01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:57.030 align:middle line:84%
can we become whole,
holy, divine, and ascend?

01:53:57.030 --> 01:54:00.300 align:middle line:90%
Science says, yes, you can.

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Science says, yes, you can.

01:54:01.950 --> 01:54:04.410 align:middle line:10%
It was only in 1991 that
neuroscientists discovered

01:54:04.410 --> 01:54:06.690 align:middle line:10%
that new neurons are
continually being

01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:09.927 align:middle line:10%
generated in the adult
brain, this facility to--

01:54:09.927 --> 01:54:11.760 align:middle line:10%
whether by creating new
neuronal connections

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:13.470 align:middle line:10%
or reinforcing existing ones.

01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:15.750 align:middle line:84%
It's, of course, called
brain plasticity.

01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:16.830 align:middle line:90%
You've seen Bruce Lipton.

01:54:16.830 --> 01:54:19.150 align:middle line:84%
You've seen Joe
Dispenza, Gregg Braden.

01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:22.170 align:middle line:84%
You've seen everybody
presenting this science.

01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.155 align:middle line:10%
I don't need to go
back into the details.

01:54:24.155 --> 01:54:25.530 align:middle line:84%
What I am going
to suggest to you

01:54:25.530 --> 01:54:27.630 align:middle line:90%
is that this is the next step.

01:54:27.630 --> 01:54:30.610 align:middle line:90%
This is why you want to do this.

01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:32.520 align:middle line:84%
It's not to manifest
a new Porsche,

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:34.950 align:middle line:84%
or to get a new
house, or a new job,

01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:37.780 align:middle line:90%
or all of that kind of stuff.

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is why you're learning
about neuroplasticity.

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:43.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why you're
following Joe Dispenza

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and going into
deep gamma, right?

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:48.100 align:middle line:90%
This is why you are doing this.

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:50.730 align:middle line:90%
This is the point, OK?

01:54:50.730 --> 01:54:53.103 align:middle line:10%
The study of musicians who
have played 10,000 hours

01:54:53.103 --> 01:54:55.020 align:middle line:10%
on their instruments
have shown, for instance,

01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:56.687 align:middle line:10%
that the area of the
brain that controls

01:54:56.687 --> 01:55:00.000 align:middle line:10%
the movement of fingers had
been considerably enhanced.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.550 align:middle line:10%
What if we stared at a painting
of the "Transfiguration"

01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:04.770 align:middle line:10%
for 10,000 hours?

01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:08.310 align:middle line:10%
Science says your brain--

01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:10.170 align:middle line:10%
those centers will be activated.

01:55:10.170 --> 01:55:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Could mind training
directed at increasing

01:55:12.090 --> 01:55:14.340 align:middle line:84%
mental states such as
altruism, compassion,

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
inner calm, and patient
result in changes

01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:17.640 align:middle line:90%
of similar magnitude?

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:18.480 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:23.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what new research
is trying to investigate.

01:55:23.070 --> 01:55:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what all of
these artistic traditions

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.000 align:middle line:90%
have been saying.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.330 align:middle line:84%
In Korea, the paintings in
the [? Muism ?] or the Shaman

01:55:30.330 --> 01:55:32.823 align:middle line:90%
Shrine are animated images.

01:55:32.823 --> 01:55:34.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call
them-- animated images.

01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:36.390 align:middle line:84%
There are scholarly
papers about all this.

01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And most of the work that
I'm presenting to you now

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.390 align:middle line:84%
are from the academic level,
from the PhD level, OK?

01:55:42.390 --> 01:55:45.793 align:middle line:84%
Where neuroscientists
or art aficionados,

01:55:45.793 --> 01:55:47.460 align:middle line:84%
scholars are looking
at this and they're

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:51.720 align:middle line:84%
saying this is what is actually
happening with this artwork,

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that these animated images are
objects entered by the gods.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:59.160 align:middle line:84%
When the shaman
invites them in--

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.060 align:middle line:90%
another key.

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.643 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking
at a transfiguration

01:56:01.643 --> 01:56:05.010 align:middle line:84%
image of Jesus or
Padmasambhava, invite them in.

01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Invite them in.

01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:08.970 align:middle line:84%
They're not just going
to knock on your door.

01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:10.530 align:middle line:90%
We have to invite them in.

01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Invite them in and who
operate through the painting.

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And allow the shaman to
enter the divine realm.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:20.290 align:middle line:90%


01:56:20.290 --> 01:56:22.710 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The divine being can enter this
realm through the painting.

01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can go to their
realm through the painting?

01:56:31.410 --> 01:56:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, this is what
they're saying.

01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:36.000 align:middle line:90%
This is what they are saying.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.320 align:middle line:84%
The paintings are a divine
prosthesis an avatar

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and are viewed as an
extension of the gods' ability

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to move in and engage
in the mortal world.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.580 align:middle line:90%
They're busy people, right?

01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:53.410 align:middle line:10%
I'll just send a painting, OK?

01:56:53.410 --> 01:56:54.890 align:middle line:10%
I'll just send a painting.

01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:57.930 align:middle line:10%
The god who is
otherwise invisible

01:56:57.930 --> 01:56:59.820 align:middle line:10%
becomes visible
in material form,

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:05.670 align:middle line:10%
because you've opened your heart
and location through the medium

01:57:05.670 --> 01:57:06.870 align:middle line:10%
of the painting.

01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:08.460 align:middle line:90%
This is quantum physics.

01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:12.510 align:middle line:84%
What is a painting, but a
collection of particles, dots

01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:15.510 align:middle line:90%
of paint that become waves?

01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:18.540 align:middle line:84%
This is quantum science
we're talking about.

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:21.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll elaborate
on this as we go.

01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Invite them in.

01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:28.190 align:middle line:84%
I would love to have the
Amitabha Buddha in my living

01:57:28.190 --> 01:57:30.170 align:middle line:90%
room or my office.

01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:31.310 align:middle line:90%
And I do.

01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:33.560 align:middle line:84%
I just put up a painting
of him and invite him in.

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.520 align:middle line:90%


01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.070 align:middle line:10%
Interaction with sacred
images is a form of dreaming,

01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:45.590 align:middle line:10%
rehearsal for what is to come in
a way to engage with the divine

01:57:45.590 --> 01:57:46.490 align:middle line:10%
beings.

01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:48.883 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're not quite
ready for the Amitabha Buddha

01:57:48.883 --> 01:57:51.050 align:middle line:10%
of Infinite Light to come
walking through that door,

01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:52.910 align:middle line:10%
so we got to rehearse.

01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:55.760 align:middle line:10%
We'd be blown out
of here, right?

01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:58.230 align:middle line:84%
If the resurrected Christ
manifested in this room,

01:57:58.230 --> 01:58:02.090 align:middle line:84%
we would be blown out of
here, so we got to rehearse.

01:58:02.090 --> 01:58:03.140 align:middle line:90%
We've got to practice.

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We've got to elevate our
frequency first and open

01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.080 align:middle line:84%
our heart to be able
to see them and then

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:12.680 align:middle line:84%
be ready for what we're
about to experience.

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:14.990 align:middle line:84%
In the Asian Museum
in San Francisco,

01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:17.330 align:middle line:84%
you'll see beautiful
images of Vishnu

01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:20.240 align:middle line:84%
like this one and
other Hindu images.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The placard beside
this image here

01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:23.600 align:middle line:84%
says, "These Hindu
statues installed

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.270 align:middle line:84%
in various temples were
considered when consecrated,

01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:30.830 align:middle line:84%
made holy to embody
the divine presence.

01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Worshippers were graced by
the divine power in an image

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.610 align:middle line:84%
merely by seeing the image
and at the same time,

01:58:37.610 --> 01:58:41.540 align:middle line:84%
by presenting themselves
to be seen by the divine.

01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:43.190 align:middle line:84%
In their original
settings, many images

01:58:43.190 --> 01:58:45.650 align:middle line:84%
were adorned with fine
cloths, jewels, garlands,

01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:46.785 align:middle line:90%
and sacred powders.

01:58:46.785 --> 01:58:48.410 align:middle line:10%
In worship, they were
cared and honored

01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:50.870 align:middle line:10%
with the presentation of
such items as food, incense,

01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:53.450 align:middle line:10%
flowers, and befitting royal
or honored guests, because they

01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:55.250 align:middle line:10%
are living images."

01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:56.980 align:middle line:84%
This is what a
living image means.

01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:58.130 align:middle line:90%
So here's Vishnu.

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.820 align:middle line:90%
He's standing here.

01:58:59.820 --> 01:59:00.620 align:middle line:90%
He's present.

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And we are now present
before Vishnu as well.

01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:07.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a tanka that was part of
the "Secrets of Tibet" exhibit

01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:10.598 align:middle line:90%
from the Newark museum.

01:59:10.598 --> 01:59:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Came to Nashville
a couple years ago.

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Claire and I went through it,
I think, 4,000 times in two

01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:19.010 align:middle line:90%
months, just to absorb it.

01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Here's the placard
beside this one.

01:59:20.540 --> 01:59:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the "Diamond
World Mandala."

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.350 align:middle line:10%
In the center, we see
the Vairocana Buddha,

01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:25.940 align:middle line:10%
the shining one.

01:59:25.940 --> 01:59:28.760 align:middle line:10%
And then the second
paragraph says,

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.490 align:middle line:10%
"The ritual use of
this painting provides

01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:34.040 align:middle line:10%
portals of interaction
between participants

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:35.660 align:middle line:10%
and these assembled divinities."

01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the most powerful
members of the Pantheon

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.065 align:middle line:90%
as your captive audience.

01:59:39.065 --> 01:59:41.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, for some people, that would
just go right over their heads

01:59:41.690 --> 01:59:43.435 align:middle line:84%
if you're in an
exhibit reading that.

01:59:43.435 --> 01:59:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But from our
perspective, we know

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:46.520 align:middle line:90%
exactly what that means now.

01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:48.270 align:middle line:90%
This is literally a portal.

01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:50.840 align:middle line:90%
The Vairocana Buddha is present.

01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.280 align:middle line:90%
We are seeing him.

01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:55.160 align:middle line:90%
He is-- or she is seeing us.

01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Metropolitan Museum
of Art features

01:59:57.020 --> 01:59:59.600 align:middle line:84%
these raigo, or welcoming
descent paintings,

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.930 align:middle line:84%
of the Amitabha Buddha of
infinite Light descending along

02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:05.450 align:middle line:84%
with a group of bodhisattvas
from the pure land

02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:09.173 align:middle line:84%
to take his soul back to the
pure land on the lotus throne.

02:00:09.173 --> 02:00:11.090 align:middle line:84%
The placard says, "The
scrolls were often hung

02:00:11.090 --> 02:00:13.940 align:middle line:84%
by the bedside of the dying to
ensure the prospect of rebirth

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and paradise.

02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes silken cords were
attached to Buddha's hand,

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:22.280 align:middle line:84%
offering the dying physical
existence during the journey

02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.530 align:middle line:90%
to paradise."

02:00:23.530 --> 02:00:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

02:00:25.850 --> 02:00:28.220 align:middle line:84%
They attach a silken
court to the painting.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
The soul comes out of the
body, grabs a silken cord, off

02:00:30.740 --> 02:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
it goes to the pure land
through the painting.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%


02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:38.820 align:middle line:84%
How many examples
of this do we need

02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to see, before we
really let it sink in

02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:43.770 align:middle line:84%
that this is the key
to our ascension,

02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that there is some
higher dimensional

02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:48.720 align:middle line:84%
reality in which
these beings dwell,

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can connect with
through the painting?

02:00:52.590 --> 02:00:54.600 align:middle line:84%
According to the gnostics,
in order to converge

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
or beam through all that is,
we need a chariot to ride upon,

02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.010 align:middle line:90%
a heavenly lotus throne.

02:00:59.010 --> 02:01:00.960 align:middle line:90%
And we need a beaming garment.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is what this
art is designed to do.

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:05.940 align:middle line:10%
It's to give us a new
scientific view of how

02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:08.430 align:middle line:10%
we attain our
rainbow light body,

02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
our perfect garment of
light through visualization,

02:01:12.090 --> 02:01:14.870 align:middle line:10%
through connecting
with the image.

02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen this
message over and over

02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
again today, crossing over from
the Buddhist, to the Christian,

02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to the Hindu, to the
Tibetan tradition.

02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I can cite more
Egyptian examples.

02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I can cite you Mayan examples.

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And the explanation for how this
works is quantum entanglement.

02:01:33.150 --> 02:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
When two particles are
entangled, they are connected.

02:01:36.540 --> 02:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
A measurement on one immediately
changes the state of the other,

02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
no matter how far
apart they are.

02:01:42.690 --> 02:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Einstein himself thought
this phenomena was so crazy.

02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It was spooky.

02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was no way it
could possibly be true,

02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:51.450 align:middle line:90%
but it is true.

02:01:51.450 --> 02:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
We have proven this now.

02:01:52.890 --> 02:01:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And it implies that everything
in the universe is connected.

02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And if there was a
Big Bang, it happened

02:01:58.170 --> 02:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
when all physical matter was
one and then exploded out

02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
into little pieces that
spread throughout the cosmos.

02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning, you,
and me, and Vairocana Buddha,

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
the Amitabha Buddha of Infinite
Light, Christ, Padmasambhava--

02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:14.380 align:middle line:90%
were all one.

02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:16.210 align:middle line:90%
That means we're entangled.

02:02:16.210 --> 02:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
That means, instantaneously,
Padmasambhava

02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
can send or transmit
a message to us

02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:26.527 align:middle line:84%
across dimensions, across
galaxies instantaneously.

02:02:26.527 --> 02:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to leave
you with an image here

02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of Pallas Athena, created
by Sandro Bottivelli,

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:37.210 align:middle line:84%
after the Medici family had
spent a huge amount of money

02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:41.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to recover the secrets
of original Christianity.

02:02:41.320 --> 02:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
We see Pallas Athena in her
transparent linen garment

02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:47.620 align:middle line:90%
symbolic of her light body.

02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
She's got
diamond-tipped nipples.

02:02:49.810 --> 02:02:53.080 align:middle line:84%
She's got a diamond
on her crown chakra.

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.340 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
sunlight hits a diamond?

02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't you see a rainbow prism?

02:02:58.180 --> 02:02:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is how--

02:02:59.490 --> 02:03:02.370 align:middle line:84%
another way of encoding
the rainbow light body.

02:03:02.370 --> 02:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's got the symbol
of quantum entanglement

02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
all over her robe,
which actually

02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
became the logo of the Medici
family and also Michelangelo.

02:03:11.370 --> 02:03:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So they clearly had tapped
into some extraordinary mystic

02:03:16.150 --> 02:03:16.950 align:middle line:90%
secrets.

02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And they encoded this
in their sacred art.

02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And here, you see the diamond
tip on Athena's crown chakra.

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very good example
of the divine feminine

02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
exemplifying or modeling
the light body and quantum

02:03:29.850 --> 02:03:30.690 align:middle line:90%
entanglement.

02:03:30.690 --> 02:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank Quan
Yin for opening our hearts,

02:03:34.650 --> 02:03:35.750 align:middle line:90%
opening our way to this.

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:37.215 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you for
being there to receive it.

02:03:37.215 --> 02:03:38.015 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]
