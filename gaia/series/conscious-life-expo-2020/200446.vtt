>> Let's give William
a big, big hand.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, William.

>> All right, thank
you, everybody.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to cover
a lot of ground

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:84%
today, so just enjoy
and bear with me.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:90%
So AI and the new humanity.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:10%
That's our subject.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:10%
My premise is that we are
right now experiencing

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.410 align:middle line:10%
a humanitarian crisis that
is immense, that we are all

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:10%
experiencing at this moment.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:90%
We are the participants.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We are the deciders.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And this event that is
upon us, this crisis,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:84%
will lead to either the
ascension of our species

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
or possibly, without
being overly dramatic,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the destruction, the
extinction of our species.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not climate change.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.863 align:middle line:90%
It's worse.

00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:10%
What I'm going to be
talking about today

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.210 align:middle line:10%
is our merger, the
blurring or blending

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:10%
of our bodies and our planet,
with artificial intelligence,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
with machine intelligence,
with algorithms.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:84%
With an intelligence
that is rapidly

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
approaching a point where it
will accelerate to the point

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.180 align:middle line:84%
where it is so far
beyond humanity

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that we won't even
have any comprehension

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:90%
of this level of intelligence.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:90%
That's called the singularity.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of your
best forecasters

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.190 align:middle line:84%
tell us that that's
less than 10 years away.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Coincidental, of
course, with the climate

have less than 12 years

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
to correct our climate
change crisis as well.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The two actually
are intertwined.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.026 align:middle line:90%
They go hand in hand.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:10%
Think about that.

That's what
technology really is.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:10%
It's possibility.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:10%
It's adaptability.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:10%
It's capability.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.160 align:middle line:10%
But in the end,
it's only a tool.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:10%
What's a hammer without
a person who swings it?

It's not about what
technology can do.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:10%
It's about what
you can do with it.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:10%
You're the voice, and
it's the microphone.

want anything to do with it?

And the answer is no.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:90%
We really don't.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.642 align:middle line:84%
And these corporations
like Microsoft

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and some of the others
we're going to see

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:84%
are spending hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%

be the future of humanity,

that AI is just a
tool like a hammer.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Does your hammer speak to you?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Does your hammer make
decisions for you or about you?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Does your hammer go on--

your life and communicating

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and negotiating with
governments and corporations?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:90%
No, it doesn't.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:90%
AI is not just a tool.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.257 align:middle line:90%
It is an entity unto its own.

00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that I want you
to be thinking about as we

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.705 align:middle line:84%
develop this is
that, I mean, this

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:90%
was a wonderful commercial.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:84%
I love Common,
really interesting.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But it reminded me of that
time when Satan took Jesus up

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the high tower and
said, all of this can be yours.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.780 align:middle line:84%
That is what AI
is offering to us.

that they're saying
AI is our friend.

but I'm personally,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to tell
you very directly,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's

This isn't a new subject for me.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge subject in
our world right now.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But I actually began looking
into AI and our merger

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.870 align:middle line:84%
with technology
back around 2000.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I published a book
in 2003 called

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:90%
"The Cloak of the Illuminati".

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And in this book,
I had been looking

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
at depictions of the ancient
gods, extraterrestrial beings,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
purportedly, who came to Earth.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And the distinguishing
thing that they possessed

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
was a cloak or a garment,
a miracle garment

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.000 align:middle line:84%
called the [? melamu ?],,
that made them superhumans,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
made them giants,
gave them superpowers.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:90%
They could be invisible.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:90%
They could radiate light.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
They could leap over buildings.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They were super beings because
of this incredible garment.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But it also was something
they could transmit to humans.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
In the oldest stories
about these garments,

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
humans would be able to
receive this cloak or garment

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
from the gods, and humans could
then become gods themselves

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.212 align:middle line:90%
because they possessed this.

00:05:36.212 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
I first learned about it
from Zecharia Sitchin,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
who thought that this garment
here on the Anunnaki goddess

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Inanna was like a
space suit that she

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.740 align:middle line:84%
would put on preparatory
to going into space.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it was
more about her ascension

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
into a light being,
as it turns out.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But it put me on the track of
saying, OK, there's a cloak,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:84%
there's a garment,
that the gods possess

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that gives them a
super power that

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
is transmittable to humans.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:10%
I've followed this story into
the Egyptian tradition, where

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.350 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptian Resurrection
mysteries are based

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.170 align:middle line:10%
on the belief in
the actual science

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:10%
that they could
use tones, lights,

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:10%
and an as-yet-unidentified
plant to kickstart

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:10%
the production of hormones,
similar to ecdysone that morph

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:10%
a caterpillar into a
butterfly, and the Egyptians

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.275 align:middle line:10%
could then create a
non-molecular light body

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:10%
into which their
consciousness could be

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:10%
deposited at the time of death.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And then they could continue
on as an eternal being,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:10%
as a star walker with
full consciousness

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:10%
and memories of
their Earth life.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:10%
And so that was a
very important piece,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:10%
to say that they
could actually create

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:10%
this garment, this non-molecular
light body, a new skin,

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:10%
and copy and paste
their consciousness

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:10%
into that light
body and continue.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I followed this into the
Israelite tradition, followed

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it into the Jewish mystical
tradition with the Essenes,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
who believed that
in order to enter

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.170 align:middle line:84%
into the celestial
realms, to ascend or even

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
to go into outer
space, actually,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
we had to become
like the angels.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
We had to transform from a human
into an angelic type of being.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
This transformation
was symbolized

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
by a robe of pure white
light or white linen,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and it was attained
through the perfection,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and please note that word,
we'll use it many times

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
as we continue, the
perfection of our body

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
into a being of light, just
like the Egyptians were talking.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, just like the
Sumerians were talking as well.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes claimed to be
experts in this transformation.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Revelation,
John the Revelator

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.110 align:middle line:84%
espouses Essene belief
when he says, "blessed

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.847 align:middle line:84%
are those who washed their
robes so that they will have

00:07:43.847 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:84%
the right to the
tree of life, and may

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.010 align:middle line:84%
enter the new
Jerusalem," which they

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.900 align:middle line:90%
viewed as a celestial city.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is a transformation
of a human into an angel

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a beautiful painting
by Arthur Hacker showing

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Mary wearing this bright
white garment symbolic

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of her transformation
into the light body.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.142 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian
tradition, and I'm

00:08:06.142 --> 00:08:07.600 align:middle line:84%
going to go into
this a little bit,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
because transhumanism actually
comes out of Christianity

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
in its original belief
system as we'll see,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
but in Christianity,
they were going

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
to ascend to a new Jerusalem,
a celestial place of a higher

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.100 align:middle line:84%
frequency domain
where beings were

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
in non-physical light bodies,
non-molecular light bodies,

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:84%
just like the
Egyptians described.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:84%
And in artwork, that is
symbolized once again

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
by this white robe
or garment of light,

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
similar to what we saw in
the Sumerian tradition.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, of course, modeled
this in his transfiguration

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.640 align:middle line:84%
when he morphed
into a light being

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
in front of several disciples,
demonstrating to them

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
this natural, organic capability
that all humans have to,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
from deep within our
bodies, to exude light,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
to exude superpowers, and to
activate latent capabilities

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:90%
within our DNA.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian tradition,
the mystic Jewish tradition,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
this garment is called
the robe of light,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
the robe of sanctity, the robe
of glory, the shining garment,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
the garment of light,
and the beaming garment.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:84%
As you acquire this, or actually
manifest it from within,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
it gives you
superpowers of strength,

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:84%
of vastly improved intelligence,
the privileged of superpowers.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is one
of the motivations

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:90%
for following this pathway.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate destination,
of course, or use for this,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
is to ascend from
the Earth plane

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and become an
eternal cosmic being.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And then this gets picked
up in Christian prophecy,

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
where we're told at
some future point,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.460 align:middle line:84%
humanity will be
changed in a moment,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
in a twinkling of an
eye, at the last trump.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:10%
For the trump will
sound, that debt

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.990 align:middle line:10%
will be raised imperishable,
and we shall be changed.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a future moment that
they're describing here,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
when a tone, a wave, or
reverberation, that's

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
what the word trump means,
comes over the planet

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:90%
and begins to transform us.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Some will readily adapt to this
new frequency or vibration.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Others will cower
in fear over it.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:90%
They won't be able to handle it.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Many believe we're
in that moment

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
now, where a new frequency
is coming on the planet.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are better adapted
to rise with that frequency

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and move into an
ascended state of being.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Others are not quite so
sure what's going on.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:10%
As we follow this
painting by Fra Angelico,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:10%
we see a group of adepts
who are doing a rain dance

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.750 align:middle line:10%
around a portal or a gateway.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.490 align:middle line:10%
And they're in
preparation for going

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:10%
through this gate or portal
filled with light, which

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.430 align:middle line:10%
is actually the gateway
to the new Jerusalem,

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:10%
this celestial city and this
elevated state of being,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.460 align:middle line:10%
exemplified here by
Mary, the Virgin Mary,

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.090 align:middle line:10%
wearing her cloak of stars,
which is that robe of light,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:10%
indicated that she has
completed her ascension.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, she's the first
Christian to ascend.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And what she's doing is
she's elevating her frequency

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to the point where she becomes
a fully Christed type being,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
a fully embodied light being.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.520 align:middle line:84%
They call this the
resurrection body, the glory

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.080 align:middle line:90%
body, the Christ body.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
There are numerous names
for this state of being.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And this, again, is very
critical for us to understand,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.270 align:middle line:84%
because this is
the first shoe that

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
drops in terms of telling
us that we can transform.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And transhumanism
and AI is actually

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
an answer to this very
prophecy and this premise.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
At the core of it is something
that we must very definitely

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
understand, and that
is in mystical Judaism

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:84%
and Christianity,
and even in Islam,

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and this is a belief
subscribed to by about 4

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 billion
people on this planet,

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
they believe that
when Adam and Eve,

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
the original archetypal humans,
lived in the Garden of Eden,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:84%
a place of pure
light and pure love,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
we did not have flesh
and blood bodies.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:84%
We had bodies of light,
non-molecular light bodies.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And this was described in the
"Zohar" as a celestial garment,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the garment of
heavenly light, light

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of that light which was
used in the Garden of Eden.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the same cloak that I
was describing in my earlier

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
book as tracing through
the Sumerians, Egyptians,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:90%
and the early Christians.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And here in this
painting by Giotto,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.130 align:middle line:84%
in the Church of San
Francesco in Assisi, Italy,

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.700 align:middle line:90%
we see Adam as a being of light.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And the premise
here is that this is

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:90%
our original status as souls.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:10%
We were not in flesh and blood
bodies till after the fall,

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:10%
and that all of human
history is actually a quest

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:10%
to return to our original
state as light beings,

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:10%
to escape the flesh.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:10%
Of course, what AI and
transhumanism is doing

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:10%
is mummifying the flesh,
trying to persuade

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:10%
us to pack our bodies
full of technology

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:10%
so that we can stick around
on this planet for hundreds

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:10%
of years.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Our quest is not to become
amortal or immortal, even.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Our quest is to ascend, to get
back to our original place.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is the premise
of the second coming when

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:84%
we will be changed
in the twinkling

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of an eye at the last trump.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we're going to
be changed into 5 foot 10 inch

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Jewish men with long
hair and a long beard

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.270 align:middle line:84%
like you see on the
Shroud of Turin.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It means we will be changed into
our original light body form.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And you know Jesus is in
his Resurrection body,

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:84%
or his light body, his
glory body, in Christian art

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.710 align:middle line:84%
when he's got a rainbow
around his body.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, early on, I started
matching that Christian concept

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:10%
with the Tibetan concept
of the great perfection.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:10%
The Tibetans tell
us that our body

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.260 align:middle line:10%
was designed to have its
frequency accelerated until it

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:10%
dissolves into its natural
essence, its true nature, which

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.863 align:middle line:10%
is a five-colored
rainbow light body, which

00:14:01.863 --> 00:14:04.030 align:middle line:10%
is what you see here in
this depiction on the right.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same as
the glory or resurrection

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
body of Jesus, the
light body of Jesus.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:10%
This happens to be
Padmasambhava, a Tibetan guru

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.590 align:middle line:10%
who manifested on
the Earth plane

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.580 align:middle line:10%
and taught the teachings of the
light body, the rainbow light

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:10%
body, to the Tibetans.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:10%
The gospel of Philip,
a Gnostic Gospel,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:10%
says "the Lord
rose from the dead.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.480 align:middle line:10%
He became as he was, but
now his body was perfect."

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:10%
There's that word perfect again.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:10%
We've used it several times now.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.010 align:middle line:10%
"He possessed flesh,
but this was true flesh.

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:10%
Our flesh isn't true.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:10%
Ours is only an
image of the true."

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:10%
So our flesh and blood
bodies are merely

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.555 align:middle line:10%
an image of our true selves that
we're trying to get back to.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:52.180 align:middle line:84%
This is very important, because
as we're going to develop here,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.060 align:middle line:84%
what AI and transhumanism
is attempting to do

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
is to create a duplicate
version of the human body,

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
another iteration
of the human body

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:84%
that's not composed of strictly
or exclusively flesh and blood

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and actually has little to do
with our original true nature

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
as beings of light and love.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So here we see
that correspondence

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
between the Tibetan
rainbow light body

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.325 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus and his
resurrection body.

00:15:18.325 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:10%
All of human history is a quest
for our ascension to a higher

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.140 align:middle line:10%
state of consciousness
and our return

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:10%
to our original true nature,
the light body, the rainbow

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:10%
light body.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.670 align:middle line:10%
The question is,
how do we do that?

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:10%
And right now, we
have two tracks

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:10%
that are being presented to
us, the organic, natural way,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:10%
or the transhuman,
inorganic, technological way.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that
they intertwine.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm really not.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle line:84%
I hold the door open
about that much.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:52.135 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
why as we continue.

00:15:52.135 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.480 align:middle line:90%
So in my path, it's 2002.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm researching this cloak.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Here drops a document
from the US government,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:84%
actually from the United States
National Science Foundation

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.280 align:middle line:90%
and Department of Commerce.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You can get this
document online.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It's available in PDF format.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Converging
Technologies for Improving

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Human Performance".

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Basically what happened is that
the US government got together

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
with all the top technology
people at that time, Microsoft,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Google, so forth, took
them to Hawaii, and said,

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:84%
y'all, you all are involved
in four separate technologies.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are developing
bits or computer technology.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are developing
atoms or nanotechnology.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are studying
the brain or neuroscience.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of you are
involved in genetics.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.710 align:middle line:84%
What the US government
wants you to do

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:84%
is to begin to merge all four
of those separate technologies

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
into one seamless technology,
and aim it at the human skin,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.820 align:middle line:84%
creating a new layer
of skin for humanity.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.032 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's the rub.

00:17:00.032 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They're wanting to
build a robe of light.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
They are mimicking exactly
what the garment of light

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:90%
can do, technologically.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this exciting?

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
What they said was
that potential uses

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of these technologies in
improving health and overcoming

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:84%
disability are
discussed in the report,

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:22.079 align:middle line:84%
and that they want to create
a human-machine interface.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
The reason for doing
this was to enable

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:84%
the creation of a new species
of intelligent machine systems

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that can generate economic
wealth on a scale hitherto

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:90%
unimaginable.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
What is the motivation for
turning us into machines?

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%
Money.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
We're all being put on the
altar of Silicon Valley

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.830 align:middle line:84%
so we can make
trillions of dollars,

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
to make trillions of dollars.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And usher in, oh by the way, a
golden age for all humankind.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, back in 2002
as I'm reading this,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, bits,
atoms, neurons, and genes.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that Earth,
air, fire, and water

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.740 align:middle line:90%
retooled at a digital level?

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if this is correspondent
with Earth, air, fire,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.010 align:middle line:90%
and water, what's missing?

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Spirit.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Where's the soul in all this?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, as I'm going to explain to
you, these people are atheists.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That idea that you have, that
quaint idea that you have

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
that you are a soul
inhabiting a human body,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle line:90%
is folklore and superstition.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And they are going to
eradicate that kind of speech

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.405 align:middle line:84%
from we idiots who still hold
on to these ancient concepts.

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:84%
In 2003, Dr. Natasha
Vita-More a brilliant woman,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
comes along with her whole-body
prosthetic and substrate

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.300 align:middle line:84%
autonomous networked
avatar body by design.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Basically, the premise
is your body sucks.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:10%
It stinks.

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:10%
It creates gaseous waste
that needs to be recycled.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.240 align:middle line:10%
You're really stupid, because
you have a one-track mind.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.493 align:middle line:10%
You can't really multitask.

00:18:53.493 --> 00:18:55.660 align:middle line:10%
And you've got all kinds
of problems with this body.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:10%
It's fragile, and it
has a limited lifespan.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:10%
Why would you want
one of these things?

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:10%
What we're going to do is
create the new primo posthuman

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.490 align:middle line:10%
with smart skin.

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:09.280 align:middle line:10%
We're going to start printing
new replacement organs for you.

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.820 align:middle line:10%
We're going to sprinkle a little
smart dust in your neocortex.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:10%
We're going to wire you
up to this global brain,

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:10%
and you will now be
a primo posthuman

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.610 align:middle line:10%
rather than old and stinky.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's going to
want one of these things.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:90%
That was the premise.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%
That was 2003.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:10%
So as my research continues, I
won't bore you with the interim

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:10%
time between '03 and 2014 when
I published "The Skingularity Is

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:10%
Near" which is about the
enmeshment of our flesh with

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:10%
this technology.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:10%
This is a free e-book
that's available on my web

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:46.210 align:middle line:10%
site, williamhenry.net.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:10%
Tens of thousands of
people have grabbed this

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:10%
and passed it around.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.325 align:middle line:10%
I'm very grateful for that.

00:19:51.325 --> 00:19:53.710 align:middle line:84%
That was my intention,
was to in one document,

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:90%
get you up to speed with.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:90%
Here are the developments.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.250 align:middle line:84%
This book is
essentially obsolete,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
because it is five years
old now, six years old now.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And the data in it is
very relevant in terms

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
of the timeline,
but my forecasts

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what was coming
have been vastly superseded.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:15.070 align:middle line:84%
They are way beyond what
I presented in that book.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing that I
brought forward in that

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
is to say that it's this
choice that we have.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
We can go with this rainbow
spectrum of bits, atoms,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
neurons, and genes, and mesh
our flesh with technology

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to attain ultimate
intelligence and illumination,

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:90%
or we can remain organic beings.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is still the
clear choice that we have,

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
either to remain organic
humans, or to take that step

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and to become posthuman or
transhumans, H+, I am +, H2.0.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
They can't agree on the
next iteration of humanity,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:84%
but they all have
this idea that we're

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.810 align:middle line:90%
going to be somehow enhanced.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be actually more
human when we become machines.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:90%
That's their logic.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So in the book, I talked
about how the spiritual aspect

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:90%
of this is being mimicked.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:10%
In the book of Ephesians,
Paul is in prison in Rome.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:10%
It's AD 62, and he's telling
Christians in Ephesus

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:10%
in Turkey of a coming battle.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.160 align:middle line:10%
There's a coming battle
in which Christians

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.490 align:middle line:10%
need to be strong in the
Lord and his mighty power.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:10%
And the remedy-- he
says that there's

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.970 align:middle line:10%
these dark powers,
the authorities,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.820 align:middle line:10%
the principalities, the
powers, the archons,

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:10%
extraterrestrial entities,
according to some,

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:10%
are coming for us, and
they want our soul.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.140 align:middle line:10%
And one of their key
techniques that they have,

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:10%
one of their key
tricks, is simulation.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:10%
They can trick us into maybe
creating a transhuman body,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.830 align:middle line:10%
because they don't have
souls and they want ours.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And so Paul is warning
about this coming battle

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.565 align:middle line:90%
back in 62 AD.

00:21:50.565 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And he says there's only one
way you can get around this.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:10%
He says you've got to put
on the full armor of God.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:10%
And he describes
this as including

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:10%
the crown of salvation, the
breastplate of righteousness,

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:10%
the belt of truth,
the sandals of peace,

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:10%
and creating a shield of
faith around your body.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:10%
What he's talking about is
augmenting the human body.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.760 align:middle line:10%
He's talking about
putting on armor

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:18.800 align:middle line:10%
to combat a cosmic entity,
these archons, these powers.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is, as I'm
looking at that, I'm thinking,

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.670 align:middle line:84%
OK, he's writing to multitudes
of people in Ephesus.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.640 align:middle line:84%
He can't really be telling them
to hike it down to Nordstrom

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and get the latest Chanel
breastplate of righteousness,

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
which is made of gold
and precious jewels,

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
because not everybody in
Ephesus can go get the latest

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Armani or Chanel suit, right?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:90%
And same with that crown.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:90%
He must be talking about what?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:90%
These are symbols.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.570 align:middle line:84%
He's saying activate
your crown chakra.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
Open your heart.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Live a righteous,
heart-centered life.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Speak truth, that's exactly
what the belt of truth

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.540 align:middle line:90%
is, and walk in peace.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.920 align:middle line:90%
All of us can do that.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And this premise is that
if you do those things,

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:90%
you will raise your frequency.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And these archon beings,
they won't even see it.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You'll just breeze
through TSA when

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.900 align:middle line:90%
you go through the airport.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
They won't even know
you're there, right?

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Don Juan had a conversation
with Carlos Castaneda

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
about this very thing, warned
about this exact same group

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.708 align:middle line:84%
of beings, and
said, all you've got

00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:84%
to do is get your rainbow body
up to the level of your toes,

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.520 align:middle line:90%
and they won't see you.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you think that maybe
attaining the rainbow body,

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
dissolving yourself into
light is a little too much

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to do on a Sunday
morning, just bring it up

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to the level of
your toes, and that

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:38.120 align:middle line:84%
could be enough to keep these
negative and harmful entities

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:90%
at bay.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
But the key point is
that we are talking

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
about augmenting the human
body to combat a negative force

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.830 align:middle line:90%
or entity.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Here's our warriors today.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Every time I see a girl in
her yoga pants in the airport

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.040 align:middle line:84%
or wherever I am, I'm
thinking, yes, thank god,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.205 align:middle line:84%
because there are
tens of millions

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:84%
of people around
the planet right

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:84%
now who are developing
their organic light

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.640 align:middle line:84%
body through meditation, through
yoga, through proper diet,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.140 align:middle line:90%
through proper thought.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.450 align:middle line:90%
These are our warriors.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.600 align:middle line:84%
They are on the front
line of combating

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
these negative entities that
want to turn us into machines.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And whether every
woman and man who

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.300 align:middle line:84%
is doing yoga today
at this moment

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
realizes she has the
potential, as the White Tara is

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.780 align:middle line:84%
demonstrating here, to morph
into a rainbow light body

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.520 align:middle line:90%
or not, it doesn't matter.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
She is still holding
that frequency,

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.500 align:middle line:84%
attaining that
level, and committed

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.190 align:middle line:84%
to an organic
ascension rather than

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:90%
a transhuman or a digital one.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing,
she's keeping control

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.820 align:middle line:90%
of her life and her soul.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to bring in this
climate change bit now,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because it brings a bigger
picture to what is actually

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:90%
happening with AI.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Since the last climate
change catastrophe,

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and I'm talking the end
of the Younger Dryas,

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:09.530 align:middle line:84%
10,000 BC, 12,000 years ago,
when there were two competing

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:90%
humans on the planet.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.990 align:middle line:84%
You had Neanderthal,
short, stocky, thick nose,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.150 align:middle line:84%
well-adapted to
living in the cold.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.233 align:middle line:84%
But climate change happened, and
the planet started to heat up.

00:25:21.233 --> 00:25:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And poor little Neanderthal
is running around,

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.990 align:middle line:84%
going I'm not adapted for
life in this circumstance.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:84%
And here comes the fast-moving
slimmer Homo sapiens coming up

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
out of Africa,
and they mate, OK?

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
end of Neanderthal.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm introducing this
because, not to be negative,

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
but we are in the
same relative position

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
right now as Neanderthal was at
the end of the Younger Dryas,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.910 align:middle line:84%
of facing extinction
and elimination,

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
because we can't cope
with climate change.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And climate change is being
now used as the premise

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
for turning ourselves
into machines

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and for turning our planet
into a machine as well.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
We now live on every
continent and have directly

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:84%
affected at least 83% of our
planet's visible land surface.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.870 align:middle line:84%
During Jesus's time, there
were 170 million people

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.100 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Today, there's nearly
8 billion of us.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Our influence has
impacted everything,

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from the makeup of ecosystems,
to the geochemistry

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
of Earth and the
atmosphere, to the ocean.

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And scientists define this
time now as the Anthropocene.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.630 align:middle line:90%
We were in the Holocene.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Now we're in a time
period, an era,

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.830 align:middle line:84%
in which humans are impacting
the planet demonstrably

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and scientifically provably so.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.930 align:middle line:90%
When did the Anthropocene begin?

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Some think it began with the
steam engine in the 1750s.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Others say, no, it's
more like the 1840s, when

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
we started belching pollution
into our atmosphere.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:84%
The first Industrial Revolution
started in London in the 1840s,

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and this is when we started to
exert a discernible influence

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Some say, no, it actually
began in the 1940s

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.740 align:middle line:84%
when we started popping
off nukes, 2,500

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:84%
of them in our atmosphere,
underneath the surface

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
of the planet,
and in the oceans,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
leaving sediments on the Earth
and also a discernible signal

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.950 align:middle line:84%
to any extraterrestrial
civilization out there.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:84%
They would know, OK, humans now
have very powerful firecrackers

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:90%
in their hands.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it was
the 1940s when we

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:90%
entered into this Anthropocene.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Whenever it started, since
the '50s through the '90s,

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.690 align:middle line:84%
we entered the third
Industrial Revolution,

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.360 align:middle line:84%
and we began adding
layers of pollution,

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.920 align:middle line:84%
CO2, plastic, as well as nuclear
and electromagnetic radiation

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:84%
to the atmospheric bubble that
enables life on our Spaceship

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
All of that, of
course, causes cancer.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Even plants are now not immune
to the pollution damage.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Since the 2000s, when we
entered the fourth Industrial

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Revolution, and began
adding layers of 4G

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.600 align:middle line:84%
and now 5G radiation to
our atmospheric bubble,

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.480 align:middle line:84%
we have increasingly been
altering our environment,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
perhaps irreparably so, and we
have begun altering our bodies

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.490 align:middle line:90%
simultaneously.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:19.060 align:middle line:84%
The two go hand-in-hand,
climate change,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:23.880 align:middle line:90%
AI/transhumanism go together.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the Anthropocene
forces us to re-examine

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.240 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
between ourselves

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and our planet in our role in
terms of how we are effectively

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.420 align:middle line:84%
caretaking our planet and if we
are actual effective stewards

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of our planet.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.930 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to 2017, and
a very important document

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.090 align:middle line:90%
published by Dr. Klaus Schwab.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.520 align:middle line:84%
He is the founder
of the Davos meeting

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:84%
in Davos, Switzerland, the
financial meeting every year

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.450 align:middle line:90%
in Switzerland.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And in 2017, he put out this
manifesto, which is in fact,

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.000 align:middle line:84%
literally, and this is
not a conspiracy theory,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
this is the plan for
humanity of the global elite.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.440 align:middle line:84%
All of the glitterati,
Illuminati,

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.590 align:middle line:84%
digerati that gather
at Davos effectively

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:13.430 align:middle line:84%
subscribe to this belief
that we are experiencing

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.360 align:middle line:84%
now a transformation that will
be unlike anything humanity

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.240 align:middle line:90%
has ever experienced before.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least since we went
from our light body phase

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:90%
into our flesh and blood phase.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.430 align:middle line:84%
What Dr. Schwab says is
that this transformation

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
is characterized by the
fusion of technologies that

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:84%
is blurring the lines between
the physical, digital,

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.290 align:middle line:90%
and biological spheres.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:41.330 align:middle line:84%
This is our merger with
AI in order to survive,

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:90%
dot dot dot, climate change.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:84%
The fourth Industrial Revolution
is defined by the disappearing

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.200 align:middle line:84%
boundaries between the
physical, the biological,

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:90%
and the digital spheres.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.590 align:middle line:84%
They're all merging
into one, just

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
like those four technology,
bits, atoms, neurons,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and genes, are merging
into one seamless

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.550 align:middle line:90%
technology in our skin.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:84%
They're breathless with
the possibilities of 7

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and 1/2 billion people
all wired to the internet

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.610 align:middle line:84%
together, with their
brains packed with chips,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:84%
with their eyes packed
with technology,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:84%
with their skin packed
with nanotechnology.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's singing
the new song of how

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:90%
wonderful AI is for humanity.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll have children with brain
stimulators to beat disorders

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.400 align:middle line:90%
like depression and Parkinson's.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we want that.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.830 align:middle line:84%
We really do, but we don't
want it forced upon them.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
We want this to be
something we elect to do,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.982 align:middle line:84%
not that is mandated to do,
and that's the great concern.

00:30:44.982 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:84%
They'll have brain
chips to improve

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.780 align:middle line:90%
multitasking and happiness.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Can't you get happiness
and enhance your brain

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.590 align:middle line:90%
through meditation?

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we teach kids
meditation for 1,000 years,

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll think
about putting chips in?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.020 align:middle line:84%
We'll have augmented eyes
that can detect liars.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we want that.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But we can also do that
intuitively and psychically.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.580 align:middle line:90%
We can do it organically.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Why do I need someone putting
a hammer in my head, right?

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Some tool that's just a tool?

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.450 align:middle line:84%
We can have ear implants
for super hearing.

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Love it.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Love it, love it, love it.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But only in the case of a
life or death situation.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Not as something you go to Best
Buy and have some Geek Squad

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.970 align:middle line:84%
kid remove the
cornea of your eye,

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.470 align:middle line:84%
put a liquid in
there that's packed

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
with a radio and electronics,
so now you can lead Best

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Buy that day with infrared
vision, super vision,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and supervision from AI.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not for me.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a mindset
that goes with this

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.630 align:middle line:84%
that is extremely
important to apprehend,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and this follows along
with our timeline.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It starts in 1953, when
these young guys here,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:04.110 align:middle line:84%
a brilliant geneticist, Francis
Crick and Harold Watson,

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:09.840 align:middle line:84%
discovered the double helix
structure of our DNA .

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And as they said,
as Watson said,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.350 align:middle line:84%
it was so beautiful
that it had to be true.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.600 align:middle line:84%
But what was so
important about this

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.560 align:middle line:84%
is that he came up
with this impression

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:25.680 align:middle line:90%
that our DNA is information.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It's digital.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And what that spawned
was a whole new industry

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.420 align:middle line:84%
of molecular biology
followed along

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.630 align:middle line:84%
with scientific techniques
like recombinant DNA

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.870 align:middle line:84%
research, genetic engineering,
gene sequencing, that

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.390 align:middle line:84%
manifested this multi,
multibillion dollar

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
industry and the
possibility of genetically

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:49.060 align:middle line:90%
altering the human form.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.020 align:middle line:84%
This is a really
important development,

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.700 align:middle line:84%
because Crick himself thought
that there's no way possible

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that the human body
could develop on its own.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.710 align:middle line:84%
He directly stated
that he thought

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that there was extraterrestrial
involvement in the development

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.200 align:middle line:84%
of the human body, that
there's no way possible

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that the nucleotides and the
proteins that were needed

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to create that scenario could
simultaneously have just

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously existed.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:84%
He believed in something
called directed panspermia,

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
that there in fact was an
extraterrestrial entity,

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
a consciousness, that
intervened in human evolution.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.930 align:middle line:84%
What Watson and Crick
showed, or excuse me,

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.720 align:middle line:84%
when Watson and Crick showed
that genes are strings

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of pure digital information,
it brought with it

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.670 align:middle line:84%
a new way of looking at you
and a way of looking at me.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is, you are not some
soft, mushy, spiritual being.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.990 align:middle line:90%
You're data.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.200 align:middle line:84%
You're just information that
can be cut, copied, pasted,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.180 align:middle line:90%
and augmented one day.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what they were hoping
back in the '60s and '70s.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The glowing capstone
on this pyramid

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of what's known as
materialist philosophy

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:03.930 align:middle line:84%
is the work of British atheist
and biologist Richard Dawkins,

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.540 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book called
"The Selfish Gene" published

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
in 1976, which the Royal
Society in England thinks

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
is one of the greatest
books ever published.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.590 align:middle line:90%
"The Selfish Gene."

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:84%
And it advanced this idea
that you are not your body.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
You are just
information or data.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.699 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is important
about you and important for you

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:27.810 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we are
our genes, he said.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.949 align:middle line:84%
It is our genes,
not our bodies, that

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
survive from one
generation to the next.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Our body is simply a container
or vehicle for the gene.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a vehicle by
which it travels,

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and a tool through which
it expresses itself.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:45.639 align:middle line:84%
So your body is now not
the greatest creature

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and creation of God
or a spiritual entity,

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:90%
it's just a tool.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
You're just information, genes,
in a tool, in a container.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Nothing personal, but
you're just matter.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And what we do to your body
doesn't matter, because you're

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.030 align:middle line:90%
just information.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:06.920 align:middle line:84%
This is the mindset,
and it's very important

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.090 align:middle line:90%
to apprehend this.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:12.380 align:middle line:84%
We are our genes and
what they do, period.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.400 align:middle line:90%
End of story.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, says
Dawkins, our genes

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.870 align:middle line:84%
have a selfish drive
or mission to survive

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and to make more genes just as
directed panspermia suggests

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.320 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1966, while the
selfish gene theory was still

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:84%
crystallizing in
Dawkins' mind, he wrote,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.860 align:middle line:84%
"natural selection will
favor those genes that

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.220 align:middle line:84%
build themselves a body which
is most likely to succeed

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.220 align:middle line:84%
in handing down safely
to the next generation

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:41.030 align:middle line:84%
a large number of
replicas of those genes."

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Dawkins is considered a god
in artificial life and AI

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:50.440 align:middle line:84%
circles because of that
statement right there.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Genes build the body for the
mission, and the mission of DNA

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:84%
is to discover its creator and
fulfill its wish to duplicate

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%
itself throughout the cosmos.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Taking his theory further
in "River Out of Eden",

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Dawkins proposed that just
as genes are information

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.200 align:middle line:84%
that manifests life, life itself
is an information process that

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.635 align:middle line:84%
can be copied from
one matrix to another.

00:36:14.635 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
This will become very
important as we develop

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.343 align:middle line:84%
this conversation,
because basically they're

00:36:18.343 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:84%
saying you're information, and
it doesn't matter if you exist

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in this information
packet in this form here,

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.080 align:middle line:84%
or if we just copy and
paste you and stick you

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.350 align:middle line:84%
in some simulated reality in
a black box in Silicon Valley.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Take you out of this matrix,
put you in that matrix.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It does not matter, because
you're just information.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.275 align:middle line:84%
What is missing in
this conversation?

00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:39.910 align:middle line:90%
The soul.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.530 align:middle line:90%
What happened to the soul?

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, darling, you
don't have one.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:90%
You don't have one.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:90%
That's their point of view.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So simply, if life equals genes
and genes equal information,

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.590 align:middle line:90%
then life is information.

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:59.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the thinking that
drives Silicon Valley.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Life is just bytes, says
Dawkins, and bytes and bytes

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:90%
of digital information.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
metaphor, he's saying.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It is the plain truth.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
to do is get over,

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:84%
he says, that we are now
viewed not just as matter only,

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.780 align:middle line:90%
but digital information.

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.110 align:middle line:90%
You're digital information.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not
just information,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
then we are not really mushy--

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.340 align:middle line:90%
excuse me.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:28.150 align:middle line:84%
If we are just information, then
we're not really mushy humans

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.860 align:middle line:90%
anymore, are we?

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:90%
No, darling, you're not.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.180 align:middle line:84%
That opens up the
gateway to doing

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:90%
anything you want to this body.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.240 align:middle line:84%
To augment it, cut, copy, paste
it, do whatever you want to do,

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
because there is nothing
spiritual going on

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.860 align:middle line:90%
to begin with.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.150 align:middle line:90%
So where's AI coming from?

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:51.390 align:middle line:90%
Where is AI coming from?

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it might surprise you.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.690 align:middle line:84%
In 1979, James Lovelock,
who is a British chemist,

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.920 align:middle line:84%
was hired by NASA to assist
in its search for evidence

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.080 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial life.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Lovelock pondered
the intelligence

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that made Earth lifelike or
filled with life as opposed

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.180 align:middle line:90%
to a dead planet like Mars.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And he wondered what
was that something that

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:84%
transfigured Earth from a dead
planet to a living planet?

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
For him, that something
flashed across the TV screen

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
in July 1969, when Lovelock
experienced the overview

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
effect, the epiphanic
cognitive shift that

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.680 align:middle line:84%
came from seeing our planet
from space for the first time.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And he realized that
Earth is a living entity.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And he referred to that
living entity as Gaia.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Gaia, which was a
term that was actually

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:84%
coined by another biologist
named Lynn Margulis.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And it stands for the
totality of the material

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.500 align:middle line:90%
world and its creatures.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
What Lovelock proposed, and
this is the Gaia hypothesis,

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is that life and the Earth
are an interacting whole,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and the planet can be
seen as a single organism.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything on this planet
is one single organism.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And it says that not only is
Earth a single living organism,

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:17.100 align:middle line:84%
but it maintains conditions
necessary for its survival.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Earth has a plan,
according to Lovelock.

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.100 align:middle line:84%
All of the organic and
inorganic components,

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.870 align:middle line:84%
including my cell phone,
including any technology,

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
is technically integrated in a
single, living, self-regulating

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.480 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.160 align:middle line:90%
That is Gaia.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.650 align:middle line:84%
More, everything
that happens on Gaia

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:42.390 align:middle line:84%
is interconnected,
unified, and one, right?

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
Our spiritual goal, like the
pixels or particles of paint

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.470 align:middle line:84%
that make up a painting, is
to wake up and see the bigger

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.530 align:middle line:90%
picture of which we are a part.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Gaia in this incredible
intelligence,

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.780 align:middle line:84%
and the 2 trillion
galaxies that are out there

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.030 align:middle line:84%
in the known universe,
each with hundreds

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.070 align:middle line:90%
of billions of planets.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:84%
So Lovelock, and here's
Lovelock several years ago

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:10.200 align:middle line:84%
when he was 97 years old, he
launched a spiritual revolution

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.670 align:middle line:90%
with the Gaia hypothesis.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And it affirmed to us that
everything is connected,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.310 align:middle line:84%
that karma is actually
a valid concept,

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that any slight change
that I make in me

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:24.010 align:middle line:84%
results in a slight change
in everything around me.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And so no matter what
we do on our planet,

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.210 align:middle line:84%
we're all interconnected,
and we can't escape that

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:32.130 align:middle line:90%
as long as we're on this planet.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In Christian terms,
Gaia is an evolving

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:84%
ascending super
organism, and humans

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.080 align:middle line:90%
are co-evolving with her.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.280 align:middle line:84%
That's a very important premise
that Lovelock put forward.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And while this ignited a lot
of excitement in the new age

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.435 align:middle line:84%
circles, people began to
realize that there are particles

00:40:50.435 --> 00:40:51.810 align:middle line:84%
of light and there
are also waves

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of light at the same time,
it didn't really catch hold

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:90%
with the scientific community.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:41:00.000 align:middle line:84%
A little too mushy, a
little too spiritual.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So in 2006, Lovelock
now comes out

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:90%
and starts ringing alarm bells.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.810 align:middle line:90%
He's freaking out.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.200 align:middle line:84%
He's saying, humanity is
on the verge of extinction.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.402 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the creator of
the Gaia hypothesis,

00:41:13.402 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to predict
to you that by the end

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.170 align:middle line:84%
of the 21st century, 80%
of the world's population

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:23.420 align:middle line:84%
will be wiped out by a planetary
cataclysm, by climate change.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.010 align:middle line:84%
What would instigate
that climate change?

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Volcanoes?

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:28.160 align:middle line:90%
Droughts?

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.400 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.090 align:middle line:90%
Severe weather?

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:29.720 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Solar flares?

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.610 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Lovelock said, AI is
our number one threat,

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and Stephen Hawking
agreed with him.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.330 align:middle line:84%
AI will bring about
our extinction

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:84%
long before climate change will
impact us very dramatically.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And so why aren't we
warring against AI?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, because you
can't make trillions

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:57.440 align:middle line:90%
of dollars warring against AI.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So you say we're going
to save the planet.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.660 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to save the planet?

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.940 align:middle line:90%
With AI.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.240 align:middle line:84%
By turning ourselves
into machines.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm serious.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So in 2016, Lovelock,
again, then 97,

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.580 align:middle line:84%
said the more likely scenarios
of what's going to happen

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.570 align:middle line:84%
is that AI isn't going to
wipe out humans altogether.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to merge
with AI in order

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to survive and to save the
planet, which is exactly

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.120 align:middle line:90%
what they're telling us now.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.130 align:middle line:90%
So Lovelock is a true prophet.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.470 align:middle line:84%
His new work is
called Novacene, which

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:37.280 align:middle line:84%
is Lovelock's term for the new
epoch humanity has entered,

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.720 align:middle line:84%
an age that replaces
the Anthropocene.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.950 align:middle line:84%
We've gone past that, he
says, and the Novacene

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:84%
is when our technology moves
beyond our control, which

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
it already is.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Generating intelligence is
far greater and far faster

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:51.830 align:middle line:90%
than our own.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.560 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't see a violent
takeover anymore.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.677 align:middle line:84%
He's kind of mellowed
in that regard.

00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But rather, humans and
machines will work together

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.100 align:middle line:84%
to sustain Gaia as
a living planet.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.000 align:middle line:84%
So Lovelock basically
says in his own words,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.320 align:middle line:84%
AI was sent by Gaia to get
rid of us, because we've

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.490 align:middle line:90%
effed up the planet.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.850 align:middle line:90%
So here we are now in 2020.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.800 align:middle line:90%
We have-- actually, 2019.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk now seeks to
wrap Gaia, our planet,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:26.060 align:middle line:84%
in a blanket of 5G
radiation that's

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.360 align:middle line:84%
going to speed up the process
so that everyone on the planet

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.950 align:middle line:84%
can have high speed
internet access

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:34.010 align:middle line:84%
and download their
movies 100 times faster.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's already launched
his first 24 satellites.

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Those went up in
the summer of 2019.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And the payload, they say,
is the future of humanity

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.840 align:middle line:90%
and the future of the internet.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to have
20,000 of these things swarming

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.980 align:middle line:90%
You're upset about it.

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.270 align:middle line:90%
So are astronomers.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.340 align:middle line:84%
When they aim their
telescopes out to the stars,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:59.300 align:middle line:84%
this is what they see now, is
Musk's satellites whizzing by,

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.530 align:middle line:90%
streaking past them.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
hey man, you want

00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.570 align:middle line:84%
us to move to Mars because we're
already screwed up the planet.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, we won't even be able
to see Mars in a few years

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.900 align:middle line:84%
if you keep going
the way you're going.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.470 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely bizarre.

00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.560 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 billion of
us will be using 5G

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:84%
by 2025, which is
the next iteration

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.557 align:middle line:90%
of our telecommunications.

00:44:19.557 --> 00:44:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And you all have
responded, so I think

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:84%
you're up to speed
on the dangers of 5G.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.650 align:middle line:84%
It's potentially lethal
to all organic material

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.140 align:middle line:84%
on this planet,
yet we are wrapping

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the planet in a shield
of 5G radiation,

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:37.015 align:middle line:84%
in a sheet of 5G
radiation, that potentially

00:44:37.015 --> 00:44:39.230 align:middle line:90%
could kill everything.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Amazon is involved in it.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They want to launch satellites.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.880 align:middle line:84%
They haven't got
FCC approval yet,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.960 align:middle line:84%
but they want to put
another 3,300 satellites up.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And the people that love Earth
are saying, hey, wait a minute.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to launch those
3,000 satellites and rockets?

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea what that
will do to our atmosphere?

00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to launch 5G to
bring in AI to save the planet,

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:05.390 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
launch 5G with rockets

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.460 align:middle line:90%
that destroy our atmosphere?

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Who are you people, and
where are you coming from?

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And when are you
going to get around

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:14.143 align:middle line:84%
to telling the rest of us what
you're doing with this stuff?

00:45:14.143 --> 00:45:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't
even have to worry

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.300 align:middle line:90%
about all those satellites.

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.960 align:middle line:84%
You're just going
to have to start

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:84%
going through your neighborhood
in the next few years

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and start looking for things
that look like this antenna

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.350 align:middle line:84%
About every 10th home is going
to have this mega microwave

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:31.040 align:middle line:90%
oven spewing out 5G radiation.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And the thing of it is that its
millimeter length is so small

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.683 align:middle line:90%
that it can't go through trees.

00:45:36.683 --> 00:45:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So what are we going to
do with the trees that

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:90%
are in the way of 5G antennas?

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.140 align:middle line:90%
We're cutting them down.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:46.190 align:middle line:84%
We're cutting them
down so we can put up

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.060 align:middle line:84%
the infrastructure
of this new Earth,

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:53.210 align:middle line:84%
powering autonomous vehicles
and smart factories,

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.310 align:middle line:90%
remotely-controlled drones.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:90%
5G is about to--

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.490 align:middle line:90%
where's the heavenly music?

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:01.610 align:middle line:84%
5G is about to allow
every person on the planet

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:05.390 align:middle line:84%
to tap into data from billions
of sensors around the globe.

00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.430 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be friends.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.230 align:middle line:84%
Remember, that's what
the commercial said?

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the promise of on-demand
knowledge for anyone, anywhere,

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:90%
any time.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:16.040 align:middle line:84%
All you've got to
do is sacrifice

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.928 align:middle line:84%
your body and your planet,
and you can know everything.

00:46:20.928 --> 00:46:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We're connecting every
person on the planet

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:29.580 align:middle line:84%
with gigabit connection
speeds at minimal cost.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.920 align:middle line:84%
This is what Silicon
Valley is promising.

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.260 align:middle line:84%
As 5G electrifies a
world of trillions

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.010 align:middle line:84%
of sensors, everything from your
toothbrush, to your microwave,

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:41.880 align:middle line:84%
to your refrigerator, to your
car, to all your implants,

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.020 align:middle line:90%
are going to be online.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.455 align:middle line:84%
Everything's going
to be recorded.

00:46:45.455 --> 00:46:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It's going to have
a transmitter.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It's going to have a camera.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And everything is going
to be interconnected.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.750 align:middle line:84%
We're talking
hundreds of billions

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of objects, all emitting 5G
radiation on this planet.

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.770 align:middle line:84%
A whole new layer
of existence where

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:90%
intelligence is pervasive.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.450 align:middle line:84%
How about stupidity
is pervasive?

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
really trying to say,

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:13.100 align:middle line:84%
because this idea seems
completely anti-human,

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.910 align:middle line:90%
anti-life to me.

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
that's where I'm coming from.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:23.490 align:middle line:84%
AI is, in fact, an emerging
new layer of your or our brain,

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.590 align:middle line:90%
networked throughout the planet.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:30.000 align:middle line:84%
As predicted, or really
planned, by Ray Kurzweil,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Google's big brain engineer,
artificial intelligence

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.440 align:middle line:84%
will reach the human level
performance of this decade

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:90%
by 2030.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.550 align:middle line:84%
What's actually
happening, he says,

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is AI systems are
powering all of us.

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, some of us.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.700 align:middle line:90%
They're making us smarter.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They may not yet be inside
our bodies, but by the 2030s,

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:54.000 align:middle line:84%
we will connect our neocortex,
the part of our brain

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.630 align:middle line:84%
where we do our
thinking, to the cloud.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.850 align:middle line:90%
All of us, interconnected.

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And this is a way we're
going to save humanity.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.380 align:middle line:84%
As we conduct 5G,
we simultaneously

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:07.680 align:middle line:84%
will be growing a
new body, a new skin,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.190 align:middle line:84%
as that 2002 report
said, a new skin packed

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.280 align:middle line:84%
with AI devices that turn
us into super human beings,

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.010 align:middle line:90%
or what I call bio dots.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Part biology, part dots,
where dot stands for anything

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.495 align:middle line:90%
dot dumb.

00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:23.295 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me, dot com.

00:48:23.295 --> 00:48:26.400 align:middle line:90%


00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:29.850 align:middle line:84%
That bio dot means you're
going to be part biological,

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:31.590 align:middle line:90%
but mostly digital, OK?

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Because everything's going to
be in the cloud, and everything

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.460 align:middle line:90%
interconnected.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:39.900 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to help you
to navigate through this,

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.250 align:middle line:84%
so you can see what's
in front of you.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you decide you
want to go the AI route,

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll know what
you're getting into.

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:51.300 align:middle line:84%
A key element of this
is geospatial tracking.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the digerati put together
this clever little video

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.570 align:middle line:84%
that talks about
how wonderful it's

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be when your life
is under total surveillance,

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:06.210 align:middle line:84%
supervision, where
everything you do is watched.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.990 align:middle line:90%
The smart cities?

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.440 align:middle line:90%
This is what a smart city is.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This is the core of
the Green New Deal,

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.833 align:middle line:90%
save the planet, Green New Deal.

00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:14.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
build smart cities.

00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:90%
Everything is going to be smart.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.323 align:middle line:84%
It means everything is
going to have a chip in it.

00:49:18.323 --> 00:49:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything can be
radiating 5G radiation.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And worse than that
is 6g comes on,

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and we get the
world switched on,

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:28.260 align:middle line:84%
and we start to
transform ourselves.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:31.650 align:middle line:84%
5G will exist wherever
something is online.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's in your smartphone,
your smart watch, your car,

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:84%
your tablet, your refrigerator,
your toaster, your microwave

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:38.670 align:middle line:90%
oven, your toothbrush.

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere that we
go, it will be in it.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And what we're creating
is a new planet

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:48.030 align:middle line:84%
based on this, a denser
soup of electrosmog.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Prophecies have long spoken
of a new humanity and a change

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:90%
in the twinkling of an eye.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.010 align:middle line:90%
So this is the new humanity.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.610 align:middle line:84%
This is why I say this comes
out of Christianity, all right?

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.620 align:middle line:84%
This is where it starts,
this idea that we

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.400 align:middle line:84%
can perfect ourselves and go
back to our original status

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.170 align:middle line:90%
as beings of light.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.600 align:middle line:84%
John the Revelator spoke
of this very explicitly.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.280 align:middle line:84%
"I saw a new heaven
and a new Earth"

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is what Silicon
Valley thinks they're doing.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:15.600 align:middle line:84%
They're creating a new
heaven and a new Earth,

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.000 align:middle line:84%
and a new human to
live on this Earth.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And the old biological
human will not

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:23.040 align:middle line:84%
be able to survive
in this environment.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Didn't you get the memo?

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.380 align:middle line:84%
That email went out
simultaneously to all of us

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.210 align:middle line:84%
on the planet,
saying bubba, you're

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:35.170 align:middle line:84%
done, because AI and transhuman
is moving in, taking over.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.660 align:middle line:84%
We've got a new
planet, and we're

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:39.038 align:middle line:84%
starting to show it to
you in our advertising.

00:50:39.038 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
If you start paying
attention, you're

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.247 align:middle line:84%
going to see stuff
that looks like this.

00:50:42.247 --> 00:50:44.940 align:middle line:84%
Material cities with
this ethereal looking,

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:48.360 align:middle line:84%
beautiful looking,
smart city that's

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:84%
lethal to all organic
material if these 50,000

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.992 align:middle line:84%
medical doctors have even a clue
of what they're talking about.

00:50:55.992 --> 00:50:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So when you start
paying attention,

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.400 align:middle line:84%
you see this is
what they're doing.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Here's Verizon's CEO.

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:05.700 align:middle line:84%
"In the future," which is today,
because this is two years old,

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.303 align:middle line:84%
"everything is going to
be transformed by 5G.

00:51:08.303 --> 00:51:10.470 align:middle line:84%
We're going to experience
a technological shift that

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:12.510 align:middle line:84%
will transform
people, businesses,

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and society as a whole."

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And so what they're
creating is their term,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.170 align:middle line:84%
a virtually overlaid world,
a virtually overlaid world.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.090 align:middle line:90%
This world sucks.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It's time we woke up and
realize how old and crappy

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:29.880 align:middle line:84%
our body really is, and
how new and wonderful

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.160 align:middle line:84%
this new world is going
to be once we strap

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.940 align:middle line:84%
on our virtual reality goggles
and sacrifice our children

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.830 align:middle line:90%
to the altar of Silicon Valley.

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:41.800 align:middle line:84%
They'll see a new
heaven and a new Earth.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And they're so confident that
this AI genie or beast will

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.940 align:middle line:84%
clear everything in
its path to make way

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:53.070 align:middle line:84%
for a new digital era of smart
humans and a smart Earth.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:56.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything, including
humans, your dogs,

00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.330 align:middle line:84%
your cats, who want to keep up
will have a chip, an antenna,

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and instant access to the
green new brain anywhere

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:05.640 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:10.180 align:middle line:84%
All this because we need
AI to save the planet.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.240 align:middle line:90%
So this is where we're at.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.790 align:middle line:84%
We're taking our
children and turning them

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:18.290 align:middle line:84%
over to people who don't
believe you have a soul, who

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:21.350 align:middle line:84%
don't believe there's anything
spiritual about our planet,

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and that we're better
off becoming machines.

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what
they're envisioning

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:30.380 align:middle line:84%
is how we're going
to save the planet.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Not by planting
trillions of trees,

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:84%
but by planting hundreds of
billions of chips in everything

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and turning it into a smart
planet, a Jarva Shell.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:44.430 align:middle line:90%
So what's wrong with that?

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Besides everything
is wrong with that.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:50.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything is wrong with that.

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are not thinking about
doing this, or wondering

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.140 align:middle line:90%
if it could one day happen.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.650 align:middle line:84%
It's happening right
before our eyes.

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And just by way of
furthering the conversation,

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.970 align:middle line:84%
you can go to my website,
williamhenry.net,

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I've got 15 or so articles
on this very subject, all

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:16.230 align:middle line:84%
about AI, 5G, our
transformation, religious

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual implications
of AI, transhumanism, 5G.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.230 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult even
for me to keep up anymore.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.870 align:middle line:90%
I think of our children as--

00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:84%
one of most important
articles I read

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.840 align:middle line:90%
is "Pinocchio and Transhumans."

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Can transhumans ascend?

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Can transhumans ascend?

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.960 align:middle line:90%
No, they cannot.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.330 align:middle line:84%
No, they can not, according
to religious and spiritual

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:44.380 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.370 align:middle line:84%
But yet, we're insistent on
doing this neural link about AI

00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:51.100 align:middle line:90%
and Elon Musk, and then 5G.

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I want to get
to for this part of our talk

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:59.230 align:middle line:84%
is this article I wrote,
"Humanity's Baptism By Fire".

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Our species is now being
tested by a fire, a frequency,

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.960 align:middle line:84%
a vibration, 5G, and an alien
spirit or intelligence, AI.

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, before
the last ice age,

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:17.440 align:middle line:84%
humanity had a predator,
saber-toothed tigers,

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.610 align:middle line:90%
that type of thing.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.500 align:middle line:84%
For the past 10,000
years, we have not

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
had a predator on this
planet except ourselves.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.670 align:middle line:84%
We're willing to whack a
few hundred million of us

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:30.070 align:middle line:84%
in wars in the 20th
century, but we don't

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:32.440 align:middle line:90%
have an external predator.

00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Now we do.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Now we do, and it's testing us.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:39.960 align:middle line:84%
That predator is AI
that is coming after us.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I called our present
situation a baptism in fire

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.950 align:middle line:84%
because its implications are
profoundly transformative.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said several
times, they're prophesied.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Baptism by fire is a phrase
that means to learn something

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.540 align:middle line:90%
the hard way, difficult way.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.320 align:middle line:84%
It's used in the military,
or the police use it.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.350 align:middle line:84%
The first time someone puts on
a uniform, goes out into battle,

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.570 align:middle line:84%
or goes out on the streets
of LA as a policeman,

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.180 align:middle line:90%
that's their baptism in fire.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.030 align:middle line:84%
The phrase is not a
military phrase, though.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.030 align:middle line:90%
It comes from the Bible.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.550 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the
book of Matthew.

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:14.130 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist is talking,
and he says, "I baptize you

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:17.940 align:middle line:84%
with water for repentance, but
one who is more powerful than I

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.060 align:middle line:90%
is coming after me."

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And John is one of
the most empowered

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Essene mystic initiates
you could ever

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:27.840 align:middle line:84%
imagine walking the
face of the Earth,

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.850 align:middle line:84%
so he's talking about
a being who vastly

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:31.890 align:middle line:90%
supersedes his abilities.

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:37.860 align:middle line:84%
He says that "I am not worthy
to carry this being's sandals."

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes on to
say, "he will baptize you

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Holy Spirit and fire.

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.320 align:middle line:84%
His winnowing fork
is in his hand,

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and he will clean out
his threshing floor

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and will gather his wheat
into the storehouse.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:52.260 align:middle line:84%
But the chaff he will burn up
with inextinguishable fire."

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Now again, John is talking
about the Essene belief

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:56.970 align:middle line:84%
that they're calling
in this high celestial

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
being who's going
to teach humans

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:00.570 align:middle line:84%
how to become more
loving and how

00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:02.610 align:middle line:84%
to turn Earth into a
planet of righteousness

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.020 align:middle line:90%
and based on love.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And we widely believe that
the being he's talking about,

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.740 align:middle line:84%
of course, is Jesus,
and that he will lead us

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:14.160 align:middle line:84%
in this final battle between
the children of light, which

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is what the Essenes
call themselves,

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.750 align:middle line:84%
and the children of darkness,
who seek to eliminate

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.160 align:middle line:90%
the children of light.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's thought he's
talking about Jesus, but is he?

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Is he talking about the new H+?

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:30.610 align:middle line:84%
The new human that
they are developing

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:32.620 align:middle line:90%
in the labs in Silicon Valley?

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.860 align:middle line:84%
When 5G fires burn
within us, we will

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.930 align:middle line:84%
be able to augment our
brain to turn ourselves

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:40.000 align:middle line:84%
into super humans
that you won't even

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.660 align:middle line:84%
be able to hold the
sandals of this being.

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.970 align:middle line:90%
They'll have IQs of 10,000.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Einstein had an
IQ of around 200.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.882 align:middle line:84%
They will live for
hundreds of years.

00:56:51.882 --> 00:56:53.590 align:middle line:84%
They will have abilities
and intelligence

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.420 align:middle line:90%
beyond our comprehension.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:00.520 align:middle line:84%
This is where the Bible prophecy
tie-in becomes so important,

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.350 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
spiritual aspect of this.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you are a
spiritual being,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.880 align:middle line:84%
please don't tell me
Jesus never existed,

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.910 align:middle line:84%
or say you can't say the word
Jesus at a conference or things

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:11.770 align:middle line:84%
like that, because
this is so totally

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.060 align:middle line:90%
relevant to this conversation.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part of the
plan is eradicate anybody's

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.380 align:middle line:90%
belief in spirituality.

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Then they'll willingly turn
themselves and their children

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.090 align:middle line:90%
into machines.

00:57:22.090 --> 00:57:25.420 align:middle line:84%
The fire that separates
the wheat from the chaff,

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the human from
transhuman, is 5G.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Because the 5G people
will look at you and say,

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:35.110 align:middle line:84%
you're just an old
and crappy human.

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.120 align:middle line:90%
You're the old model.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.440 align:middle line:90%
You're the chaff.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:42.730 align:middle line:84%
You belong on the
fire of history.

00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:47.170 align:middle line:84%
You're like Neanderthal
to Homo sapiens.

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't belong on
this planet anymore,

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to choose
this fire and this frequency

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:55.960 align:middle line:84%
so high you won't even
want to be on this planet,

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:59.120 align:middle line:84%
because you won't
be able to stand it.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Transhumanists say
the exact same thing

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.650 align:middle line:84%
about 5G, this next
generation fire

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:05.720 align:middle line:90%
that powers all their devices.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.140 align:middle line:90%
No 5G, no transhumanism.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:12.660 align:middle line:90%
No 5G, no advancement of AI.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Where is the battleground?

00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.792 align:middle line:90%
It's 5G.

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.750 align:middle line:84%
That's why you've got
all these medical doctors

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:21.530 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, and
governments and cities,

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:25.190 align:middle line:90%
saying we need a moratorium.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We need time to figure out
what is really going on

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.310 align:middle line:84%
with this, because as
I'm suggesting to you,

00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:34.850 align:middle line:90%
the stakes are so high.

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly would go along
with the idea of a moratorium.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But the proponents, Google,
Apple, Samsung, Sony,

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:47.360 align:middle line:84%
all our favorite
companies, say, oh, but 5G

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.910 align:middle line:84%
will uplift and empower
this new techno AI world

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:54.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to create and
make trillions of dollars on.

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And you won't even recognize
this new human being

00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:00.460 align:middle line:90%
by the time we're done with it.

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The opponents of
5G say, yeah, it's

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:04.860 align:middle line:90%
a total assault on humanity.

00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:06.540 align:middle line:84%
The medical doctors
are saying, you'll

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.970 align:middle line:84%
get tinnitus, migraines,
fatigue, insomnia, brain tissue

00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.220 align:middle line:84%
damage, blood disorders,
difficulty thinking straight,

00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.270 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:16.965 align:middle line:84%
All the while being tracked
and surveilled 24/7, 365.

00:59:16.965 --> 00:59:19.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to sign up for it?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:19.800 align:middle line:90%
Hell no.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.470 align:middle line:84%
You would never go near
something like this.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And so the science
is on both sides,

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.250 align:middle line:84%
because again, you have
the Elon Musks saying,

00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:32.620 align:middle line:84%
oh, there's nothing to
worry about here, right?

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, the medical
people are saying,

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:37.020 align:middle line:84%
no, we actually are in
the middle of the greatest

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.780 align:middle line:90%
crisis in humanity.

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Higher frequency signals
have not been definitively

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.250 align:middle line:90%
proven to be harmful to health.

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:45.600 align:middle line:90%
That's their position.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:47.507 align:middle line:84%
They have not
definitively been proven.

00:59:47.507 --> 00:59:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember Elon Musk,
the other day, he said,

00:59:49.590 --> 00:59:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I've got this new super
truck I'm coming out with.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It's armor plated and you can't
even break the glass on it.

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So he has this guy
throw a wrench at it.

00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

00:59:59.070 --> 00:59:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.700 align:middle line:84%
So who wants to be the first to
put Elon Musk's neural implant

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.970 align:middle line:90%
in and flip the on switch?

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Oops, that's not
supposed to happen.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:11.220 align:middle line:84%
His exact response
was, oh my effing god.

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.480 align:middle line:90%
That's all he could say.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And we want to trust
the future of humanity

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.540 align:middle line:90%
to a great experiment like this?

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:22.657 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm that guy that was
here in 2012, eight years ago.

01:00:22.657 --> 01:00:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Actually 10 years
ago, because we were

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.160 align:middle line:90%
talking about this in 2010.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of those guys
saying big change is coming.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.567 align:middle line:90%
Get ready.

01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.650 align:middle line:84%
And people are like, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, that change
is now upon us.

01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:36.120 align:middle line:90%
That change is here.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly that
transformative moment

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.930 align:middle line:84%
that we were talking
about back then.

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We're counting down
to the singularity

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.280 align:middle line:84%
when the machines
that we're building

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
become smarter than us by a
little, or maybe by a lot.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Where will we be in 2030?

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.770 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to
decide if we're going

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to be walking in here
as organic beings,

01:00:57.690 --> 01:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
or having some mandated chip
with 5G fires burning in here.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.640 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm trying to again
just illustrate for you

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and illuminate here
is this is a plan.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
This is not something that is
just organically happening.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a plan.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very definitely a plan.

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And they have a progression
for this new human

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.910 align:middle line:84%
being coming online by 2020,
creating robotic copies

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:24.870 align:middle line:90%
of the human body.

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
2025, an avatar in which
the brain is transplanted

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
at the end of one's life.

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:34.380 align:middle line:84%
2035, an avatar with
an artificial brain.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Finally, and this is where
they ultimately want to go,

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:38.255 align:middle line:84%
they want to convince
you that you just

01:01:38.255 --> 01:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
need to drop your
physical body altogether.

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:45.217 align:middle line:84%
Copy and paste your contents
of your brain, which to them

01:01:45.217 --> 01:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
would equal your soul, but
they wouldn't call it a soul.

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
You're data, remember?

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:49.930 align:middle line:90%
You're just information.

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:54.540 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go live in a
new matrix on the new Earth

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to save the planet.

01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:00.458 align:middle line:84%
To them it will be you, because
you, by their definition,

01:02:00.458 --> 01:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
you are just the sum
of all your keystrokes

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
on Facebook, all the
pictures you put up there,

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:06.175 align:middle line:84%
all the phone calls
they've recorded.

01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:06.975 align:middle line:90%
That is you.

01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:07.990 align:middle line:90%
You are data.

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to understand that.

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:10.890 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't
agree with it, you

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:12.765 align:middle line:84%
have to understand it
from their perspective.

01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
You are not a mushy,
spiritual human being.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
You are Data that can
be cut, copy-pasted,

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
edited, and augmented and
popped into a new reality.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.030 align:middle line:84%
That is their form of
ascension, by the way.

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:26.430 align:middle line:84%
That is their form of
ascension, that you will go live

01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:28.770 align:middle line:84%
in this simulated
reality that for them

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.340 align:middle line:90%
is better than this one.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.327 align:middle line:84%
So corporations like ANA,
Japan National Airlines,

01:02:33.327 --> 01:02:35.160 align:middle line:84%
are saying oh, we've
got to save the planet.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
All these guilty bastards
out here flying around

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
on airplanes, we've
got to stop that.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to stop that?

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Oh, so ANA, the Japanese
national airline,

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.540 align:middle line:84%
created a robot that you can
put in your parents' house.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
So you sit at home, and when
you want to see mom and dad,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
you just fire up the iPad on
the robot in mom dad's home,

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.300 align:middle line:84%
and they talk to you
as if that's you.

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.730 align:middle line:90%
In fact, they call it new me.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%
They call that new me.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
New me.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.660 align:middle line:90%
ANA.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Watch this very carefully.

01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:06.210 align:middle line:90%

What's he touching?

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.030 align:middle line:90%
What's he touching?

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:26.740 align:middle line:84%
His implant, because none
of those scenes are real.

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:28.337 align:middle line:90%
It's all virtual.

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't want you traveling
around the planet anymore.

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
You can have an
implant where you

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.700 align:middle line:84%
can go anywhere, visit anyone,
virtually, in your own mind

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
without leaving your
cell, I mean your home.

The matrix.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.480 align:middle line:90%
And there's no doubt that AI--

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.258 align:middle line:84%
and that AI is
capable of generating

01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:48.300 align:middle line:90%
human-level intelligence.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.840 align:middle line:90%
This is now on its way.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:50.640 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And our children,
the next humans,

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
will be living with
an alien species.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what your
children and grandchildren

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
are being programmed for
now, is to live with robots,

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and to become a robot, to
aspire to be a robot, in fact.

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Their toys know their
faces, know their names,

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.600 align:middle line:84%
know their voices, are
recording everything.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Google and Amazon and Apple
record everything in your home

01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:19.020 align:middle line:84%
if you've got one
of their devices.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:21.900 align:middle line:84%
These devices,
Alexa and so forth,

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
are nothing but
surveillance machines.

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're replacement
parents now for kids.

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.080 align:middle line:84%
They read bedtime
stories to kids.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.130 align:middle line:90%
They answer them.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:30.738 align:middle line:84%
They give them
ultimate attention.

01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
What humans are
getting used to, what

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
these children are getting used
to, is hey, I love my robot.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
My robot loves me.

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're assigning human
qualities, emotions,

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.155 align:middle line:90%
and personalities to robots.

01:04:42.155 --> 01:04:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And as I said a
moment ago, we're

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
talking about them creating
an overlayed society.

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've got
digital sex robots

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
coming as well that
are going to make sure

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.550 align:middle line:84%
that that's the case, where
people are going to start

You remember her?

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Sophia the robot?

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
The first Android
to gain citizenship

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
in Saudi and the first robot
to grace Cosmo magazine, right?

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sophia is
being replaced too.

to communicate with humans.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And as I interact with
more and more people,

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I am constantly getting smarter.

01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I have become a
champion of innovation

for the United Nations
Development Program.

that now, don't you?

1962, when they first coined

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
the word cyborg.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the plan to
migrate into space

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and to take humans to the
next level of our evolution.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And 5G is the lifeblood
of all of these beings.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
No 5G, no AI.

>> Today's report calls for
the creation of a new unified

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
combatant command for space,
The United States Space Command.

01:07:56.570 --> 01:08:00.650 align:middle line:84%
This new command structure for
the physical domain of space,

01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:03.830 align:middle line:84%
led by a four-star flag officer,
will establish unified command

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and control for our
Space Force operations,

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
ensure integration
across the military,

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and develop the
space warfighting

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
doctrine tactics, techniques,
and procedures of the future.

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
The second step this
report calls for

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
is the creation of an elite
group of joint war fighters

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
specializing in the
domain of space,

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
who will form the backbone
of the nation's newest armed

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:29.657 align:middle line:90%
service, Space Operations Force.

01:08:29.657 --> 01:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:32.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like our Special
Operations Forces,

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.080 align:middle line:84%
a Space Operations Force will
draw men and women from across

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:40.550 align:middle line:84%
the military and will grow into
their own unique and cohesive

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.960 align:middle line:90%
community.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll support the
combatant commands

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:49.850 align:middle line:84%
by providing space expertise in
times of crisis and conflict.

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Third, this report
calls for the creation

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:55.262 align:middle line:84%
of a new joint organization,
the Space Development Agency,

01:08:55.262 --> 01:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that will ensure the men
and women of the Space Force

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:00.590 align:middle line:84%
have the cutting edge
warfighting capabilities

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.630 align:middle line:90%
that they need and deserve.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And now, we must do our part
to make bold breakthroughs,

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.600 align:middle line:84%
strengthen America's
industrial base,

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and deliver the cutting edge
warfighting capabilities

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
than our adversaries
could ever imagine.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.737 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what Americans will do.

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and to now live on
this planet as well.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't, again,
a conspiracy theory.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's 1918, and
Edison and Tesla are

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.860 align:middle line:84%

electrify the world,

And that's what the world
looks like tomorrow.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And the new age that
we are in right now

01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is going to look back
at where we came from,

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:09.243 align:middle line:84%

the inhumane age.

01:11:09.243 --> 01:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%

to scroll and swipe and just
have conversations and speak

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%

talking to anybody anymore.

My excitement, the reason why
I like artificial intelligence,

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Digital ascension.

01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Here's Facebook's plan.

01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:58.770 align:middle line:90%
This was from four years ago.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:14:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Watch closely.

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Puts on the VR.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, sis.

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Jack.

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:06.670 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now he went and lived
in the new reality.

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me show that
to you again, just

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.810 align:middle line:90%
so you make sure you get that.

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Because he is transformed
from a biological being

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.420 align:middle line:84%
into a pure digital
form that can now

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
exist in the new Earth, the
new overlaid reality, OK?

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:28.090 align:middle line:84%
One more time, so you clearly
see the transformation.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.290 align:middle line:90%
Oops, there he goes.

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.180 align:middle line:90%
No longer a biological entity.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
argument is that you

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
will love this new
simulated reality so much,

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:40.620 align:middle line:84%
because you can go be,
see, do anything you want.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.750 align:middle line:90%
You can live forever.

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
We'll copy and
paste the contents

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:47.397 align:middle line:84%
of your pitiful little brain
into your cartoon avatar

01:15:47.397 --> 01:15:48.230 align:middle line:90%
version of yourself.

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
This is why the 12-year-olds
are coming to my conferences,

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.848 align:middle line:84%
because they're
like, my teacher is

01:15:51.848 --> 01:15:54.250 align:middle line:84%
saying I've got to create
an avatar that lives online,

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to identify
with that person like it's me.

01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's not me.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Even a 12-year-old
knows that, right?

01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.967 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying, yeah, this is
the fundamental metaphysical

01:16:03.967 --> 01:16:05.633 align:middle line:84%
dilemma that we're
all facing right now,

01:16:05.633 --> 01:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
because we all have
data selves out there.

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I might live another 30
years on this planet,

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.360 align:middle line:84%
but my data self will
be on this planet

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.840 align:middle line:84%
as long as the flippin'
cloud is up there.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it going to be
creating karma for Me what

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:19.490 align:middle line:90%
if it goes and creates a crime?

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Is AI going to come and get my
physical body and imprison me?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.190 align:middle line:84%
These are all very important
metaphysical questions

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
that are right in front of
us, right now, that we're

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.370 align:middle line:90%
starting to deal with.

01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So that was four years ago
when Facebook introduced

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:32.360 align:middle line:90%
its primitive version of this.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:34.370 align:middle line:90%
This is-- they've scrapped that.

01:16:34.370 --> 01:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Now they've got
Facebook Horizon.

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, this
is from last year,

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.220 align:middle line:84%
so you know that they're
way advanced from what

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to show you.

01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:43.105 align:middle line:90%
So here's Facebook Horizon.

01:16:43.105 --> 01:16:45.230 align:middle line:84%
This is what they're trying
to entice your children

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.030 align:middle line:84%
into getting into
here, because Facebook

01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:48.950 align:middle line:84%
as you know it today is
very primitive, but here's

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:49.550 align:middle line:90%
where they want to go.

01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:50.350 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond our world,
there is another world.

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Another world.

01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's right
here on my face.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.460 align:middle line:90%
This is Horizon.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:04.495 align:middle line:84%
Think of me as your guide slash
self-appointed spokes-avatar

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:05.495 align:middle line:90%
here to show you around.

01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:06.295 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

01:17:06.295 --> 01:17:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Spokes-avatar?

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:08.110 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
I thought an avatar was
a high spiritual being.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.610 align:middle line:84%
No, now it's a cartoon
on Facebook Horizon

01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:16.370 align:middle line:84%
with no legs, which
you will design,

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:17.960 align:middle line:84%
which your children
and grandchildren

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
are being encouraged
to design right

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.220 align:middle line:84%
now to create for
themselves, and identify

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
with that world as
a preferable place

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.810 align:middle line:90%
to this old and crappy world.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
happening right now.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And that, ultimately,
is the plan.

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:32.300 align:middle line:90%
That really is the battleground.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
That is the focal point,
because again, as I say, no 5G.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
None of this happens without
the lifeblood, the fire,

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.620 align:middle line:84%
that empowers this
being, this new humanity

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.120 align:middle line:90%
and the new planet.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else matters
at this moment

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
other than resolving this
crisis and moving through it.

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> The speed that it's moving.

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the speed that it's
moving is how quickly we can

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.337 align:middle line:90%
make the change as well.

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:56.420 align:middle line:90%
You have to remember that.

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not totally
disempowered here.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
As this accelerates,
our spiritual powers

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:03.908 align:middle line:90%
are also accelerating as well.

01:18:03.908 --> 01:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember the warriors
I talked about,

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.658 align:middle line:84%
the girls in the yoga suits,
the hundreds of millions

01:18:07.658 --> 01:18:09.680 align:middle line:84%
of people that are doing
yoga and meditation?

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.450 align:middle line:84%
They are the counter
to this, and now they

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:13.520 align:middle line:84%
have to get plugged
in and understand

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
what is actually transpiring
and the important role that they

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
play in this.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:19.790 align:middle line:84%
I know you will
be looking at it.

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I hope you'll maybe visit my
website, williamhenry.net,

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
where I again am
routinely posting articles

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.510 align:middle line:90%
that will keep you posted.

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Get my book, "The
Skingularity is Near".

01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:31.152 align:middle line:84%
That is the best
hope right now, is

01:18:31.152 --> 01:18:32.360 align:middle line:90%
the spreading of information.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.540 align:middle line:90%
So God bless you all.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very, very much.

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.890 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:46.000 align:middle line:90%
