00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:06.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to see you guys.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.600 align:middle line:10%
So I want to talk
about a really out

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:10%
of the box topic
today, Starseeds.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of a story.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.740 align:middle line:90%
So it all started when I was--

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:84%
well let me just back
up and identify myself

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:90%
in case you don't know me.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.682 align:middle line:84%
I was a young attorney
on the fast track,

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:31.890 align:middle line:84%
going to accomplish great
corporate things I thought,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
when I woke up
with cancer at 25.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.940 align:middle line:90%
And I looked for solutions.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a gillion years ago.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought about things that
back then weren't known.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:84%
Well I stumbled on meditation,
journaling, energy healing.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I had an amazing remission
at the hands of a healer.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And flash forward,
I've spent the last,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, almost 40
years traveling the globe

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:84%
and learning, mastering
techniques from sages

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.270 align:middle line:90%
and shamans everywhere.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.545 align:middle line:84%
But along the way I've had
some very unusual experiences

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
that I want to talk
to you about today.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So let's go look at
Galileo for starters.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
1600, he invents the telescope.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And he discovers, contrary to
what was taught at the time,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that the Earth was not
flat, not the center

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of the universe like
everyone thought.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
He was really
maligned by the power

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.380 align:middle line:90%
of the time was the church.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.463 align:middle line:84%
And the church actually
put him under house arrest

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of his life
for this heretical thinking

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
But just flash forward 400 years
we have the Kepler Telescope,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:84%
which has proven to us, right,
that there are lots of stars,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.680 align:middle line:84%
lots of planets, so many
that we can't count them.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And like you saw in
the movie "Gravity",

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to picture
what it's like out there.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It's cold, right?

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're very alone,
floating around out there.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And then you think
you see something.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.789 align:middle line:84%
You think you see another,
an orb or a ship, OK?

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And guess who did in the
Mercury Capsule in 1963?

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:10%
Gordon Cooper, the reputable
scientific guy flying around

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:10%
out there who radioed back
to headquarters that he was

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:10%
definitely seeing something.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
He said extraterrestrial,
he used the word spacecraft.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And they picked it
up in Australia,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
a tracking station
picked up this craft.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But when he landed he
was instructed by NASA

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
not to talk about this, not to
be interviewed by the media.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And not long after, same thing
happened with Neil Armstrong.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Neil Armstrong, too,
in 1969 told NASA

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
that he was seeing a spacecraft.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh my god,
they're huge, they're huge,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.075 align:middle line:84%
and they're out
there on the edge.

00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And when he came down they
told him the same thing.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
We don't really want you to
talk about this publicly.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:90%
So how about Edgar Mitchell?

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm talking
about someone who

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
is memorable to a lot of
you, very revered, right?

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.270 align:middle line:10%
And he was so blown away
by what he saw out there

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:10%
that on the way back, on
his sixth time to the Moon,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:10%
he had an expansive awakening.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:84%
He said that he knew that
the molecules of his body

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and the molecules
of his spacecraft

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:90%
were all connected to the stars.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:90%
So pretty revolutionary talk.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
He started the Institute
of Noetic Sciences.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I was a young woman
that was the thing at the time,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.193 align:middle line:84%
we're there, we've
inherited what they started.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.735 align:middle line:84%
We really have here
a Conscious Life.

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
So here's what we
really are like, right?

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's Earth and all
the other planets.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that there's
so much going on out there

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.020 align:middle line:90%
that we can't even imagine.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
studied astronomy,

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:84%
I certainly never have,
to get a grasp of just how

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:90%
vast all of this is.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:90%
There's the Milky Way.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're a tiny, tiny,
tiny part of that, right?

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So our solar system moves
at 135 miles per second.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine, as we fly
through the sky in the Milky

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Way galaxy, there are over 200
billion stars in our galaxy.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
6 billion of these stars
have planetary systems

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
like ours, a lot of them
with water by the way.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And where there's water,
there can be life.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's 125 other
billion galaxies

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:90%
just in our visible universe.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what's
beyond our vision.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So how in the world
do we get the idea

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're the only
sentient beings, right?

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, I had never
thought about it honestly.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:90%
It never crossed my mind.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.570 align:middle line:84%
I was busy drinking in college
and didn't take this class, OK?

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:90%
So I knew, like, zip.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And then the first thing
that happened to me was I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
started to get this ringing
in my ears, not unpleasant.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
But you know, after a
few years I thought maybe

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I should have it checked.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Went to the hearing
doctor and he

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
said, man, you're
hearing's flawless.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.975 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you hear
just like a dog.

00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:90%
And I knew that.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.450 align:middle line:84%
My parents used to tease me
that I could hear beyond the--

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.380 align:middle line:90%
between the walls.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
And I could, I really could.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:90%
I still can.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact my hearing just
gets better every day.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer as much fun.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so acute, you
know, that the smallest sound

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:90%
like the planes here.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.032 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed
the planes nearby?

00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:57.240 align:middle line:90%
You guys have noticed, right?

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.220 align:middle line:90%
Me, too.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So the way I decided
after I'd had

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
this experience for a
few years of this ringing

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and being really
curious, I decided

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
to make a trip to
the Akashic records.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.772 align:middle line:84%
Now I do that for people,
for people like you.

00:06:14.772 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I take them to the
Akashic records.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So I myself went there
to check myself out

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and met with the record keeper.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said the problem
isn't in your ear.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:90%
You've got an antenna.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh shit.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:84%
You've got an antenna
above your ear

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that's picking up other
vibrations and other tones.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:90%
And it's meant to be there.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well that explains
why I like this kind of music

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:90%
so much, choral music.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
you know because I

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
find it just to be a kind
of out of body experience.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So about that time
clairvoyantly I

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
saw somebody that kind of
looked like him join us.

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:10%
And he had these
big headphone ears.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.203 align:middle line:10%
And I thought this was
pretty interesting.

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find a really
good representation of him.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you that
he actually is wider

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
as I see him than tall.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.700 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.490 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, huh.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Because when he appeared I had
this amazing visceral response

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
like I had just met a relative,
like somebody from my family

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:90%
had just come to see me.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was deep.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
It was profound.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
My whole body felt it, and I
was thinking at the same time,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:90%
no wonder I'm getting so wide.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm related to this guy!

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So he said to me, this
is where you're from.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:84%
This is Orion's Belt.
I'd never heard of it.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't familiar at all.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.960 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're a Starseed.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about Starseeds
and find out if you're one too.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I kind of
think that just about

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
everybody who comes to
Conscious Life Expo,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:90%
very, very strong chance is.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:90%
So I won't feel alone.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:84%
So Starseeds originate
from their soul.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Well let me back up.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.210 align:middle line:84%
A Starseed is an individual
like me and maybe like you

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
that's in a three dimensional
body, a human body.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But their soul came
from somewhere else.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:84%
It came from maybe another
planet, maybe a different star

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
system, a different galaxy,
maybe a parallel universe

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:90%
or another dimension.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching dimensions in
actually my next course.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:84%
It's really an
interesting topic.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:90%
There are many other dimensions.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So how do you know
if you're a Starseed?

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Well here are some
classic signs.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you have recurring
dreams or visions,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
ones that keep happening,
unique to you perhaps?

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember the future?

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
That is, does an event happen
for you before it happens,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:84%
so you're literally
remembering the future?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
had that experience?

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Aha, see quite a few.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Do you dream of flying?

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you have out of body
experiences, another classic?

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Does time seem flexible?

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it goes really fast.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it drags.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:90%
That's another sign.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.850 align:middle line:90%
How about synchronicities?

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Are you always seeing 11:11
on the clock or, you know,

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:90%
some other bizarre thing?

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
That's evidence of
being a Starseed.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:90%
Changing sleep patterns.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
You wake up every morning now at
3:00 and can't go back to sleep

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:90%
or you sleep all day.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.210 align:middle line:84%
You can't seem to
get enough sleep.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I've had all the above.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But probably the
most telling thing

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is you have this
strong desire to make

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
some change in the world.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.905 align:middle line:84%
You really want
things to change.

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So a Starseed is not
here so much to learn

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
as they are to be of service.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to ask yourself
if you feel like you're

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
really here to serve.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you know a lot of
people are here to learn.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you're here to serve,
to be of service, because most

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Starseeds I've
met and myself included,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.810 align:middle line:84%
we're here to help move
the people around us up

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.110 align:middle line:84%
to the next level of
their consciousness.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Because we're all
needing to move up.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are even working
with the Galactic Council.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll get to that in a second.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
But a seed, just
think about it, a seed

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
is something that's growing.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
may very well be.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.550 align:middle line:90%
You may be emerging.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:08.190 align:middle line:90%
You may be emerging.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
So I was so entranced
with what I was learning

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.240 align:middle line:90%
in the Akashic records.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I came back, and decided to
learn a little about Orion.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I'm from Orion
I want to know about it.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.861 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
how to spell it.

00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's played a
really remarkable role

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.680 align:middle line:90%
in our human history.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
You may know about this
tusk, this carved tusk that

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
was found in West Germany
in the 70s, I think 1979.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And on this tusk is an entire
carving of the Orion stars,

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:90%
entire carving.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.930 align:middle line:84%
This thing is 35,000 years old
according to anthropologists.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And then I've been
to all these places,

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:84%
which I found in retrospect
to be somewhat telling.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.730 align:middle line:90%
So I've been to Mexico.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've seen these
amazing structures in Mexico,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.030 align:middle line:84%
these two pyramids
that point directly

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to the two main stars
of the Orion belt.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:10%
Likewise I've been to
the Hopi Territory.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.260 align:middle line:10%
How many people have been there
and have seen these mesas?

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
These mesas, they
didn't grow there.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:20.940 align:middle line:90%
They were made.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And they point directly to
the entire Orion collection

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:90%
of stars.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:10%
And then of course there's Giza.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
How many people have been there?

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a lot of people.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
So there, if you're looking
at the pyramids from above,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:84%
they're perfectly aligned
with the Orion Belt.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And they're also
at the dead center

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:10%
of the center of the Earth which
is a very impressive thing.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.480 align:middle line:10%
Because you'd have to have a
hugely advanced consciousness

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:10%
to know where that is.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So again, you know, it's hard
to say how old those are.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So talking about the Egyptians,
their God was Osiris.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And they were positive that
Osiris had come from the stars

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and was going to come back here.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's a redemption tale.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:84%
How many other religions
and bodies of thought

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.480 align:middle line:90%
share that same belief?

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:10%
Well there's Kalki for
the Hindus coming back.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:10%
The Hindus believe
Kalki's coming back.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
Maitreya for the Buddhas.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:10%
It's believed that
Maitreya is coming back

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:10%
by people who follow Buddhism.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:10%
And then the Messiah
for the Jews.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:10%
The Redeemer for
the world of Islam.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.770 align:middle line:10%
And the second coming of
Christ for Christians.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.725 align:middle line:84%
Notice the similarity
between each one

00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:51.850 align:middle line:90%
of these bodies of thought.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
This is pretty incredible
that every single one

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:84%
of these huge major
cultures believes

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that their redeemer
came from up there,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
think stars, came here
to solve problems,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
was with them for a while, went
back, but is going to return.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
It's just too uncanny, right?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:84%
So I was so excited by
everything I was learning.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I went back.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the Akashic
records for visit number two.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And there I was shown
a movie this time.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So my Orion guide, the guy
that's wider than he is tall,

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:90%
comes.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And he shows me, starts
to play this movie for me.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm seeing it in
my clairvoyant vision.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:90%
And first he shows me--

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the movie starts, and it's me
as an infant or perhaps just the

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:90%
thought of an infant.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's preconception.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And he shows me this picture
of this blue planet and says,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:90%
that's Earth.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like us up here
where we don't have any war.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't have any dissension.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
pain or sickness.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.300 align:middle line:84%
These people down there,
they're really troubled.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And how about going
there to help out?

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we'd like you to
go to the middle of the United

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, uh oh.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And he pointed, he said
halfway, midway to Canada,

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.550 align:middle line:84%
midway into Mexico,
but mainly main focus

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:90%
would be the center of the US.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.453 align:middle line:84%
And God love them,
my Orion guides.

00:15:25.453 --> 00:15:26.995 align:middle line:84%
I still haven't
moved to the Midwest.

00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who
love it, I honor that.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty sold on
this California weather.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.100 align:middle line:90%
But then he showed me Lemuria.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about where this
information about the stars

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:10%
and our history
of star ancestry,

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.218 align:middle line:10%
is there any validity to it.

00:15:55.218 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean I'm a lawyer
for christ sake, right?

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm looking for some
left brain stuff here.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So I did quite a bit
of research on this.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And Lemuria, there is a
lot of evidence for it

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
in 18th century
scientific literature.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:84%
You have to go all the way
back to there to find it.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you read that
literature you'll

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.430 align:middle line:84%
find that there
was a lot of talk

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:84%
at the time about
an island that sunk

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that had outstanding
people that were balanced

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
in higher consciousness.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And they relied almost
exclusively on--

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
they came from the
Pleiades originally.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And they were really
into crystals.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And they stored their whole
history in the crystal,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:84%
because crystals, rock, OK
can actually store memory

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.730 align:middle line:90%
so they stored it all.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And when they had a prescient
knowing that their island was

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
going to end and was going to go
down, they were aware of that.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they stored all their
crystals very carefully.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:10%
Now the other body
of thought of course

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.270 align:middle line:10%
is Atlantis, also
well researched,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.450 align:middle line:10%
quite a bit more
documentation on Atlantis.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:10%
You can read about it in
Plato and Thomas Moore

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.690 align:middle line:10%
and other writers of the time,
18th, 19th century writers.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:10%
They talk quite a bit about
the island of Atlantis.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Also mid-continent
thing, but this time

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Now the Atlanteans,
they were very different

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:90%
from the Lemurians.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The Lemurians were
peace loving, really

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.140 align:middle line:90%
into community kind of people.

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
The Atlanteans however were
interested in high tech.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
That's typical
Lemurian kind of thing.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.920 align:middle line:84%
They want to
connect with nature.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:90%
That's typical Atlantean.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:84%
They're really into metal
and stone and technology.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Well we know what
happened to them, right?

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Everybody here knows.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:90%
They had a lot of wars.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.260 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't get along.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Their planet sank.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Their entire race and
culture was extinguished.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of crystals
that the Atlanteans

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.330 align:middle line:90%
inherited from the Lemurians.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what they used.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Look how gigantic they are.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So the Atlanteans were
supposed to guard the people

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:90%
by running the crystals safely.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:10%
And instead they got on a
power trip of their own,

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:10%
and they started using the
crystals to the disadvantage

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:10%
of their own people.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Again their island went down.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
So after all the
wars that created

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the collapse of Atlantis, there
became a Galactic Federation

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.667 align:middle line:90%
of Light.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.930 align:middle line:10%
So this is a big federation.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:10%
It's run by people who are
light beings like this one.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a real thing.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They are literally running many
universes including our own.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And they're waiting for us
to like come up to speed.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
So our job here, all of us, is
to help increase consciousness.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that is
individually, one at a time,

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
Each of us, first of all, we
work on our own consciousness.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we have to help our
neighbor, help our neighbor.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So this was all very
fascinating to me, this history.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I went back
to the records.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
But before I go to the records
I want to lead you just

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:90%
on a short meditation.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to start to instill
the DNA opening for you

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.950 align:middle line:90%
So you want to close your eyes.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.366 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if you've got stuff in your
lap, just put it on the floor.

00:19:54.366 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So everybody kick back
and enjoy for a minute.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.380 align:middle line:90%
So focus your heart--

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.558 align:middle line:84%
focus your thoughts on
your heart chakra right

00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:03.725 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your chest.

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Just drop right into your heart.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.585 align:middle line:90%
Feel it opening and widening.

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.530 align:middle line:90%
And opening and widening.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
Just feel it expanding
and expanding.

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.975 align:middle line:84%
And now move your attention up
slightly to your thymus gland.

00:20:31.975 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%
It's right at your breastbone.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You can tap on it if you
like if it helps you find it.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You want it to enlarge.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the seed of your
spiritual development

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:90%
and your immune system.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But right now we're looking
for spiritual development.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So take your attention there
and then a little bit higher.

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the throat chakra.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And from there we're going
to go to the third eye.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Just let it open and widen.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:19.555 align:middle line:84%
And now to the pituitary gland
that's not far behind it.

00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:21.305 align:middle line:84%
It's really behind the
bridge of the nose.

00:21:21.305 --> 00:21:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And intending for it
to thrive and be open.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then to your pineal gland
slightly behind the pituitary

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit above.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Intending for it to
thrive and be open.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And now to the top of your
head, crown chakra, open.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Feel all that golden
light just coming in.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And now using your
intentionality

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
look for just above your
head a ball of white light.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And pull it down
using your intention,

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:15.820 align:middle line:84%
down through your crown,
down through your third eye,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and your throat, and
down into your heart.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:34.606 align:middle line:84%
And just picture for a moment
a star ancestor, yours.

00:22:34.606 --> 00:22:36.820 align:middle line:84%
It can look like
anything you wish.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:44.190 align:middle line:90%
Meeting you, coming to meet you.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And take a journey with
me and your star ancestor.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:90%
And let's all head over to Peru.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:90%
We'll go over and down.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.810 align:middle line:90%
And now we're in Peru.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.705 align:middle line:84%
You're right under my
energetic umbrella.

00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to Lake Titicaca,
right on the edge of the lake.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And now we cease being
three dimensional

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
and become five dimensional so
we can go right in the water.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:38.495 align:middle line:84%
And as we go into the water we
come upon an underwater city.

00:23:38.495 --> 00:23:41.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful soft water
encompassing us,

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:50.000 align:middle line:84%
we're now in the home
of the illuminated ones.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Just feel how safe you are here.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where we find the
Brotherhood of the Seven Rays.

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Just know by your intentionality
you're here with me

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.640 align:middle line:90%
in this fifth dimensional city.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.171 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:24:15.171 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And down there we
find the golden disk,

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:27.480 align:middle line:90%
golden disk of Meru.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.770 align:middle line:90%
So he brought it here.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The collapse of
Lemuria and Atlantis.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:90%
He stored it here for safety.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
He stored it here
along with the scrolls.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:84%
So the disk and the
scrolls together

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.460 align:middle line:84%
can generate your
fifth dimensional

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:90%
being that you really are.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
You're actually much more
possibly dimensional than that.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:90%
But we'll start with fifth.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.210 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And can empower
your intentionality.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So just drop in
and feel this disk.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It has all of the
different metals, metals

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.495 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even know about
here on Earth, beyond gold, way

00:25:18.495 --> 00:25:19.295 align:middle line:90%
beyond gold.

00:25:19.295 --> 00:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And Lake Titicaca and this
underwater city, centuries

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:84%
later the Incas
built Machu Picchu.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:84%
There they could sense
the power of the lake

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:90%
and what was underwater.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.955 align:middle line:84%
And they built this using
light energy, not human energy.

00:25:49.955 --> 00:25:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:59.220 align:middle line:10%
So really feel that
these so-called myths

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:10%
of the indigenous,
they're not myth.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:90%
They're the real truth.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.820 align:middle line:84%
What you're taught, what
I was taught in school,

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:90%
is not the real truth.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:10%
The indigenous have
kept this truth for us.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:22.750 align:middle line:10%
So we do have continuous
visitation from the stars.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:10%
Just as they knew, we
too, we can learn this.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:10%
We can feel this.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:10%
We can become conscious of it.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.050 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
all open our eyes.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.860 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.560 align:middle line:84%
All this is pretty
trippy stuff for me.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm still practicing law at
this point, and I'm like,

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.490 align:middle line:90%
you're kidding.

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to make another
visit to the Akashic records.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And this time I went back up.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:84%
And the same guide from
the records met with me.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.322 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want you
to go sit in this library.

00:27:02.322 --> 00:27:03.405 align:middle line:90%
So I went to this library.

00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
It had this dome roof,
this dome ceiling.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there, and all
of a sudden the dome comes off

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm flying through
the stratosphere

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:18.300 align:middle line:84%
like I've got a jet pack on,
just like you can imagine,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.100 align:middle line:84%
just like you've seen
in the movies, right?

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Except it felt very real.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm flying past stars.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing was
really pretty exciting.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I come upon some robots,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:31.800 align:middle line:90%
robot beings.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:90%
And they had these intense eyes.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
you're capable of doing

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:90%
what we do with our eyes.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're doing when
you're doing initiations.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, that
made sense to me.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.130 align:middle line:90%
That made sense to me.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:57.615 align:middle line:84%
And they took me, these robots
took me to this amazing city.

00:27:57.615 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty incredible.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:84%
The buildings were really
tall, but they were all

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.350 align:middle line:84%
connected like a train which
I'd never seen before, not here.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And I went all the way
down to the ground floor.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I'm being
jet packed around.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:10%
I went down to the ground
floor, and I could see

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:12.970 align:middle line:10%
how they were all connected.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.595 align:middle line:84%
And I could see a
lot of people walking

00:28:14.595 --> 00:28:17.622 align:middle line:90%
on powered walkways that were--

00:28:17.622 --> 00:28:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I use the word people
loosely, but tons of beings

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:90%
walking on these walkways.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And they took me into a
room called a librarium

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.610 align:middle line:84%
where in this room you
were healed with sound.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that make sense?

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It makes perfect
sense to me, right?

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.630 align:middle line:90%
That sound heals.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And that you'd go in there
to get retuned and just

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.410 align:middle line:90%
get like reset, get corrected.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So they said, Deborah,
you're doing this already.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:90%
You're like a tuning fork.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you
incarnated for was

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:90%
to come here to do this.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.063 align:middle line:84%
So this really reminded
me of the kind of beings

00:29:00.063 --> 00:29:01.480 align:middle line:84%
that I remember
seeing down there.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd show you this
image because this is not

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
really human, very
interesting looking for sure.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:10%
And then they showed me
that there were these three

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:25.410 align:middle line:10%
beings that have the ability
to form a view with their eyes

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and that they sent this beam to
me in the form of a triangle.

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:36.180 align:middle line:10%
And that then I shoot
this out of my eyes.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you're the right
person for me to hit,

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:10%
it lights you up, and then
you have light to send.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Now from all my work since I've
initiated thousands and maybe

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
tens of thousands of
people, I don't pick you.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:53.190 align:middle line:90%
You pick me.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:90%
You have to be ready.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:90%
I can't make it happen for you.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
You have to bring
me the raw material.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I can see it over your head.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I see a little light bulb up
there or a candle or a flame.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So then they showed
me this image.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the Earth with
an exoskeleton over it.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:15.390 align:middle line:10%
So they said the whole idea
is to activate these nodes.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just
on Earth, they're

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:20.880 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire
multi-universes.

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And Earth evidently is like one
of the last to come on board.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:84%
We're like the slowest one
around, which I don't doubt.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to get
us to activate our nodes so

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.080 align:middle line:84%
that Earth will have
ears and a voice

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:84%
and be able to be heard
in the entire universe.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.775 align:middle line:84%
So we're lagging a
little bit behind.

00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But that's why
you're here today.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.700 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're
here this weekend

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.220 align:middle line:90%
is to spur this whole thing on.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So I want to talk about
Sirius for a minute, the star,

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.205 align:middle line:84%
in case some of
you are from there.

00:31:00.205 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's the
hottest one of the hottest

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.162 align:middle line:90%
stars in the universe.

00:31:03.162 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And the Dogon, do you
remember the Dogon?

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.340 align:middle line:90%
You guys know about them?

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
A tribe from Mali
in West Africa.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And they have known
their entire time

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.380 align:middle line:84%
that they came
from a race called

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the Nomos that came from a
star system, from Sirius.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have incredible
gifts if you read about them.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:26.872 align:middle line:90%
They're still around.

00:31:26.872 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
They're pretty
amazing, and they do

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.780 align:middle line:84%
healing which I've seen that
is not like anything you'll

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:90%
find here on Earth.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:90%
It's clearly other worldly.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very star like.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:43.280 align:middle line:10%
And the Dogons
primitive culture knew

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:48.360 align:middle line:10%
long before we discovered in
1970 that Saturn for example,

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.670 align:middle line:10%
had rings.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.980 align:middle line:84%
They know that for
thousands of years.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they say that the
Nomos taught them so long ago.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want to do another
little meditation with you.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
You can leave your
eyes open if you want.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:90%
So here is your space vehicle.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Here is your personal
space vehicle, OK?

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.430 align:middle line:84%
It's this golden,
beautiful golden bubble.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.185 align:middle line:84%
I want you to feel
very safe in it.

00:32:13.185 --> 00:32:14.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
just a little trip.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:84%
As we launch out and
we get far enough out,

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.910 align:middle line:90%
right, we see the Milky Way.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:90%
That's how far out we are.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.990 align:middle line:90%
We can actually see it.

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:34.450 align:middle line:10%
And we feel this huge sense
of peace and love, really

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.860 align:middle line:10%
a huge sense, right?

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.730 align:middle line:10%
Because you're sensing
like the astronauts,

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.130 align:middle line:10%
you're sensing how
huge the universe is

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:10%
and how much you're
a part of it.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:90%
You are so much a part of it.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And your star ancestor
comes back to you.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember the guy you met in the
meditation a minute ago, guy

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:90%
or a gal or without gender.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And takes you to a
place and says to you,

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:90%
this is where you're from.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is a different
color than Earth.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the atmosphere
is a different color.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:90%
But you resonate with it.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.575 align:middle line:90%
To you it feels like home.

00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:21.710 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It may feel like the home,
the real home you come from.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And you see beings there
that you think nothing

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.940 align:middle line:90%
like you've ever seen before.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But they could very well
be part of your DNA.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And your star ancestor hands you
a perfect sphere of a crystal.

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect sphere.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Boy, you feel it in your hand.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:55.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't believe how it feels.

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:90%
So powerful.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And he or she tells
you that this is you.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.630 align:middle line:90%
This is your history.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:90%
This crystal has memory in it.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:84%
It tells you where
you're really from.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.190 align:middle line:90%
You have a star ancestor.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:14.060 align:middle line:90%
You have some history here.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And the star beings
of the Aquarian age

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.360 align:middle line:90%
are speaking to you.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.339 align:middle line:84%
They're upgrading your
genetic code right now,

00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:24.464 align:middle line:90%
right where you're sitting.

00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:27.676 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.676 --> 00:34:29.889 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
the Tibetan monks

00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that designed this
sacred geometry that

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:90%
impacts you so much.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:43.405 align:middle line:84%
They were so gifted, clearly
had star ancestry in their DNA.

00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And this crystal
that you're holding,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:50.219 align:middle line:90%
it acts as a transformer.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:52.929 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.800 align:middle line:84%
It enhances your brain
function, your cellular function

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:90%
of your body.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And it generates a force
field around itself

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and around you, a
force field that

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:84%
allows you to fire up
your intentionality,

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.485 align:middle line:90%
really make things happen.

00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Great, you can
open your eyes now.

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're like
me and you're not--

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.910 align:middle line:84%
I was not conscious of
this history of mine.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.560 align:middle line:90%
I really wasn't.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I always felt different,
weird kind of,

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.833 align:middle line:84%
and had had a lot of
weird experiences.

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell
you about one of them

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that way precedes my visit
to the Akashic records.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.160 align:middle line:84%
So it was about the time
I wrote my first book

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
"Truth Heals" which
was a tell all memoir

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.120 align:middle line:84%
about my dearly beloved
dad with whom I'd

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.005 align:middle line:90%
had a long history of incest.

00:35:55.005 --> 00:35:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It was very destructive
of course and very hard.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And while I was writing it
which was a long time ago,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:84%
long before it was
published I was writing it,

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I decided the thing
to do was to call

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.680 align:middle line:90%
my mother who I was afraid of.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.875 align:middle line:90%
And so I called her.

00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it in person.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I had to do it on the phone.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I was very disempowered.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was so disempowered I
was terrified of many things,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.520 align:middle line:84%
including public speaking, which
is kind of entertaining now.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.090 align:middle line:90%
But I really was.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
hard being a lawyer

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:middle line:90%
being so afraid to speak.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So it was kind of
a bummer at work.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.052 align:middle line:90%


00:36:36.052 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:90%
So anyway I called her.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I remember I was shaking.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, I want to talk

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:44.300 align:middle line:90%
to you about the deal with Dad.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:90%
She knew what I meant.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, oh, you know,
let's not talk about it.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all in the past.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Just forget about it.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.850 align:middle line:84%
But somehow just talking
to her really took the top

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:90%
of the building off for me.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And I was suddenly
super empowered.

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And about a week later we moved
to this amazing horse ranch.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.400 align:middle line:90%
It was just serendipitous.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.430 align:middle line:84%
We're way out in the country,
40 acres, lots of horses,

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.860 align:middle line:90%
very, very rural.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And we've only been
there a couple of nights

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:22.160 align:middle line:84%
and I wake up at midnight
and I hear this directive

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.210 align:middle line:90%
that says go outside.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.042 align:middle line:84%
So I go outside by myself,
and I remember the voice

00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:29.125 align:middle line:90%
said, put the cat indoors.

00:37:29.125 --> 00:37:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So I picked the cat up,
put the cat indoors.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And the voice, you know,
I'm hearing a voice.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.940 align:middle line:84%
And the voice says walk to the
top of the the highest hill.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.655 align:middle line:84%
So I see a hill, and I haven't
walked this property yet.

00:37:40.655 --> 00:37:42.207 align:middle line:90%
It's new, and so I go and--

00:37:42.207 --> 00:37:43.040 align:middle line:90%
there's a full moon.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And so I go up to
the top of the hill.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And guess what's up there?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:90%
There's a mandala.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.830 align:middle line:90%
I was really surprised.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm told to lay down
or sit down in this mandala

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:84%
and look up at a
particular group of stars.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.250 align:middle line:10%
So I do.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.170 align:middle line:10%
Well I don't realize it's Orion.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.500 align:middle line:10%
Again, remember I don't
know zip about the heavens.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.170 align:middle line:90%
So anyway I do what I'm told.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.945 align:middle line:84%
And I do it every night
really for a whole summer.

00:38:08.945 --> 00:38:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was a pretty
interesting experience.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.090 align:middle line:84%
It was also very
tiring during the day

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.290 align:middle line:90%
because I was awake all night.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:19.340 align:middle line:84%
But there's the
stars I'm focused on.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know
just after a few nights,

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.410 align:middle line:84%
half a dozen nights maybe, I
start to hear these sounds.

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And I feel motivated to
reproduce them, to mimic them.

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So there I am out there,
laying on the ground.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad it's rural so that
the people in the white coats

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:84%
don't come, you know,
put me in the wagon

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:43.490 align:middle line:90%
and take me into town.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm mimicking these sounds.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Well flash forward
after the summer I

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.760 align:middle line:90%
go to see a chiropractor.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And I'm laying on this table.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the guy.

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It's my very first visit.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
I know I'm supposed

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.390 align:middle line:90%
to make these sounds at him.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.018 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what the heck.

00:39:04.018 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
So there I am waving my
arms in the air and going.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.040 align:middle line:90%
[QUIET SCREAMING]

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And he's transfixed like this.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Trust me, I never went back.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
After that experience I
was like, how humiliating.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:23.350 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that I
had transformed him.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.850 align:middle line:90%
I realized that.

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And within a week I
held my first workshop,

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.060 align:middle line:84%
and I started doing a few people
at a time and then a few more.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:36.555 align:middle line:84%
And then today on a good
day I can do a whole room.

00:39:36.555 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on what
you bring me, though.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.310 align:middle line:84%
You've got to bring me
the high consciousness.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:43.990 align:middle line:90%
But certainly person by person.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So ask yourself, where
are you in all of this?

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you have star ancestry?

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.797 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you're
here this weekend,

00:39:56.797 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and for those of you
who are live streaming,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think
you're watching this

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.850 align:middle line:84%
unless you've got some
connection really to the stars.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.395 align:middle line:90%
I think we do.

00:40:06.395 --> 00:40:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I think we really do.

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Anybody who wants
change, anybody

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.330 align:middle line:84%
who feels a little different,
I think this is us.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want this
kind of change.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you want to-- who
knows what your task is.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's to work on
climate change or the ocean.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your task is
to be an activist

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:34.040 align:middle line:84%
for marginalized groups, women,
children, gays, ethnicities

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.960 align:middle line:84%
that are trampled on,
or pets, the wildlife.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, just choose your
passion, whatever it may be.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure you have
a special task here.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.713 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's the arts.

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're meant to change
the world through music

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.125 align:middle line:90%
or writing a book or painting.

00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:56.803 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.803 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, which way
are you going to go?

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to go
this way or that way?

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I actually had what I
thought was just such

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.435 align:middle line:90%
a telling dream one time.

00:41:04.435 --> 00:41:05.310 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I literally saw that
this way that way sign.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:08.628 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
can't my unconscious

00:41:08.628 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:90%
do better than that?

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it seemed
kind of prosaic.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.830 align:middle line:90%
But I actually saw this.

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:19.710 align:middle line:84%
So go deeply in
your heart right now

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and really think about
how can you affect change.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you're not happy
with the world the way it is.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm positive, right?

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But we take that
happiness that we have,

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:84%
that core you have in
you, and you spread it.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:90%
You generate it.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You send it out.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You send it out.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So I love this quote
from Muriel Strode.

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.560 align:middle line:90%
She was an early 1900s poet.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:10%
And she says, "I will not
follow where the path may lead,

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.610 align:middle line:10%
I will go where
there is no path,

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.340 align:middle line:10%
and I will leave a trail."

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.015 align:middle line:10%
That's what I want you to do.

00:41:55.015 --> 00:41:56.640 align:middle line:10%
That's what I'm trying
to do, you know?

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.780 align:middle line:10%
Join me.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Join me in making
your own trail.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Hey, let's talk about a few
people who I'm pretty sure

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:04.920 align:middle line:90%
are Starseeds.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.702 align:middle line:84%
You probably recognize
Nikola Tesla, right?

00:42:07.702 --> 00:42:08.910 align:middle line:90%
You know what he always said?

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:11.820 align:middle line:84%
He said he was from Venus,
and he wasn't ashamed to.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.215 align:middle line:90%
He was ahead of me.

00:42:14.215 --> 00:42:15.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
time I've come public

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.070 align:middle line:84%
with this little
bit of information.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But you know, a futurist, an
amazing engineer and inventor.

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:26.910 align:middle line:90%
What about Carl Sagan?

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Really, you know, he was big
on finding extraterrestrials,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote the
book "Contact" which

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:84%
became the movie "Contact"
which I assume you have seen.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And let's not forget
about Steve Jobs.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Let's give him credit because
we all have to be connected.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.780 align:middle line:90%
We have to be together in this.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And he's given us a real step
up with his forward thinking.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure this guy's a Starseed.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's me, young.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I had trouble.

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the
Akashic records

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.390 align:middle line:84%
because I had a lot of
trouble with some of the rules

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:01.290 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I kept falling.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't quite wrap my head
around the rules of gravity.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:09.227 align:middle line:84%
And I also didn't
believe in sleep.

00:43:09.227 --> 00:43:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a
huge waste of time.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of got over
that after a while.

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But here are the grids
that I saw on my last visit

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.130 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic records.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.230 align:middle line:84%
They were still
trying to show me

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
what it's really like, that
it's a very grid like universe.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the Galactic
Council as best

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I can represent it for you
from the clairvoyant vision I

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.280 align:middle line:90%
had of it.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.720 align:middle line:84%
A real council of real beings,
none of whom looked human.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But really running
the universes.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The universes, it's an
amazing, amazing concept.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.690 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to Genesis,
and I did a lot of Bible study

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:00.560 align:middle line:84%
for one of the major schools
of healing that I studied in

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:04.400 align:middle line:84%
for 10 years, I had not
really encountered much Bible

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.990 align:middle line:90%
before that.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And you know, in Genesis it says
we are created in their image.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.020 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.684 align:middle line:90%
Their.

00:44:15.684 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Their image.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Pretty interesting, huh?

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And then look at
the five root races.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:84%
DNA, it's different,
right, in each,

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:28.790 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different place,
coming from a different planet,

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:84%
coming from a different
dimension perhaps.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.560 align:middle line:90%
So why do we have these--

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're
so different now.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.770 align:middle line:90%
We're so polarized.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:41.560 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
opposition, and you know,

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't see your view.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You can't see my view.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.000 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty bad.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get any
worse than it got here

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.415 align:middle line:90%

If we could just build bridges
instead of all these walls.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's where we have to be.

are more enlightened

than a lot of people.

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be counseling,
building bridges, building

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.790 align:middle line:90%
bridges.

It was total peace
and total communion.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.820 align:middle line:90%
We're all working together.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:41.430 align:middle line:90%

So don't feel bad
if, you know, you

don't like zoom up right away.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.995 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
something else

00:50:27.995 --> 00:50:30.760 align:middle line:84%
has to get out of the way
for your light to come up

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.772 align:middle line:90%
your central power curve.

00:50:32.772 --> 00:50:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Because basically it starts
down here at your first chakra.

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.147 align:middle line:84%
And it has to go all the
way up and out for us

00:50:37.147 --> 00:50:40.970 align:middle line:84%
to pick more of you up
up here above your head.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's your light that
we're bringing down.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.670 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.190 align:middle line:84%
You are a
multidimensional being.

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:50.410 align:middle line:84%

the size of your body.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And a lot more of
it can come in.

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You can integrate it into
this three dimensional body.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.840 align:middle line:90%
It has to be done slowly.

I'm careful to make sure not to
hit you with too much too soon.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:07.285 align:middle line:84%

and this is much lighter.
