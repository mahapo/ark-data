00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>> We come here to learn.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We're here for a
pursuit of knowledge.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:84%
We have an emotional connection
to everybody in this room.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.470 align:middle line:90%
We're here for a reason.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Today, you're going to learn.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.080 align:middle line:90%
Listen to Billy.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Please, Conscious Life Expo
2020, welcome my friend,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Billy Carson.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.226 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks, Jimmy, I really
appreciate that, man.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.223 align:middle line:10%
So today, This is my
logo for the mystery

00:00:34.223 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:10%
school, which was made by
Gaia, actually, years ago.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.973 align:middle line:10%
It's one of the first
images they ever

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:41.080 align:middle line:10%
gave me to promote the Gaia
program when I was on "Deep

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.815 align:middle line:10%
Space" and a few other things.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:45.190 align:middle line:10%
It's like a marketing piece,
but it's a phenomenal piece.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.795 align:middle line:10%
It's really showing, to me,
the elevation of consciousness

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.380 align:middle line:10%
in walking through
that, which is really

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:10%
a star tetrahedron
at the top, kind

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.770 align:middle line:10%
of in the seed-of-life
pattern, which is a merkaba.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But today, we're going to talk
about merkaba quantum walking,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to talk about
the merkaba, what it is,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.900 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to get
very scientific, OK?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to do it
in a way that everybody's

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
going to be able to
understand what I'm saying.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The way that I do my lectures
and the way that I teach

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is more based on physics, and
sciences, esoteric wisdom,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge from ancient
sages and handed down

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
verbal histories as well so I
can give you a breakdown of how

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
this stuff works.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the biggest problem
that I find in society

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.070 align:middle line:84%
is when it comes
to knowledge, is

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
we've learned how to
memorize the answers,

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and we don't know how
to get to the answer.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
If I give you a
multiplication test right now,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.490 align:middle line:84%
everybody in here,
I hope, I hope

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
can give me the
answer to 2 times

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.238 align:middle line:84%
2 and 4 times 4 and
so forth and so on.

00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%
But how do you know the answer?

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.633 align:middle line:84%
Because you memorize
the answers.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You just went down the
answer column as a kid,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
and you memorized, oh,
when I see this, it's this.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.240 align:middle line:84%
But did you ever take the
time to figure out why 2 times

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
2 equals this, why 5
times 5 equals this?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have never
taken the time to do that.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And that just transcends into
every other aspect of life.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to
just know answers.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:84%
We're taught in school to
be good test takers, OK,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
but never really understanding
the process to get from A to B.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.668 align:middle line:84%
And so what I like
to do when I teach

00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:20.960 align:middle line:84%
these things-- because we're
dealing with spirituality,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
but spirituality is deeply
entangled with quantum physics

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:90%
and quantum mechanics.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:90%
You can't escape it.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.910 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.215 align:middle line:84%
When I show you today what
I'm going to show you,

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
you're going to realize
it can't be separated.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:90%
They both two go together.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Science and mainstream wants you
to think spirituality over here

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:90%
and science over here.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
That's another
divide-and-conquer tactic

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:84%
to keep you from reaching
your ultimate goal

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual attainment, OK?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
the fundamental underlying

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:84%
basis of why this
stuff actually works.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
spend some time on that

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:84%
because when you walk
out of here today,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:84%
the main thing I want
everybody to take with them

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
is, now, I understand when I
think this way, when I think

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that way, when I pray
this way, when I do this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
or when I do that, this
is why it's working.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you will be able to
see the step-by-step process

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and actually visualize
something in your head

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that's actually,
really truly happening.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think when you
can visualize what's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.990 align:middle line:84%
happening, you know what's
happening versus relying

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
on thinking it's a magic sky
daddy with a magic wand like,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.710 align:middle line:84%
bing, it happened, some kind of
genie coming out of a bottle,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
your wish is my command, I think
when I take that part of it

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.003 align:middle line:84%
away and give you the
power into yourself

00:03:34.003 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and let you understand,
oh, the power's in me,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and I can do this,
and I can do that,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I
can do this and I

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
can do that, I think it's going
to be a lot more-- a lot better

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:middle line:84%
for you, and a lot
better for your family,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and people that you try to
show the information to.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.488 align:middle line:84%
So without further
ado, let's get into it.

00:03:50.488 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I always play my
little intro here.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I like this intro.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.203 align:middle line:90%
I'm that red guy.

00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:09.516 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:09.516 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.881 align:middle line:10%
Like Jimmy said, I'm
a field researcher,

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.339 align:middle line:10%
and this is important
for me to say

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:10%
because people need to
understand I'm not just

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.650 align:middle line:10%
on Google searching images--

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.690 align:middle line:10%
and not to take anything
away from people

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:10%
that's all that they have
access to because that's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:10%
better than the average person.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.603 align:middle line:84%
But to get to the level
that I'm teaching at,

00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:34.270 align:middle line:84%
you have to get out
in the field and you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.560 align:middle line:90%
gotta get your hands dirty.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to get out there and
talk to homegrown researchers.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.897 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
out there and talk

00:04:38.897 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
to homegrown archaeologists,
people who come from that area,

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
from that region,
indigenous people.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You can't just rely on this
generalized Wikipedia-type

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:48.532 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
can't really rely

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.862 align:middle line:84%
on everybody's YouTube
videos, either.

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You gotta go out
there for yourself

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.277 align:middle line:84%
and get some
answers for yourself

00:04:55.277 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it
to everything else

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that you heard, saw, and read,
and then take the information

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that you can best do it
and piece it together.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm am at the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm inside the King's
Chamber, and I'm

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:84%
standing right next to that box
that they call a "sarcophagus."

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:90%
I can't even fit in that box.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm too tall.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm six foot 4, and my
feet come up to my chest

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.013 align:middle line:90%
when got inside of that thing.

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:19.180 align:middle line:84%
But what's really amazing,
it's the exact dimensions

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the Covenant,
and the Ark of the Covenant

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.627 align:middle line:90%
used to sit inside of that box.

00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
they chased Moses--

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.002 align:middle line:84%
who was really truly
Akhenaten-- the reason

00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:84%
why they chased Akhenaten down
if after fled from Egypt, well,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
first, Akhenaten
fled from Egypt--

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.758 align:middle line:84%
he was kicked out
of Egypt I should

00:05:32.758 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
say because he was
defacing all the gods.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:90%
The sun disc, Aten or Amun--

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Amun-Ra, Amen,
the Amen, gave him

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
the order to deface all gods.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.000 align:middle line:84%
There'll be no
other god but him.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
He ushered in monotheistic
mindset into Egypt,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and he was erasing the
history of the hieroglyphs.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the broken
faces and noses come from,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
sorry to say.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.792 align:middle line:84%
I thought initially, too,
when I had heard the rumors--

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:58.292 align:middle line:84%
you see why you can't listen
to YouTube and stuff like that?

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Until I got on an airplane,
and went out there for myself,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and saw temples that had
8,000-year-old hieroglyphs that

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.192 align:middle line:84%
were all chipped off,
there was no nobody going,

00:06:08.192 --> 00:06:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I gotta chip these off to hide
the fact of who these people

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:90%
were.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm sorry.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:90%
That was done by Amun-Ra.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the glyphs.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.352 align:middle line:90%
Amun-Ra ordered it.

00:06:17.352 --> 00:06:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And Akhenaten fled out of
there and left out of there

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:90%
with that Ark of the Covenant.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And when the pharaoh
realized that he

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.080 align:middle line:84%
took the source of
power, the new pharaoh,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:90%
they had to chase him down.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't cross the Red Sea.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
That's the mistranslation
in the King James Bible.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:84%
He crossed the Sea of Reeds,
a much closer and much smaller

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
sea as well.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's just by
translating down into Aramaic,

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can easily
figure that out.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people
know about it

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the people that
are teaching the information,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.438 align:middle line:84%
but they'll never change the
story because it just sounds--

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the historical version,
the mythological version

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:90%
sounds too fantastic.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it's really
amazing stuff.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
had meters per second.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.505 align:middle line:84%
They had the metric
system in ancient times.

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Forget about what you
know about, oh, we just

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
got the metric system and so
forth and so, 1960 or whatever.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:90%
That's garbage.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Whoever that was, I forgot
the gentleman's name

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
in this moment,
he probably found

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
these proto-Sumerian
tablets that

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
were found in Mexico, which
are well documented that they

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
had a metric system back
then, proto-Sumerian.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Proto-Sumerian found
in the South Americas,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:90%
OK, on this side of the ocean.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.842 align:middle line:90%
They had a metric system.

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And what's really amazing
is the speed of light

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%
can be discovered--

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
the longitude of
the Grand Gallery

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
is the same digits of the speed
of light in meters per second.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
This whole structure
was designed

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
this way for a
specific reason, to let

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
us know how technologically
advanced these beings were.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And they turned
the Great Pyramid

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.702 align:middle line:84%
into a multi-functional
stone computer.

00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:84%
This is me at the
Temple of Abydos.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.377 align:middle line:10%
So I'm standing there actually
pointing directly up--

00:07:50.377 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:10%
it's kind of blurred
up here, I guess.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's better
on the corners.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:10%
I'm pointing up at these glyphs.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:10%
It's about maybe 40
meters above my head.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.810 align:middle line:10%
But these glyphs were not
re-etched over, recarved over,

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:10%
what the mainstream
would tell you.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:10%
If you get the homegrown
archaeologists like I had,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:10%
they will tell you that they're
told to say that by the tourism

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.290 align:middle line:10%
board, to tell everybody that,
oh, these are just mistakes.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:10%
They're accidents.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.132 align:middle line:10%
They didn't really exist.

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:18.673 align:middle line:10%
No, he said not only are
they carved that way,

00:08:18.673 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:10%
but there's many more
around the region,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:10%
and he showed me
the other ones, OK?

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:10%
And some of those I had
to pay off pyramid priests

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.888 align:middle line:10%
and guards to go into
underground crypts and stuff

00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:10%
to get down there
to see these things

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.020 align:middle line:10%
and take pictures of them.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:90%
So they're real.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
There's not just this
one spot at Abydos.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
There are depictions of advanced
technology all over Egypt.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the top of
Ollantaytambo in Peru.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.260 align:middle line:90%
This was an amazing trip.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:10%
I saw so much stuff there
that would just blow you away.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the Osirian Temple, which
is right by Abydos, where they

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.320 align:middle line:84%
discovered the flower
of life symbol,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.195 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can
see it from where you

00:08:58.195 --> 00:09:00.360 align:middle line:90%
are, etched into a pillar by--

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
etched into it like on the
atomic level, not carved

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
or chipped into the
stone, but atomically

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:84%
etched directly into the pillars
there, the flower of life,

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
which is everything to do
with the pure energy that

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
creates everything we see
in the third dimension.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.648 align:middle line:84%
They knew about that
10,000, 15,000 years ago.

00:09:17.648 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I think the Osirian's
even older than that.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:84%
My opinion of Syrians probably
around $50,000 to $60,000 years

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Here at Machu Picchu, just kind
of giving you guys an idea.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.897 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been all around
the world, Sacsayhuaman.

00:09:31.897 --> 00:09:33.105 align:middle line:90%
This is my guide here, Elvis.

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:35.580 align:middle line:90%
His name is actually Elvis.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.678 align:middle line:90%
And he's a homegrown indigenous.

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Behind these stones
here-- the reason

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.762 align:middle line:84%
why I took a picture
at those stones,

00:09:40.762 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:84%
right behind those
stones is gold.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:90%
It's protected by the military.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.450 align:middle line:10%
Still gold behind a
lot of these stones.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:10%
And here I'm in
Cambodia at Angkor Wat.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:10%
Here, I'm at Ta Prohm and
showing there's dinosaurs.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.310 align:middle line:10%
This is just one
place in the world

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:10%
that you can see dinosaurs and
human beings at the same time--

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:10%
dinosaurs with the meat on
their bones, which means they

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.562 align:middle line:10%
knew what they looked
like, obviously.

00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:08.770 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to kind of just
extrapolate what this thing

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.270 align:middle line:10%
would look like, but if you go
to Gobekli Tepe you got those

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.110 align:middle line:10%
13,000-year old
columns with dinosaurs.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
You go to Lake
Michigan, and they

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
discovered a Stonehenge in the
bottom of Lake Michigan, etched

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.010 align:middle line:90%
into it what?

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Dinosaurs with the
meat on their bones.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So man and dinosaur
walked the earth together

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.550 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm in Akrotiri
Greece at a dig site.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:84%
This is an ancient dig site, one
of the Atlantean civilizations.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And what was so amazing
here was that they still

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
had flushing toilets from
the second floor level down,

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and it had a suction system
to suck away the smell away

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
from your house.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:90%
We need those now, I think.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We need to incorporate
that new technology.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
You saw blocks that were
maybe 8 to 10 feet thick,

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:84%
with tiny holes
starting from one side

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
going all the way
through to the other.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:90%
Incredible.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:08.247 align:middle line:84%
And plumbing piping that
looked like PVC plastic,

00:11:08.247 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:90%
all here at this dig site.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.497 align:middle line:84%
I did a huge article and
showed a lot of the photos.

00:11:11.497 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
It's on my blog on
Forbidden Knowledge.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.845 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'm standing on the top
of the Pyramid of the Moon,

00:11:15.845 --> 00:11:17.530 align:middle line:84%
which Thoth dedicated
to his wife.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.295 align:middle line:84%
It's actually eight
pyramids built into one.

00:11:20.295 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
Pyramid of the Moon is.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And behind me is the
Pyramid of the Sun,

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.188 align:middle line:84%
and the Avenue of the
Dead is down below.

00:11:27.188 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:90%
I've been to the Yucatan.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've just been
to so many places.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.805 align:middle line:84%
So the point of this is just
to say if you didn't know,

00:11:33.805 --> 00:11:34.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm a world traveler.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been around the
world 2 and 1/2 times now,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:90%
and I'm continuing to travel.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
In 2020, I've got the Kailasa
temples, the Ellora temples,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
both are mountains
that are carved out

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.998 align:middle line:90%
from the outside going in.

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
documentary on both those

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.030 align:middle line:84%
and the technology
used to cover those.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.400 align:middle line:84%
I just came back from
Australia, eight miles out

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:84%
in the Australian bush
with fires all around.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.380 align:middle line:84%
One site we couldn't get to,
it was already destroyed,

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:84%
it was a cave painting,
8,000-year old cave painting

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:middle line:90%
site.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:90%
And already, it was gone.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't documenting,
which is the sad part.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.337 align:middle line:84%
It was poorly grained
images and videos--

00:12:12.337 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
you couldn't really
make out what was there.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But when I got to my site,
the fact that I really,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.400 align:middle line:84%
really went for it Kariong
nine, I was able to very clearly

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.360 align:middle line:84%
document these proto-Egyptian
glyphs and also Pleiades

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.950 align:middle line:90%
glyphs--

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.523 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian glyphs.

00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
So this Gosford
glyphs documentary

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:90%
is going to be mind-blowing.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.538 align:middle line:84%
And I got to get with
elders and everything else.

00:12:34.538 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And the craziest part was, we're
eight miles out in the bush,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
we decide to camp out on a
cliff face, take a break,

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and we hear the bushes
rustling behind us.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're like, there's nothing
but the cliff and this bush.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Is this the animal?

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Two people come out the bush.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.207 align:middle line:84%
They're stumbling
around completely lost.

00:12:51.207 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:10%
It happens the guy-- the guide
said sometimes people are there

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:10%
for three or four days.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They were so happy
to see human beings.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And the guy goes, mate,
you're Billy Carson!

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I got your book!

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Can I take a selfie
was his next--

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.742 align:middle line:90%
not water, not food.

00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want to give
his girlfriend anything.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.700 align:middle line:84%
She was looking
completely deranged.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.746 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK?

00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And we helped them get out
of there and everything.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:90%
That was wild.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can't just
stumble into the bush

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%
and find these glyphs.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even if
you gave me a map,

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:35.810 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have found them.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
That's how difficult
it was to get to.

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's a ritual
to get to these glyphs.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:84%
For the aborigine
elders, if you walk down

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
on one of these ancient
sacred sites, it's an insult.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like slapping or
spitting them in the face.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You have to come from the
bottom coming up, which

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
means a glyph or an area that
has artifacts that can take you

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
maybe 15, 20 minutes to
get to might take you

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.862 align:middle line:84%
an hour and a half
because you've

00:14:00.862 --> 00:14:02.570 align:middle line:84%
got to go all the way
around the long way

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.830 align:middle line:84%
so you can come from the bottom
coming up to show respect.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a lot to it.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.770 align:middle line:90%
It was a great day.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It was a great day.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.785 align:middle line:84%
I've done that--
I've been hiking

00:14:11.785 --> 00:14:16.070 align:middle line:84%
37 miles in the Cambodian
jungles, 100-degree

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
temperature, 100%
humidity every single day.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.732 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it's just
been an amazing ride.

00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm here to give
you information today

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
to talk about some
of the information

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I've learned from the
pyramid priest with regards

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.230 align:middle line:90%
to the merkaba.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I learned
this information

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful
it really truly is,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I learned it had a lot to
do with light, actual light,

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a light
being and understanding

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:90%
that we are a light being.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.828 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
a lot today about light,

00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and the aspect of light, and
what light is really all about.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about how that interacts

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.400 align:middle line:84%
with your consciousness
and how it allows

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.165 align:middle line:90%
you to manifest your reality.

00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So a variety of a variety
of mystery religions

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.965 align:middle line:84%
existed in the ancient world,
such as the mystery of Demeter

00:15:00.965 --> 00:15:04.272 align:middle line:84%
at Eleusis, Mithras,
and Orpheus--

00:15:04.272 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
you know you heard of
Morpheus on "The Matrix?"

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, Orpheus is actually a true
religion, believe it or not.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:90%
That's where they got it from.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.938 align:middle line:84%
A lot of things will correlate
with "The Matrix," as you'll

00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:15.830 align:middle line:90%
see throughout my presentation.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Swearing oaths to keep
proceedings secret.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.420 align:middle line:84%
As result the substance
of their beliefs

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of their ritual
has been almost entirely lost.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:10%
So we're like a
species with amnesia,

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:10%
which you've heard before.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:10%
What happens is,
in these mystery

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:10%
schools, which were handpicked
people, what would happen

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:10%
after a certain amount
of time, the information

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:10%
would get lost because new
initiates wouldn't be selected.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
As these deified gods would
leave, disappear, die,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:90%
go wherever they go--

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.150 align:middle line:84%
it's just like if I
started a rumor here

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
with this man in his ear and
whispered to him and said,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%
pass it on.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
By the time it got all the
way around through everybody

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and got back to
this side, this lady

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
will have a slightly different
story than what I told you.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's what happens
in this whole thing

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
about these secret societies
and these ancient mysteries.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.430 align:middle line:84%
When it's all handed
down verbally,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:middle line:84%
you never really get the
exact same story that went in.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And then over time,
things get forgotten.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So if by midway through that
journey of the information

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.858 align:middle line:84%
going around,
there's a cataclysm

00:16:14.858 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:84%
and now a whole
generation has passed

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
before somebody that
was a last survivor who

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
heard a little bit
from their mother

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
when they were eight years old
can now tell their children,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
now it's a little bit
more conjecture in there.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So we have lost a
lot of information.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
We all know how to
use a cell phone,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
but if there was an
E&P post right now

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that knocked out all
electronics, none of us

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
in here, maybe somebody in
here can, but most of us

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.720 align:middle line:90%
couldn't make a cell phone.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.075 align:middle line:84%
And if we could, we can't
make everything else

00:16:40.075 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that needs to work along
with the cell phone system

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:90%
to make it a functioning system.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very tricky
thing, and it's very easy

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:90%
to get this amnesia.

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.580 align:middle line:84%
People always wonder, how
do we lose all of this?

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.480 align:middle line:90%
It really is so easy.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.320 align:middle line:84%
We've only been existing
for literally less

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.203 align:middle line:84%
than a blink of an eye on
a geological timescale,

00:16:57.203 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:90%
less than a blink of an eye.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.453 align:middle line:84%
Less than the time it takes
you to blink your eye,

00:17:00.453 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
human beings have been on
this planet, if you look

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:90%
at a geological time scale.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And when a small cataclysm, a
small kingship that dominates

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:84%
or whatever takes over like
the papal inquisitions,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't have the
papal inquisitions,

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.869 align:middle line:84%
the Arabs would have been
on the moon in the 1800s.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:22.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how fast
they were advancing.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
In the 1800s, they would
have been on the moon.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.470 align:middle line:84%
The papal inquisition
killed 80 million people

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:84%
and dominated Catholicism
around the entire planet

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
through, unfortunately, murder,
rape, and torture, and force.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's how come everybody
speaks these various languages,

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:10%
not their indigenous languages.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:10%
But it's just the
fact it happened.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:10%
But that slowed down.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:10%
So things like that pop
up from time to time

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:10%
and then just squash out
a lot of our advancement

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:10%
and take us back down that
rabbit hole into this amnesia

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.440 align:middle line:10%
state.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:90%
The force is real.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's primarily what
we're talking about today,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.890 align:middle line:84%
the force, the energy
force, the thing

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that really, truly binds us
like Yoda says in "Star Wars."

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.590 align:middle line:90%
It's really a true statement.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look
back at "Star Wars"

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
after being more
conscious, you realize

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
how many super
nuggets were dropped,

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
like knowledge bombs were
dropped in "Star Wars," right?

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, amazing stuff.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
They really went and
got some real gurus

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:90%
to drop some of that dialogue.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And the force truly
is this energetic grid

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
sitting on right now.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of this energetic
grid, and we're all connected.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So the illusion
of this separation

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:84%
here gives us the
feeling of individuality.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But in truthfulness, I'm up
here talking to you guys,

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.723 align:middle line:90%
but I'm talking to myself.

00:18:36.723 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to myself.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking to somebody,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:90%
you're talking to yourself.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:90%
There's only one consciousness.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The only thing
that's different here

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness has
literally separated itself

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
into trillions and
trillions of entities

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to experience
itself subjectively

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.740 align:middle line:84%
from different
perspectives because it

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.560 align:middle line:90%
wants to collect information.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I just came from
a spiritual panel,

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.597 align:middle line:90%
and we were talking about--

00:18:55.597 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I talked a little bit
about how the brain is

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.810 align:middle line:90%
encased in darkness.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And the brain doesn't
know anything.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't see,
smell, feel, hear.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know nothing.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.202 align:middle line:90%
It's encased in darkness.

00:19:04.202 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:90%
But it has friends, your senses.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So it says to its
friends, go out there

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.490 align:middle line:90%
and collect some information.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
This is as above, so below.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Keep this in mind.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.980 align:middle line:84%
So the brain, it would
be consciousness,

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
the creating consciousness of
this entire third dimension.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Think about it that way.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The brain sends out hearing,
smell, touch, feel, sight,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and they come back with data
digital bits of information.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Information that the brain
now can collect and process,

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and then the brain projects
a hologram as to what's

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
going on outside,
and you'd navigate

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
through this
electromagnetic matrix base

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:84%
off a hologram projected from
digital bits of zeros and ones

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:90%
collected by a sensory system.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:84%
So if you take that and
bring it up to above,

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
now think of the mass
divine consciousness that

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:90%
creates this entire universe.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And we are the friends of that
consciousness that have now

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
broken off, and we're out here
doing, what, collecting data.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:90%
That's your mission here.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:84%
You're collecting
data and sending it,

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to find out,
directly back to source

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:90%
on a consistent basis.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
you're uploading information
back to source non-stop.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.215 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it's all about.

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla had
a famous saying.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
"The day science begins to
study non-physical phenomena,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:84%
it will make more
progress in one decade

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.900 align:middle line:84%
than in all previous
centuries in its existence."

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
non-physical phenomena.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about the unseen.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
take away the magic sky

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
daddy with the white
robe and the wand.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%
We're taking that away.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.243 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:20:41.243 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
If you believe in
that, then you may not

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.555 align:middle line:84%
want to stay through
this presentation.

00:20:44.555 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that there's
not a divine creator, because I

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
believe in a divine creator
because quantum physics tells

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
me that there's a divine
creator of this realm.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:84%
The energy in you is
divine, making you divine,

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
making you a creator as well
or nothing would be here.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:90%
This book wouldn't be written.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
This podium wouldn't be created.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:90%
This laptop wouldn't exist.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.760 align:middle line:84%
All of us are
creators because why?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We're duplicating
what the creator does.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying to
you is there's a process

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
to get to this level
of understanding

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make this
creation and manifest reality,

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and that involves quantum
mechanics and quantum physics.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:10%
That's the underlying basis.

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That's 2 times 2.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.518 align:middle line:10%
All things in all universes
move according to law,

00:21:27.518 --> 00:21:29.810 align:middle line:10%
and the law which regulates
the movement of the planets

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:33.260 align:middle line:10%
is no more mutable than the law
which regulates the material

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:10%
expressions of man.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
of all cosmic laws

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:84%
is that which is responsible
for the formation of man

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:90%
as a material being.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
The main objective is to reveal
the workings of the law, which

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:84%
connect the man, the material,
and man the spiritual.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The connecting link
between the material man

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual man
is the intellectual man,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
for the mind partakes of both
the material and immaterial

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%
qualities.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
The aspirant for
higher knowledge

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.040 align:middle line:84%
must develop the intellectual
side of his nature

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and so strengthen
his will that is

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
able to concentrate
all powers of his being

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:90%
on and in the plane he desires.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
The great search for
light, life, and love only

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.160 align:middle line:84%
begins on the material plane,
carry it to its ultimate.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Its final goal is
complete oneness

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:84%
with the universal
consciousness.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:84%
The foundation in the
material is the first step,

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
then comes the higher goal,
the spiritual attainment.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Concealed in the words of
Thoth are many meanings that

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:90%
do not appear on the surface.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Light of knowledge brought
to bear on these tablets

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
will open many new
fields for thought.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Read and be wise,
but only if the light

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of your own consciousness
awakens a deep-seated

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:84%
understanding, which is the
inherent quality of the soul.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.685 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about some
deep stuff here today, guys,

00:22:43.685 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to go in.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.550 align:middle line:90%
We're going to really get deep.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.908 align:middle line:84%
The universe runs
on natural laws.

00:22:48.908 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the laws
that I talk about quite a bit.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.850 align:middle line:10%
Binding immutable
conditions that

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:10%
govern the consequences
of behavior;

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.110 align:middle line:10%
general principles
of natural law;

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:10%
the principle of
mentalism, which

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.110 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk
about right away;

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:10%
the principle of correspondence;
the principle of vibration;

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:10%
the principle of polarity;
the principle of rhythm;

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.223 align:middle line:10%
the principle of
cause and effect;

00:23:07.223 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:10%
and the principle of gender.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The principle of
mentalism, which is really,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.990 align:middle line:84%
primarily, the majority
of what we've got to talk

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
about today is understanding
it all is mind.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mind.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:84%
We are most likely living in a
fractal holographic conscious

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.290 align:middle line:90%
mind matrix.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so when you look and analyze
the way that the synapses occur

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:84%
between the neurons
in the brain,

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.020 align:middle line:84%
you begin to realize that it
creates this holographic type

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
of a field that
your brain projects,

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same exact
thing for the universe.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in a
fractal holographic matrix.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.618 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
take away the fact

00:23:45.618 --> 00:23:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that it could be a
biological entity.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just that's
the format that's

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.670 align:middle line:84%
used to generate this
illusion of reality.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you think
you're sitting here

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:90%
is even an illusion.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.000 align:middle line:84%
There's $7.5 billion
people on Earth.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But if I take away all the
empty space and the atoms

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of every person
on this planet, I

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.650 align:middle line:84%
can fit everybody
into one sugar cube.

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:90%
You're not even here.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.385 align:middle line:90%
You're not even here.

00:24:11.385 --> 00:24:13.292 align:middle line:84%
This is what you've
got to understand.

00:24:13.292 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, one of
the white papers I'm working on

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is talking about atoms are
99.999% percent empty space.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the white papers
I'm talking about with--

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:90%
working on trash dumps--

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is removing empty-- using a
specific type of energy source

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to remove the empty
space, collapse

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:84%
the empty space between
the atoms and the trash.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:84%
You can have 50 tons of
trash be less than a crumb

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:84%
if you can remove
the empty space.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's the future
of trash management.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.370 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
burning, and trying

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to turn it into gas, and all
this other kind of crazy stuff.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be just removing
the empty space in atoms,

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
and it's gone.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Memory.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:58.190 align:middle line:84%
So some scientists got
20 people together,

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.255 align:middle line:84%
and they took them
out into a city area

00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and said, let's just go
for a walk-- didn't tell me

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
exactly what the
study was truly about,

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
just went for a
walk a few blocks

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:90%
and came back to the laboratory.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to see what
people's minds were picking up

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:90%
subconsciously, subconsciously.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.178 align:middle line:84%
Because your mind records
every single thing.

00:25:16.178 --> 00:25:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Every person that
you saw on your way

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
to this event, every
person's clothing

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.505 align:middle line:84%
or outfit every car you saw
on the way here, every license

00:25:24.505 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
plate that you
didn't realize you

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.160 align:middle line:84%
saw, all that's
stored in your brain.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Every single bit of it's in your
brain right now-- all of it.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.055 align:middle line:84%
Every fine, minute detail is
inside of your brain right now.

00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So they took the people back
and they started asking them

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.060 align:middle line:90%
what did they see?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.143 align:middle line:84%
And they gave them some
very mundane answers-- oh,

00:25:40.143 --> 00:25:43.520 align:middle line:84%
people walking, a few cars,
some offices, and some stores.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Then, they put them under a
hypnosis when a real hypnotist.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And they started tapping
into the subconscious.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.682 align:middle line:84%
And people started recalling
license plate numbers.

00:25:52.682 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:84%
They started recalling what
they saw in store windows

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and what kind of jewelry it was.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:58.280 align:middle line:84%
They started recalling
conversations

00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.988 align:middle line:84%
that they heard as
they were walking down

00:25:59.988 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:84%
the street that people were
talking just as they walked by.

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.222 align:middle line:84%
They even noticed buildings
and signs of stores

00:26:06.222 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that they would never
even think of going into,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but they knew the names
of those stores now,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
and they knew the
names of the signs

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:90%
on the outside of the buildings.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.492 align:middle line:84%
This was a real scientific
study that was done.

00:26:15.492 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Now some people may want to
say it's kind of a pseudo

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.242 align:middle line:84%
because they used
a hypnotist, but it

00:26:19.242 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:90%
was duplicated several times.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.067 align:middle line:84%
And when you duplicate something
and the same thing happens,

00:26:23.067 --> 00:26:25.400 align:middle line:84%
you got to kind of say, this
might have-- this might not

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:90%
be a coincidence.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The human brain is really
picking up everything.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.353 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mind.

00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:31.520 align:middle line:90%
Everything is consciousness.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
You're downloading
information 24 hours a day,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.272 align:middle line:90%
seven days a week, nonstop.

00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They really were able to recall
all these different aspects

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
of the walk that they went
on, and they were, themselves,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:90%
completely surprised about it.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk a
lot about the mind today.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.017 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about the neocortex.

00:26:47.017 --> 00:26:48.350 align:middle line:90%
You know the movie "The Matrix?"

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Neo?

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:10%
Well, they got the name
from the neocortex, OK?

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:10%
And the neocortex is Latin
for "new bark" or "new rind."

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:10%
It's also called the neopallium.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:10%
It's part of the
brain in mammals.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:10%
It's the outer layer of
the cerebral hemispheres

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:10%
and made up of six layers
labeled one through six, six

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.630 align:middle line:10%
being the innermost and
one being the outermost.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:10%
And the neocortex is the
part of the cerebral cortex,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:10%
and it's also sometimes known as
the archicortex or paleocortex.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:10%
They're cortical parts of
the limbic system in humans.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.653 align:middle line:10%
But the most important
part about this

00:27:17.653 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:10%
is it's involved in
higher functions,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.280 align:middle line:10%
such as sensory
perception, generation

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.000 align:middle line:10%
of motor commands, spatial
reasoning, conscious thought,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.570 align:middle line:10%
and language.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.522 align:middle line:10%
So it's not just a name.

00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:30.980 align:middle line:10%
They called him
"Neo" for a reason.

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Conscious thought is the
biggest part of this.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Spatial reasoning, understanding
the world around you,

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
being able to navigate through
this matrix and how it works,

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:90%
and seeing beyond the veil.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
how light equals intelligence.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Light is actually
intelligent-- not only light.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.987 align:middle line:84%
We're going to finding
something else is intelligent,

00:27:51.987 --> 00:27:53.570 align:middle line:84%
but it's really going
to blow you way.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.060 align:middle line:84%
But light definitely
equals intelligence.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
This is from physics.org, the
first ever photograph of a

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.050 align:middle line:84%
what was a light wave and
also then becoming a particle.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So light can be a
wave, a frequency wave,

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and once consciousness
interacts with it,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.360 align:middle line:90%
it can collapse into a particle.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is the very
first photo that

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.540 align:middle line:84%
was taken of light converting
in the middle stages of going

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:90%
from wave to particle.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.235 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:28:20.235 --> 00:28:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
third dimension

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
exists as a light wave first--

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:90%
everything, including your body.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Your body is a wave of
light, a wave of potentials.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic frequencies,
that's all you really--

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.780 align:middle line:90%
your avatar body is.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But your subatomic frequency
will reassimilate back

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
to the structure
that you recognize

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
as you when consciousness
collapses it into that format.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.380 align:middle line:84%
When conscious observers--
in other words,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.590 align:middle line:84%
a person observing you from
the outside or you even

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.200 align:middle line:84%
observing yourself
collapses yourself back

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
into what you recognize
as a solid object.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Right now, you're not at home.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Your home doesn't exist
as a solid object.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Your home is a wave of
light, a wave of potentials,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.100 align:middle line:84%
with a specific frequency
in every block that

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
creates the actual property,
the actual structure.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.730 align:middle line:84%
When you get back to your
house and you get close to it,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.340 align:middle line:84%
it collapses back
into your house again.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Now you're saying, well,
somebody's is at my house

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.390 align:middle line:90%
They see the house.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness collapses
electromagnetic frequencies

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
into solid matter.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to show
you this in real science,

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
real peer-reviewed
science in a second here.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.024 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go to Dr. Quantum.

00:29:34.024 --> 00:29:34.824 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:34.824 --> 00:29:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> What taught us at school
isn't really the way it is

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and that our senses are
playing tricks on us.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
You just gotta wonder,
what is this reality

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
that we find ourselves in?

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics says it's all
just waves of information.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.943 align:middle line:90%
Do I believe that?

00:29:54.943 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:90%
Ah, I hope so!

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.104 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.104 --> 00:30:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Yikes!

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And here we are, the granddaddy
of all quantum weirdness,

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:84%
the infamous double
slit experiment.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:12.770 align:middle line:84%
To understand this
experiment, we first

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:18.710 align:middle line:84%
need to see how particles, or
little balls of matter, act.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
If we randomly shoot
a small object,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.790 align:middle line:84%
say a Marvel at the
screen, we see a pattern

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:30.320 align:middle line:84%
on the back wall, where they
went through the slit and hit.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Now if we add a
second slit, we would

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:37.820 align:middle line:84%
expect to see a second band
duplicated to the right.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.680 align:middle line:90%


00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's look at waves.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The waves hit the
slit and radiate out,

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.800 align:middle line:84%
striking the back wall
with the most intensity

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.190 align:middle line:90%
directly in line with the slip.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The line of brightness
on the back screen

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.360 align:middle line:90%
shows that intensity.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to the
line the marbles make.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:11.220 align:middle line:84%
But when we add the second slit,
something different happens.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
If the top of one wave meets
the bottom of another wave,

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.180 align:middle line:90%
they cancel each other out.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So now, there is an interference
pattern on the back wall.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Places where the two tops meet
are the highest intensity,

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:84%
the bright lines, and where
they cancel, there is nothing.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So when we throw things, that
is matter, through two slits,

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.320 align:middle line:90%
we get this--

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.960 align:middle line:90%
two bands of hits.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And with waves, we get
an interference pattern

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:48.840 align:middle line:90%
of mini bands.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Good so far.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.975 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go quantum.

00:31:52.975 --> 00:31:58.470 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:06.310 align:middle line:84%
An electron is a tiny, tiny bit
of matter, like a tiny marble.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's fire a stream
through one slit.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It behaves just like a
marble, a single band.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we shoot these tiny
bits through two slits,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.990 align:middle line:84%
we should get, like
the marbles, two bands.

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:25.490 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.690 align:middle line:90%
An interference pattern!

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:32.350 align:middle line:84%
We fired electrons, tiny
bits of matter through.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And we get a pattern like
waves, not like little marbles.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.481 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:32:38.481 --> 00:32:42.480 align:middle line:84%
How could pieces of matter
create an interference pattern

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.220 align:middle line:90%
like a wave?

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.240 align:middle line:90%
But physicists are clever.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:84%
They thought maybe
those little balls

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.710 align:middle line:84%
are bouncing off each other
and creating that pattern.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
So they decide to shoot
electrons through one

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.080 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.380 align:middle line:84%
There is no way they could
interfere with each other.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.860 align:middle line:84%
But after an hour of this,
the same interference pattern

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:90%
has seemed to emerge.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.250 align:middle line:90%
The conclusion is inescapable.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:16.300 align:middle line:84%
The single electron
leaves as a particle,

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.290 align:middle line:84%
becomes a wave of potentials,
goes through both slits,

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and interferes with itself to
hit the wall like a particle.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.700 align:middle line:84%
But mathematically,
it's even stranger.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:84%
It goes through both slits,
and it goes through neither.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through
just one, and it

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:90%
goes through just the other.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.680 align:middle line:84%
All of these possibilities
are in superposition

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.820 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Physicists were completely
baffled by this,

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.580 align:middle line:10%
so they decided to
peek and see which

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.380 align:middle line:10%
slit it actually goes through.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They put a measuring
device by one slit

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.872 align:middle line:84%
to see which one it went
through and let it fly.

00:33:55.872 --> 00:34:00.790 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] But the quantum
world is far more mysterious

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:90%
than they could have imagined.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:06.550 align:middle line:84%
When they observed,
the electron went back

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to behaving like
a little marble.

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It produced a pattern of two
bands, not an interference

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.100 align:middle line:90%
pattern of many.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:21.170 align:middle line:84%
The very act of measuring
or observing which slit.

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:26.719 align:middle line:84%
It went through meant it only
went through one, not both.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:31.745 align:middle line:84%
The electron decided
to act differently,

00:34:31.745 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:84%
as though it was aware
it was being watched.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.020 align:middle line:84%
It was here that
physicists stepped forever

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:45.218 align:middle line:84%
into the strange never
world of quantum events.

00:34:45.218 --> 00:34:47.659 align:middle line:90%
What is matter?

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:90%
Marbles or waves?

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And waves of what?

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:57.573 align:middle line:84%
And what does an observer
have to do with any of this?

00:34:57.573 --> 00:34:59.010 align:middle line:10%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So you see, the act of
looking, observation,

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
conscious intervention
collapses waves

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.760 align:middle line:90%
into potential solid objects.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.688 align:middle line:84%
This is science
fact, not fiction.

00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So when I tell you
that your house is

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic wave of
light when you're not there,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.240 align:middle line:90%
that's what it is.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.180 align:middle line:84%
If you play a video game-- as
above, so below never fails.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:84%
A video game is the
exact reproduction

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.700 align:middle line:90%
of how we live our lives.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.530 align:middle line:84%
The next frame appears as you
need it in the video game.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you move forward,
the next part of the frame

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.960 align:middle line:84%
appears and the next
challenge appears.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
reincarnation and video games.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.897 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you don't learn
your lesson and you get killed,

00:35:39.897 --> 00:35:43.420 align:middle line:84%
you get another life and
you start all over again.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below never fails.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.577 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we're doing.

00:35:48.577 --> 00:35:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So a human being exists
both as solid matter

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and a wave of light.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.443 align:middle line:90%
So you are light.

00:35:54.443 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And what do we know
about light and what

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:90%
do we know about electrons?

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:90%
They're intelligent.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.050 align:middle line:90%
Light has intelligence, OK?

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.790 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that you really

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:06.490 align:middle line:84%
have to understand because
this is the fundamental basis

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.230 align:middle line:90%
of getting to the next level.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Understanding that every
single atom in your body

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:90%
is intelligent.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
that's important

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.080 align:middle line:84%
is because you have
trillions and trillions

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.900 align:middle line:84%
of atoms in your body that
make up your body, OK?

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.783 align:middle line:84%
So add all that
consciousness together.

00:36:22.783 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It's really incredible
the amount of potential

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.820 align:middle line:90%
that a human being has.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Now word of the week,
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you can see here--
red, orange, yellow, green,

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:34.600 align:middle line:84%
blue, and violet
you guys know of

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.640 align:middle line:84%
are the light waves
that we normally

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:90%
can see as human beings.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Everything else we can't see it.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.740 align:middle line:90%
We just can't see it.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.965 align:middle line:90%
And it's a good thing.

00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
can see everything

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.048 align:middle line:84%
that was going on in
this room right now,

00:36:47.048 --> 00:36:49.422 align:middle line:90%
it would freak you out.

00:36:49.422 --> 00:36:50.380 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't handle it.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm just telling you.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.770 align:middle line:84%
If you can see in gamma,
you can see X-ray,

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:58.250 align:middle line:84%
if you can see in
multi-spectrum, ultraviolet,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:84%
infrared, you'd see all kinds of
things happening all around us

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.020 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.510 align:middle line:90%
And you'd be like, what?

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So we've been set up with this
limited perception of what

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
we call "visible
light," which is what

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:14.150 align:middle line:84%
you see when you see a
rainbow, as light goes through

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.950 align:middle line:90%
like a fraculate.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.450 align:middle line:84%
It's broken off, and the
different light rays break off,

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and these are the only colors
that we can actually see.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.330 align:middle line:84%
So visible light, the
electromagnetic waves

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.790 align:middle line:84%
of your eyes, that
your eyes can detect,

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:84%
oscillate between 400
and 790 terahertz.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.600 align:middle line:84%
That's several trillion
times a second.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The wavelengths are roughly
the size of a large virus.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:39.780 align:middle line:84%
So we see nothing that's truly,
really going on out here.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And like I said,
here's gamma rays.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You have ultraviolet
light, radar.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:84%
We have this small
slither that we're given

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:90%
that we can get access to.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:90%
But everything is light.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Every atom in your body
is made from light.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.425 align:middle line:84%
And it even goes
deeper than that.

00:37:58.425 --> 00:38:00.550 align:middle line:84%
This is an image from the
Very Large Baseline Array

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.920 align:middle line:84%
that shows a galaxy
M33, what it looks like,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:90%
if you can see in radio waves.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the image map
of the atomic hydrogen

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.070 align:middle line:84%
gas in the galaxy, and
the different colors that

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:90%
map velocities in the gas.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.392 align:middle line:84%
Red gas is always moving away,
and blue is moving towards us.

00:38:14.392 --> 00:38:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I'm
showing you radio waves,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I here ever heard
of "I Love Lucy?"

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, it's an old show.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:22.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm aging myself.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I used to watch it all the time.

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:28.023 align:middle line:84%
But those shows are still
going through space,

00:38:28.023 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
traveling through
space right now.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Those radio waves
that created that show

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.470 align:middle line:84%
or that emanated that show are
still traveling through space

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.830 align:middle line:84%
time, and some distant future
of some alien races able

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:84%
to decode those radio waves,
they can watch "I Love Lucy."

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So think about
that because that's

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.930 align:middle line:84%
a very important
statement I just made.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I just rotated
it just a little bit and look

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.580 align:middle line:90%
what happened.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.128 align:middle line:90%
I'm just messing with you guys.

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:59.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.405 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] galaxy.

00:39:00.405 --> 00:39:02.780 align:middle line:84%
Now it's really amazing that
it is in that shape, though.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:03.613 align:middle line:90%
It really, truly is.

00:39:03.613 --> 00:39:05.628 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird.

00:39:05.628 --> 00:39:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at this video here.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.628 align:middle line:90%


00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:12.428 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:12.428 --> 00:39:17.430 align:middle line:10%
>> So this research is about
alternative ways of storing

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:10%
data, digital data, for
archival purposes with DNA.

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The initial
thought was, you know,

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:28.440 align:middle line:10%
I don't care what I'm building,
and so why don't we just build

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.320 align:middle line:10%
Moby Dick or something?

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll just encode it
in DNA, and we'll just

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.480 align:middle line:84%
build that because I
don't want to worry

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.105 align:middle line:84%
about the design at
this point in time.

00:39:35.105 --> 00:39:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Siriam and I debated
what we should encode,

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.280 align:middle line:84%
what would nicely represent
the digital universe,

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted something that
represents sort of a modern

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:44.590 align:middle line:90%
digital.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So we use an HTML version of
a book that I wrote recently

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.600 align:middle line:90%
called, "Regenesis."

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The HTML form, let's
say the web form,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:90%
includes images, digital images.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.140 align:middle line:84%
It includes JavaScript
programming language

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that actually does perform
something interactively

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:05.420 align:middle line:90%
with the person.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we encoded that into
zeros and ones and then

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.688 align:middle line:90%
into DNA.

00:40:09.688 --> 00:40:11.400 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.432 align:middle line:10%
>> That's important.

00:40:12.432 --> 00:40:13.890 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
that's important

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.120 align:middle line:10%
is because DNA stores memory.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, it's kind
of a long video,

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.390 align:middle line:84%
but to summarize
what he's saying is,

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:84%
these scientists discovered
that DNA can store

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:90%
digital bits of information.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered how to
use the light codes in DNA

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to store data.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And now, that e-book that
he was talking about,

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.580 align:middle line:84%
they replicated it 80 billion
times onto one gram of DNA.

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:84%
A gram is a drop on
the tip of your finger.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.470 align:middle line:84%
So one gram of DNA can store
80 billion copies of that book.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It can store 433 petabytes of
digital data, zeros and ones.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And it can be not only
downloaded to the DNA

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:84%
but uploaded back
to the server again.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered
that it's also wireless.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So now, they've realized
that DNA sends and receives

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.820 align:middle line:90%
information wirelessly.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
When you're picking
up-- this laptop

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.540 align:middle line:84%
is connected to a
Wi-Fi signal right now

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.040 align:middle line:84%
or I wouldn't be able to give
this presentation because some

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.830 align:middle line:84%
of my stuff is linked
through web, right?

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.690 align:middle line:90%
What is a Wi-Fi frequency?

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:90%
What is Wi-Fi?

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.700 align:middle line:90%
Wi-Fi is light.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.500 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Light that then
carries zeros and ones.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So this laptop right now
is sending waves of light

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.380 align:middle line:84%
out to a receiver and
downloading information

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
from that same
receiver back and forth

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.000 align:middle line:84%
with light waves
that have piggybacked

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.030 align:middle line:90%
zeros and ones on top of it.

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.440 align:middle line:90%
Light is the trick here.

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Light is the secret.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Scientists discovered
how to turn light

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:90%
into a physical matter.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.540 align:middle line:90%
It was an 80-year quest.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what happened is
at this [INAUDIBLE] University,

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:84%
these guys got together,
and they started talking,

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and Max Planck
walked in, and they

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
were having a cup
of coffee, trying

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.710 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what Thoth
talked about in the "Compendium

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of the Emerald
Tablets" here, turning

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.350 align:middle line:84%
the light into solid matter
in ancient times, right?

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, they just figured
out how to redo it.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.010 align:middle line:90%
They just rediscovered it.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And they now-- this
is physics.org.

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:12.298 align:middle line:84%
By the way guys, they now have
turned light into solid matter.

00:42:12.298 --> 00:42:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So everything that the
ancients were doing,

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:15.880 align:middle line:90%
we're just now rediscovering.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But if we can turn light into
solid matter, Thoth talks

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.740 align:middle line:84%
about being able to do it
with your own consciousness,

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.260 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'm
going with this.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.640 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it technologically
and figuring out

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:84%
the basis of how
to make it happen,

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.720 align:middle line:84%
but there's a way that
he was able to tap

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.190 align:middle line:90%
into it with his mind.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.980 align:middle line:84%
He manifested blocks to
build megalithic structures.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:39.450 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have to
go quarry them.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:84%
This is the level that we
are trying to ascend to.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Contemporary science tells us
that the universe is made up

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of energy, matter, and light.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Those would be what alchemists
call sulfur, salt, mercury

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:52.450 align:middle line:90%
respectively.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.910 align:middle line:84%
According to Einstein's
equation, E equals MC squared,

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
energy and matter can be
transformed into one another

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:90%
through the constant of light.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:03.010 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, sulfur and salt are
transformed into one another

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.280 align:middle line:84%
through the
intermediary of mercury.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It looks like if the little
C in Einstein's equation

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:84%
really stood for "consciousness"
instead of light,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.350 align:middle line:84%
there would be no
difference at all

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:16.360 align:middle line:90%
between physics and alchemy.

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Just that one little tweak
will turn you from physics

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:20.230 align:middle line:90%
to alchemy.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And let's assume that
consciousness is light.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And in that case, the emerald
tablet for the 21st century

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.580 align:middle line:90%
might look something like this.

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.800 align:middle line:84%
"Truly without hype,
religious exploitation,

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or commercial consideration, you
can experience higher truths.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:84%
You are as much
part of the material

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.010 align:middle line:84%
as you are part of
the mental, and you

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
are as much part of the mental
as you are the material.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.600 align:middle line:84%
In order to accomplish
miracles of light

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and just as all things
come from this light

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.750 align:middle line:84%
through constant thought and
concentration of consciousness,

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.620 align:middle line:84%
so do all creative things
originate from this light

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.820 align:middle line:84%
through the
transformation of thought.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Its father as energy.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Its mother as matter.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The spectrum carries
in its belly.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Its nurse.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It's the earth.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It is the origin
of all consecration

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:90%
of the whole universe.

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Its inherent strength
is perfected.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.180 align:middle line:90%
And it is materialized.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Separate from matter
from imagination,

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.830 align:middle line:84%
subtle from the growth, gently
is the deepest meditation.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.200 align:middle line:84%
The light rises from Earth
to Heaven and returns

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.750 align:middle line:84%
again to Earth, thereby
containing within itself

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:84%
the powers of both the
mental and the material.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Thus will you obtain the
light of the whole universe.

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:23.950 align:middle line:84%
All darkness will
be illumined to you.

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the greatest
force of all powers

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.640 align:middle line:84%
because it overcomes
every mental thing

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and penetrates every
material thing.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.200 align:middle line:84%
It is the way that the
universe was created.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.210 align:middle line:84%
From this comes many
wondrous manifestations

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.380 align:middle line:90%
because of this formula.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.792 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, this deals with
three parts of reality

00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and shows the underlying
relationship between energy,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.390 align:middle line:90%
matter, and light.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have
completely explained

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.230 align:middle line:90%
the fountain of consciousness."

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:46.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, so we're going in, guys.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:90%
This is some deep stuff.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Mapping magnetite crystal
in the human brain--

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:55.070 align:middle line:84%
so how do we download
this light information?

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:58.803 align:middle line:84%
What's the mechanism, the
actual biological technology

00:44:58.803 --> 00:45:00.220 align:middle line:84%
that's inside of
our avatar bodies

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that allows this to happen?

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Mapping the magnetite
crystal, we've

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.880 align:middle line:84%
got magnetite crystals--
billions of crystals inside

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.160 align:middle line:90%
of our brain of magnetite.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Now animals use this all the
time to navigate the planet.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Birds flocks out for the winter.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Turtles know how to get back to
their nesting grounds, right?

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Whales navigate the oceans
using magnetite crystals.

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:21.550 align:middle line:90%
We have them, too.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.800 align:middle line:84%
But we've been
disconnected from them.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Now they put human beings--
not that we've been disconnect.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.520 align:middle line:84%
Somehow a veil's been put
over for us to detect it.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They put a human being
in an actual laboratory

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.120 align:middle line:84%
with a magnetic field, a
very strong magnetic field,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and then they put the cap
on its head with electrodes

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:39.490 align:middle line:90%
to detect magnetism.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And they say, oh,
he's detecting it.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Then, they would move the
field around the room.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.667 align:middle line:84%
And no matter where
they move the field,

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:46.960 align:middle line:84%
they were detecting that
the magnetite crystals

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.350 align:middle line:84%
were following the field
in the brain, human brain.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We still have the
capability today.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But we've been
disconnected from it.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:56.800 align:middle line:84%
We've got to regain
it through meditation,

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.710 align:middle line:84%
through thoughtfulness, through
research and investigation,

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
through studying through
all these different things

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:02.860 align:middle line:90%
for this whole--

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:04.300 align:middle line:90%
this whole expo is about--

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.970 align:middle line:84%
just to get back to where
we're supposed to be.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.800 align:middle line:84%
When you look at tsunamis
that come inland,

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.853 align:middle line:84%
you never see the wild
animals dying in the ocean.

00:46:14.853 --> 00:46:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You never see that,
but you always

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:middle line:84%
see human beings
getting swept away.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.160 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.003 align:middle line:90%
The animals are-- good question.

00:46:23.003 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:90%
She said, why is that?

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
The animals are in
human resonant frequency

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:27.878 align:middle line:90%
with the earth.

00:46:27.878 --> 00:46:29.670 align:middle line:84%
They're utilizing their
magnetite crystals.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.795 align:middle line:84%
They're downloading,
uploading information directly

00:46:31.795 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
from the planet itself
because Earth is conscious.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
warned two, three day,

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:38.995 align:middle line:84%
sometimes a week in advance
before cataclysms happen,

00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and they go to the hills
or to the mountains.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:42.955 align:middle line:84%
Human beings, we go
right to the water,

00:46:42.955 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and then we stand there
with the selfie stick

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:90%
and watch it come in.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And we go, look!

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, boom,
we're out of there.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've really
been disconnected.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:00.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.840 align:middle line:90%
They got us good, man.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.520 align:middle line:84%
They probably sit back
and just laugh, you know?

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.210 align:middle line:90%
But we have the capability.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And to get back
in that frequency,

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to get back in that
resonance, to get back

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.510 align:middle line:84%
in tune with the earth,
and our inner self,

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:20.200 align:middle line:84%
and the universal consciousness,
it takes some thoughtfulness

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to be thoughtful and mindful
that it actually does exist,

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's not some mystery
hokey-pokey thing, right?

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's a real thing that
does exist in your body.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:31.252 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
magnetite crystals are located.

00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing you the evidence
that this stuff is real,

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and it really exists so
that you could take away

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.810 align:middle line:90%
the mysticism of it, OK?

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Here's something that's
really interesting as well.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.280 align:middle line:10%
The neural correlates
of consciousness,

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.070 align:middle line:10%
the parts of your brain that
generates self-awareness,

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.410 align:middle line:10%
researchers at the Allen
Institute for Brain Science

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:10%
discovered three giant
neurons, one of them

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.420 align:middle line:10%
is projected across the
cortex like a crown of thorns.

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.365 align:middle line:90%


00:47:56.365 --> 00:47:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I wish I had a whole nother show
to go into and talk about what

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.730 align:middle line:84%
these stones are really
about because this is really

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:01.150 align:middle line:90%
what it's about.

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with the other thing,

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.350 align:middle line:90%
but that's a whole nother show.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:06.500 align:middle line:90%
But this is real.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.925 align:middle line:90%
This is real science.

00:48:07.925 --> 00:48:08.800 align:middle line:90%
This is real science.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So between the neural
correlates of consciousness,

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:15.310 align:middle line:84%
the neocortex, and the
magnetite crystals,

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%
you now have a
technological device

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.590 align:middle line:84%
anchored to this
avatar body that

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.110 align:middle line:84%
allows you to upload
and download information

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:26.800 align:middle line:90%
directly from spacetime.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.000 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Something to get excited about.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear people
say, I'm getting a download.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.478 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people smirk at
them when they walk away.

00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:90%
No, they're getting a download.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's getting a download.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you go, oh, I had this
great idea for this invention.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.220 align:middle line:90%
No, you downloaded it.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:49.480 align:middle line:84%
All information, and I
mean all information,

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:90%
already exists in spacetime.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.530 align:middle line:90%
Already exists.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.660 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
it exists as what?

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.600 align:middle line:84%
An electromagnetic
frequency of what?

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.900 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, your
neural correlates,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:04.360 align:middle line:84%
your magnetite crystals,
and your consciousness

00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.290 align:middle line:84%
matches a subatomic frequency
or a subspace frequency

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.370 align:middle line:84%
of that information,
that data packet,

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.688 align:middle line:84%
and then you actually
download it into your body.

00:49:13.688 --> 00:49:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you're lucky-- because
everybody downloads it probably

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.920 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, a lot of
people, but you discern it,

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to then
regurgitate it, put action

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.750 align:middle line:84%
behind it, and bring
it into fruition.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.320 align:middle line:90%
That's how things happen.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how things happen.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:32.035 align:middle line:84%
So this entire realm is all
about uploads and downloads.

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear people say
that, you can't laugh at them

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and think they're
crazy because you're

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:37.673 align:middle line:84%
getting the same
exact thing, you just

00:49:37.673 --> 00:49:39.280 align:middle line:90%
didn't realize it before.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:42.350 align:middle line:84%
The neurons connect
to the claustrom.

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And the claustrum, like the
conductor of an orchestra,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.360 align:middle line:84%
it coordinates the
inputs and outputs--

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.180 align:middle line:84%
inputs and outputs-- this
is a technological device

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:51.440 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about--

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.360 align:middle line:84%
which help to download
consciousness.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.320 align:middle line:84%
This is coming from
biological books, some physics

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.420 align:middle line:84%
books, some peer
reviewed science books.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm not giving you stuff that
came from some hocus pocus

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.480 align:middle line:90%
magazine about spirituality.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you
real science here.

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You are downloading
information, and this

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:11.882 align:middle line:90%
is the mechanism used to do it.

00:50:11.882 --> 00:50:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is important
to understand

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because you can't get
into a merkaba meditation

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.275 align:middle line:84%
without understanding
these tactics.

00:50:18.275 --> 00:50:20.390 align:middle line:10%
Now some people have
been able to do it

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:24.160 align:middle line:10%
through going to different
gurus that can teach you

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:24.960 align:middle line:10%
how to do it.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.918 align:middle line:84%
Some people are able to
get into it right away.

00:50:26.918 --> 00:50:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it takes
them a very long time.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't really
understand why it work,

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.390 align:middle line:84%
but they follow the
guidelines, and they've

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.805 align:middle line:84%
done the deal are
the basics that

00:50:33.805 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:84%
were taught to
them by the gurus,

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.680 align:middle line:90%
and they're able to get into it.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to show
you something that

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.490 align:middle line:84%
not only will allow you to
get into but also allow you

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.860 align:middle line:84%
to pass it on to other people
and explain why it works.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So the people go, you're just
another one of crazy gypsies.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to hear what
you're talking about.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:50.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you can explain
something scientifically

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.510 align:middle line:84%
and show source material and
say, no, this is real science.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.210 align:middle line:90%
This is not hocus pocus.

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.762 align:middle line:90%
You might catch somebody's ear.

00:50:58.762 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:84%

So what's being
transmitted from the brain?

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Waves of light--
intelligent light

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.720 align:middle line:84%
that then get picked up by a
receiver below the broken spine

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and then decoded into the
DNA and to the muscle fibers

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.840 align:middle line:90%
and told, hey, move this leg.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the power of your mind.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:23.020 align:middle line:84%

through the power of thought.

00:52:31.998 --> 00:52:33.790 align:middle line:84%
This is adding a little
piece of technology

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.950 align:middle line:84%
that allows the decoding
of the light waves coming

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:90%
from the brain to do that.

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Every single thought
you're thinking right now,

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.640 align:middle line:84%
every thought you're
thinking is generating

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.460 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic wave that's
penetrating your skull bone

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and going out into
spacetime forever.

Every thought that
you ever thought

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
in spacetime-- every
single thought.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:59.440 align:middle line:90%
The Akashic Records, real.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.540 align:middle line:90%
The Book of Life, real.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Because Stephen
Hawking said it best.

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.000 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that when
you go into a black hole,

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.800 align:middle line:90%
oh, guess what?

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.330 align:middle line:90%
I made a mistake earlier, guys.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:12.670 align:middle line:90%
Things don't become destroyed.

00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:15.610 align:middle line:84%
All information as it
enters into the black hole

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.220 align:middle line:84%
is stored at the rim
of the event horizon.

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:19.570 align:middle line:90%
So nothing is ever lost.

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Information can't be destroyed.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:26.590 align:middle line:84%
All knowledge, all
information that ever has been

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:28.540 align:middle line:84%
is always here and
always will be here.

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.460 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is missing.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is gone void.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Nothing has been taken
away from this universe.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.385 align:middle line:90%
It's all here.

00:53:34.385 --> 00:53:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So every thought that you
think is permanently going out.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.093 align:middle line:84%
So the thoughts you think are
very powerful because they

00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:40.720 align:middle line:90%
can affect other people.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I could be thinking a
negative thought from up here

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:47.830 align:middle line:84%
that can then interact with
your field, your biofield,

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:51.130 align:middle line:84%
and your DNA wave, your
torus around your body

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:54.850 align:middle line:84%
that's operating your Wi-Fi
DNA can download my light wave

00:53:54.850 --> 00:54:00.220 align:middle line:84%
into your body and affect you
biologically, physiologically.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.990 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
thought could be.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And just the opposite, you can
walk through a room of people

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.340 align:middle line:84%
just like this, and
you can directly

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.050 align:middle line:84%
affect every single
person in the room

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:09.940 align:middle line:84%
with the power of
positive thought

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.800 align:middle line:90%
without even saying a word.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.917 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
thoughts are.

00:54:14.917 --> 00:54:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some people
walk in the room, people say,

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I can feel the energy.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.020 align:middle line:90%
That's real.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, that is not
an imaginary thing.

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:24.777 align:middle line:90%
That's truly a real thing.

00:54:24.777 --> 00:54:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Kal El, I thought, this
was just very interesting.

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.820 align:middle line:10%
Kal El means "light
god" in Hebrew, which

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.040 align:middle line:10%
is what Superman's name was.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.760 align:middle line:84%
I just thought it was kind
of an interesting tidbit.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But can brainwaves
interfere with radio waves?

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.228 align:middle line:84%
They don't interfere with
radio waves, but the reason

00:54:39.228 --> 00:54:43.160 align:middle line:84%
why I showed this is
because it says here that--

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.870 align:middle line:84%
let's see here--
the human brain also

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.560 align:middle line:84%
admits waves, like when a
person focuses her attention on

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.750 align:middle line:90%
or remembers something.

00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The activity fires
thousands of neurons

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:56.872 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously at the same
frequency generating a wave,

00:54:56.872 --> 00:54:58.580 align:middle line:84%
again, proving this
is more physics here,

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.122 align:middle line:84%
school of engineering,
waves of light

00:55:00.122 --> 00:55:01.430 align:middle line:90%
are coming out of your head.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.662 align:middle line:84%
Radio waves, which include
radio and other wireless

00:55:03.662 --> 00:55:05.870 align:middle line:84%
transmission signals as well
as other natural signals

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:84%
in the same frequency peak
through around 50 to 1,000

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.430 align:middle line:90%
megahertz.

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.930 align:middle line:84%
That's between 50 million
and one billion oscillations

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:13.730 align:middle line:90%
per second.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So every thought that we
have as well also isolated

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.330 align:middle line:90%
a specific frequency.

00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:19.622 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I'm talking
about, frequencies matching

00:55:19.622 --> 00:55:21.260 align:middle line:90%
information in space time.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:24.080 align:middle line:84%
When you match that frequency
of information in spacetime,

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.158 align:middle line:90%
you can download it.

00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:26.450 align:middle line:90%
It even goes further than that.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Quantum walkers, like
I'm talking about,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:31.820 align:middle line:84%
"quantum walking" is a real
term in quantum mechanics.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's a real term.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.932 align:middle line:84%
And how I stumbled across it, I
was doing a walking meditation

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:38.390 align:middle line:84%
on the beach in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida, which I typically

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:40.150 align:middle line:90%
do every two or three weeks.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:41.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like a five-mile walk.

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And it's walking meditation.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.780 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I phased out
of this reality for a

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.992 align:middle line:84%
into another place, but
the place was still here,

00:55:47.992 --> 00:55:49.700 align:middle line:84%
but it was more
technologically advanced.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I went home and I said, I just
feel like I quantum walked.

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I looked it up, and
it's actual real term

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.550 align:middle line:90%
in quantum physics.

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
researching quantum walking

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:01.328 align:middle line:84%
and how it interacted with
merkaba light meditation

00:56:01.328 --> 00:56:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and also how it interacted
with what Thoth talked about

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.570 align:middle line:90%
in the "Emerald Tablets."

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.490 align:middle line:90%
So as above, so below.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:08.990 align:middle line:84%
We learned in a
little cartoon there

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:14.190 align:middle line:84%
that electrons were conscious
because once the electron

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.440 align:middle line:84%
realized that it
was being watched,

00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.110 align:middle line:84%
it decided to act like
a particle, right?

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.530 align:middle line:84%
When it wasn't being watched,
it decided to act like a wave.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.910 align:middle line:90%
So as above, so below.

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're talking about
looking at planets.

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So you see here, you're
looking at an orbiting--

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:31.800 align:middle line:90%
a sun with planets orbiting it.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.490 align:middle line:84%
You look at an atom with
electrons orbiting it, right?

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Planets are conscious.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.560 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Planets are conscious.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.760 align:middle line:90%
This planet is conscious.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And this planet emits
a specific frequency.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.710 align:middle line:84%
All planetary
frequencies have now

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.230 align:middle line:84%
been recorded by
the space agencies.

00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:51.970 align:middle line:84%
You can actually go
online and download

00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:54.700 align:middle line:84%
the sound of every single
planet and every moon

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.020 align:middle line:90%
in our solar system.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And each one has a
different frequency.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you take the sound
waves from NASA.gov or European

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Spac-- wherever you download
them from, they're available,

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.405 align:middle line:84%
and then put them
into an audio program

00:57:06.405 --> 00:57:07.660 align:middle line:90%
and slow it down a little bit.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:11.140 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like conversations.

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.325 align:middle line:90%
That's really interesting.

00:57:12.325 --> 00:57:14.278 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like conversations.

00:57:14.278 --> 00:57:16.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's really important
because your light waves also

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:20.510 align:middle line:84%
interact and directly
affect the planet as well.

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And one of the biggest
problems or one of the biggest

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.095 align:middle line:84%
things that I see with human
beings so far on this planet

00:57:25.095 --> 00:57:28.570 align:middle line:84%
is that we're not in a
resonant frequency in harmony

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.370 align:middle line:90%
with the planet itself.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.520 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of ways, we've been
like a virus on the top.

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
really change that.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And we are changing.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:39.340 align:middle line:84%
We're in the process
of doing it now.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:42.100 align:middle line:84%
We've got to become more in
tune with the planet itself

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and more respect of what the
planet as a sentiment being,

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:47.320 align:middle line:84%
not just a rock to
build a house on.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:50.580 align:middle line:90%

this wild technology.

their offices today

00:58:01.025 --> 00:58:02.400 align:middle line:84%

little bit more.

And so I'll just put
this on like that.

>> On the brain crown, OK.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Uh-huh, and then this
goes behind the ears,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.760 align:middle line:90%
so we'll just slide this down.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.125 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is my
brain right now?

00:58:17.125 --> 00:58:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This is your
brain right now--

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --in real time.

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.300 align:middle line:90%
>> This is wild.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:21.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty wild.

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.200 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing is the
localized activity right now

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.860 align:middle line:84%
and the concentration
of activity.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.340 align:middle line:10%
So if there's a particular
area that there's

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.203 align:middle line:10%
a huge amount of
synchronization and activity,

00:58:32.203 --> 00:58:33.370 align:middle line:10%
then you'll see it light up.

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're
seeing a lot of activity

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.350 align:middle line:84%
there in the frontal and
then parietal occipital.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:39.308 align:middle line:90%
So parietal occipital--

00:58:39.308 --> 00:58:40.558 align:middle line:90%
>> We have them watching this.

00:58:40.558 --> 00:58:42.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so we can look
at facial expressions.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.150 align:middle line:84%
So we can tell if you're
blinking, you're winking,

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:47.610 align:middle line:84%
looking left and right,
furrowing your eyebrows,

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:51.420 align:middle line:84%
raising them in surprise,
smiling, clenching your teeth

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:52.680 align:middle line:90%
because you might be nervous.

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:55.470 align:middle line:84%

can detect very, very easily.

researching, and study,

sapiens, we found

the bones all over the

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:11.008 align:middle line:90%
were much smarter than us.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't think they were dumber.

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.562 align:middle line:90%
I think they were smarter.

01:00:13.562 --> 01:00:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
technologically smarter,

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:17.400 align:middle line:90%
I think spiritually smarter.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They probably didn't even have
to speak with their mouth.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.463 align:middle line:84%
They probably had
telekinesis, telepathy.

01:00:22.463 --> 01:00:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They were in tune
with the planet.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
They could receive and
send information directly

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.420 align:middle line:90%
from the earth itself.

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.720 align:middle line:84%
They were in resonant frequency
with everything in nature.

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And like I said, we're inside--

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're inside of
a conscious entity, which we're

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
calling the universal
consciousness,

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:40.800 align:middle line:84%
some call it God, some
call it divine Sophia--

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.290 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call
it, I believe that this

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:44.490 align:middle line:90%
is what we're inside of.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And the mechanism
used to generate

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of
the third dimension

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
is a hologram, just like your
brain projects its own hologram

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.390 align:middle line:84%
so that you can maneuver
through the third dimension.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
A scientist observing an
atom is actually a group

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.372 align:middle line:90%
of atoms observing itself.

01:00:58.372 --> 01:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're
doing here, right?

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a compilation
of atoms that

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
existed since the
beginning of what

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
we call "third
dimensional time,"

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.395 align:middle line:84%
and it's been regrouped
into this avatar format.

01:01:13.395 --> 01:01:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Before it could have been--

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I could have been a piece
of a rock, piece of a star,

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.300 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.520 align:middle line:90%
But we just keep reformatting.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And the beautiful
thing about these atoms

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
that are in my body that
make up this avatar body,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.980 align:middle line:90%
they have memory.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Memory can be written directly
onto each individual atom

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:30.940 align:middle line:90%
now in science laboratories.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.440 align:middle line:84%
This is something
they're doing now.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:90%
So DNA?

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now, we're writing on atoms.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Atoms store data.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So if atoms store data,
imagine how much information

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.700 align:middle line:90%
is in your body right now.

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.010 align:middle line:84%
The history of the entire
universe is inside of you.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we tell people
that the power's in you,

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we really mean the
power's in you.

01:01:49.110 --> 01:01:51.480 align:middle line:84%
We talked a little
bit about DNA storage.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.250 align:middle line:84%
This is an old clip
that I used to use.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.490 align:middle line:90%
It's 5.5 petabytes.

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
They've got it up
to 433 petabytes

01:01:56.550 --> 01:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%
now of data on one gram.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They found out that
a human body can

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
store 13.5 billion years
of data, which, ironically,

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.580 align:middle line:90%
is the age of the universe.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So the universe, literally,
is inside of you.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:11.460 align:middle line:84%
This is why human
beings are some

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
of the most coveted entities
in the universe because

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of our special capability,
our storage capacity,

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.870 align:middle line:84%
our diversity, all the things
that make up who we are,

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
and we still haven't
truly realized

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.400 align:middle line:90%
our true full potential yet.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The reason why they continue to
put out their boot on our necks

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
is because if we ever
realized-- phew, oh my goodness.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:37.355 align:middle line:90%
We would be creating universes.

01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
we truly are.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.108 align:middle line:90%
We'd create universes.

01:02:40.108 --> 01:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And we're working on that
now, believe it or not.

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.108 align:middle line:84%
People are trying to
create their own universes

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
in science laboratories
through technology.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%
But we literally have the
power to be divine creators.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Because the divine
source and the spark

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is inside of every single
atom inside of our bodies.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.793 align:middle line:90%
That is about DNA computing.

01:02:58.793 --> 01:03:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I just want to read
this one real quick.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.252 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I have to
skip a couple of these

01:03:02.252 --> 01:03:03.610 align:middle line:90%
because you know how it is.

01:03:03.610 --> 01:03:08.320 align:middle line:10%
"Described in the Journal of
Nature, researchers working

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:10.990 align:middle line:10%
at an IBM research
facility in California

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:14.440 align:middle line:10%
found that when the
holmium atoms were placed

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.960 align:middle line:10%
on a special surface
made of magnesium oxide,

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.580 align:middle line:10%
they naturally
oriented themselves

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.010 align:middle line:10%
with a magnetic north
and a magnetic south.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:22.460 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Because that's how you
get zeros and ones.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered
that depending

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:28.900 align:middle line:84%
on the magnetic field that
they interact with an atom,

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
they can get it to
spin up or spin down.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:33.910 align:middle line:84%
A spin up would be a 0, a
spin down would be a one.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.822 align:middle line:84%
And by doing zeros and ones,
I can create digital code,

01:03:36.822 --> 01:03:39.280 align:middle line:84%
which is what's making this
computer show you on the screen

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.080 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The internet runs
on zeroes and ones.

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:44.127 align:middle line:90%
Your GPSs runs on--

01:03:44.127 --> 01:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
everything's on zeroes and ones.

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
All your TV shows are
on zeros and ones.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Everything is zeros and ones,
digital bits of information.

01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, Professor
James S. Gates, professor

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
in supersymmetry and
theoretical physics

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:59.590 align:middle line:84%
discovered that spacetime,
the ether of spacetime,

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
runs off of something
called Adinkra codes,

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
which were discovered by the
Dogon tribe in Mali Africa

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:07.168 align:middle line:84%
thousands and thousands of years
ago and depicted in artwork.

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
When you take them and turn
them into three-dimensional

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
structures, you discover that
their error-correcting codes.

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:15.098 align:middle line:84%
The same exact codes that
Professor Gates discovered

01:04:15.098 --> 01:04:17.140 align:middle line:84%
are the same ones that
run search engine browsers

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.000 align:middle line:90%
and websites.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So the ether of spacetime
that we're living in

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
runs off of the same
technology or same programming

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
code that runs websites
and search engines.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:29.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're living
in, guys, a program.

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.150 align:middle line:90%
We're living in a program.

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So brain scans can reveal
your conscious decisions

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
seven seconds before you decide.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people have heard me
talk about this years ago.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.195 align:middle line:84%
So they took some people,
put them in a room,

01:04:41.195 --> 01:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and then they put
the cap on their head

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to read the light waves
coming out of their skulls.

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And they were showing images
10 seconds apart, right?

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And so they would
show a bed of roses.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
10 seconds later, they'd
show a woman hugging a baby.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
10 seconds later,
somebody getting stabbed.

01:04:57.610 --> 01:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
10 seconds later,
maybe somebody getting

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:03.208 align:middle line:84%
run over by a car, just horrific
scenes and serene scenes.

01:05:03.208 --> 01:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And then what they were trying
to do was discover-- map

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the human brain, what
the brain lights up like,

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
what it looks like lit up for
specific feelings and emotions,

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.060 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
What started happening
was up to seven seconds

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.820 align:middle line:84%
before the next
image even showed up,

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
the brain was transmitting
to the computer

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:23.085 align:middle line:84%
what the next image was going
to be-- horrific or serene.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So then they said,
wait a minute.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.660 align:middle line:90%
This was an accident.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.310 align:middle line:84%
We weren't even
looking for this.

01:05:27.310 --> 01:05:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And they started doing it over
and over again and duplicating

01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
this experiment and found
that it happens-- no matter

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
how many times
you do it, there's

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
always this build-up
of advanced knowledge

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
before the thing
actually happens.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:40.510 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.010 align:middle line:90%
We're not living in real time.

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:46.000 align:middle line:84%
We're living in the third
dimension, the third density.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It takes time for the
conscious stream of information

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
to funnel through
multiple dimensions

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
because we're multidimensional
beings until it hits

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the third dimension
avatar body and it

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
gets deciphered and discerned
into what's going on.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.710 align:middle line:90%
There's a delay process in that.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
That's like if I turn on a
DirectTV satellite on one TV

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.913 align:middle line:84%
and I put on cable on
the other, the cable

01:06:06.913 --> 01:06:08.080 align:middle line:90%
is going to be more current.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.538 align:middle line:84%
The DirectTV is
going to be delayed

01:06:09.538 --> 01:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
because the signal has to go
to space and then come back.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what that is.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.695 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's happening.

01:06:14.695 --> 01:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
Right now, you're not
seeing me in real time.

01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:18.050 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at me as I was.

01:06:18.050 --> 01:06:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes time for a
photon to bounce off of me,

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
hit your retina, go to the back
your brain, get deciphered,

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
project an image of
what I look like.

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:29.365 align:middle line:84%
But by the time that
happens, I've already moved.

01:06:29.365 --> 01:06:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So you're not seeing me
in real time, either.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.162 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is in real time.

01:06:33.162 --> 01:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is where
discernment is extremely

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:35.830 align:middle line:90%
important in your life.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Because you need to be able
to discern future events

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
before they happen at
the cusp that things

01:06:40.270 --> 01:06:41.470 align:middle line:84%
are getting ready to
happen so that you

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
can make the adjustments and
navigate through this matrix.

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:45.010 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
going to consistently

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:47.218 align:middle line:84%
get caught up, and caught
up, and caught up in things

01:06:47.218 --> 01:06:49.128 align:middle line:84%
and get blindsided
over and over again

01:06:49.128 --> 01:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and not be able to detect things
before they actually happen.

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get ahead
of that time wave.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about the fact
that light is conscious.

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.408 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the fact
that electrons are conscious.

01:06:59.408 --> 01:07:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything is really conscious.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.242 align:middle line:90%
Your body is made of light.

01:07:02.242 --> 01:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk a
little bit about the merkaba

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.158 align:middle line:84%
now that we have the
basic understanding.

01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:09.910 align:middle line:84%
The merkaba, spelled
"merkabah" translates literally

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
into, "light, spirit, body."

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.050 align:middle line:84%
The merkaba symbol
is a shape made

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
from two intersecting
tetrahedrons that

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
spin in opposite directions,
socounter rotating

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
directions, creating a
three-dimensional energy field.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
This is around the human body.

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is literally
a vehicle of ascension.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
There are gurus that can
travel the universe in these,

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.742 align:middle line:84%
including Thoth
the Atlantean could

01:07:33.742 --> 01:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
travel throughout the universe
using one of these merkabas.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Thoth went to many planets.

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, I traveled
to many worlds

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:43.770 align:middle line:84%
watching civilizations
rise and fall

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:46.840 align:middle line:90%
using his merkaba light vessel.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's a counterrotating
tetrahedron

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.080 align:middle line:90%
is what you're looking at here.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So these two triangles
or these two pyramids,

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and that basic shape around
the outer edge of the body

01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:59.740 align:middle line:84%
is like your tourist
energy field.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And those points intersect
with the most powerful points

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
of your energy field,
the ka and the ba,

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.140 align:middle line:84%
those are the
super-hyperactive energy points

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:09.940 align:middle line:90%

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:18.479 align:middle line:84%
Well, every single

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:44.310 align:middle line:90%

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.689 align:middle line:84%

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.900 align:middle line:90%

not a mythical person.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:22.928 align:middle line:84%
A real person really
did exist and really

01:10:22.928 --> 01:10:25.920 align:middle line:84%
had these capabilities
through understanding

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.160 align:middle line:90%
how the body works.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's get into a little
bit more about this.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
So now the merkaba
is fundamentally

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.840 align:middle line:90%
based off of the seed of life.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the fundamental basis.

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:37.830 align:middle line:90%
This is where it begins.

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
This seed of life
structure, which

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is six circles
with a seventh one,

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
so you have one circle in the
middle with six circles round.

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:46.830 align:middle line:90%
That creates the seed of life.

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is a really
important structure

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:52.050 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
fundamental basis of reality.

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of
fact, this structure

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
is in the base of your spine
right now from the time

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
that you went through mitosis
and generated these first seven

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:04.320 align:middle line:90%
cells, they're still there.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
divided out from there,

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:10.000 align:middle line:84%
but this fundamental basis of
these cells are still there.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.550 align:middle line:90%
This is a cross-section of DNA.

01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.060 align:middle line:90%
So as above, so below.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
No matter how low you go, how
deep you go into this realm,

01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:21.290 align:middle line:84%
you're going to discover
the similarities

01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a fractal,
holographic universe.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:27.122 align:middle line:84%
And in a hologram, if you
take a small piece out,

01:11:27.122 --> 01:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that smallest piece
you took out is

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:31.140 align:middle line:84%
going to have a picture of
the entire hologram in it.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.227 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you lose is a
little bit of resolution, OK?

01:11:34.227 --> 01:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
This is important, though.

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.580 align:middle line:90%
This is part of the merkaba.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.885 align:middle line:84%
This is cell division
through mitosis.

01:11:39.885 --> 01:11:42.010 align:middle line:10%
As you can see, how we all
go to the flower of life

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.430 align:middle line:10%
and developed life
forms from this.

So the first question is,
who is this guy Metatron?

01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Who is this being
known as Metatron?

01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Where'd he come from?

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
If you investigate,
you find that metatron

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
was an arc angel who is
mentioned in Islamic, Judaic,

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
and Christian mythologies,
medieval mythologies.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.710 align:middle line:10%
He was considered to
be the scribe of God.

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
So this would make
the archangel Metatron

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of the ancient
Egyptian scribe of the gods

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.300 align:middle line:90%
known as Thoth, Hermes.

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.360 align:middle line:10%
Now according to
legend, a scribe of God

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.920 align:middle line:10%
would understand
the root principles

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.590 align:middle line:10%
of creation, which are
almost always associated

01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:21.150 align:middle line:10%
with sacred geometry.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the archangel metatron
is many times pictured with

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.420 align:middle line:90%
or holding a cube.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit about
Metatron, the guy Metatron.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But the graphic known
as Metatron's cube

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
didn't show up till later when
a medieval Italian mathematician

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
named Leonardo
Pisano discovered it.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So the next question is,
why and how did Leonardo

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
come to call this particular
graphic Metatron's cube?

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Beautifully illustrates-- and
so Metatron's cube create.

01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:05.820 align:middle line:10%
It's very easy to get
a perfect blueprint

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:11.010 align:middle line:10%
of both the dodecahedron
and the icosahedron.

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.330 align:middle line:90%
This is really significant.

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And this makes
Metatron's cube actually

01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:17.085 align:middle line:90%
work as a perfect blueprint.

01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:18.100 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.142 align:middle line:84%
>> What I wanted to show
you here is you see that

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
dodecahedron there
over his head?

01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Inside of Metatron's
cube, you get this form

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.190 align:middle line:90%
called vector equilibrium.

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:33.448 align:middle line:84%
And so the vector equilibrium is
a source of unparalleled power.

01:15:33.448 --> 01:15:35.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy
source for the medieval.

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what I was
trying to get to,

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
but I'm running out of time.

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So inside the merkaba
is this particular form.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And this form is literally the
source for zero point energy,

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
not only zero point energy
where we can literally power

01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
everything without
plugging anything in,

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
but also it's the form
of spiritual energy

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that can transmit your body
to anywhere in the galaxy,

01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:59.200 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the universe.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Through Metatron's Cube,
through this technology,

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
tapping into this
vector equilibrium,

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.222 align:middle line:84%
you can literally create portals
and wormholes in spacetime

01:16:09.222 --> 01:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
according to some of
these ancient sages,

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
like Thoth the Atlantean,
where he talked

01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.398 align:middle line:84%
about going through
the [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:14.398 --> 01:16:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and opening up these portals,
and going through these gates,

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.925 align:middle line:84%
the gates that they're
talking about in a lot

01:16:18.925 --> 01:16:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of the religious
texts aren't pearly

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.980 align:middle line:84%
gates to go into this
golden-plated heaven thing.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.302 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
gates to go to gates.

01:16:26.302 --> 01:16:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Star gates is what
they're talking about.

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the ancient
texts where a lot of that stuff

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
came from, you'll find that
talking about star gates, which

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:35.080 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm talking about on
Monday, star gates and portals.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show star gates
and portals, not only on Earth

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
but also on other planets in
our solar system based off

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:44.810 align:middle line:84%
of official NASA images and
European Space Agency images.

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.133 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, we're
running out of this time,

01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:49.716 align:middle line:84%
but I really wanted
to get all the way

01:16:49.716 --> 01:16:51.093 align:middle line:90%
to the end of this thing.

01:16:51.093 --> 01:16:52.510 align:middle line:84%
But these are all
the same things.

01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So you have the torus energy
feel, the Shri Yantra,

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:57.130 align:middle line:90%
the merkaba, and the aura.

01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same thing.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
All of these are the
same exact energy fields.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.038 align:middle line:84%
And how do you get
into the merkaba?

01:17:03.038 --> 01:17:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to wrap it up
now, guys, because I know

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.200 align:middle line:90%
we're running out of time here.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
But to get into the merkaba, the
first thing that you have to do

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:13.150 align:middle line:90%
is you have to be--

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:14.770 align:middle line:90%
you have to eat right.

01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:16.270 align:middle line:90%
And this is important.

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Now some people don't
want to hear this.

01:17:18.890 --> 01:17:21.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you're talking about
creating an energetic body,

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.520 align:middle line:90%
it requires energetic foods.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.268 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm not saying you
need to be a vegan and all

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:27.310 align:middle line:90%
this other kind of stuff.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:28.768 align:middle line:84%
What I'm saying is
if you're trying

01:17:28.768 --> 01:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to focus on merkaba meditation,
which there's a merkaba

01:17:31.210 --> 01:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
meditation that you
can just look up,

01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
you can just go to Google and
type in "merkaba meditation."

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:36.790 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of them
that will pop up.

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:38.110 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
4biddenknowledge.com,

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.800 align:middle line:90%
with the number four.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.592 align:middle line:84%
There's a merkaba
meditation on my website.

01:17:40.592 --> 01:17:41.877 align:middle line:90%
You can watch it for free.

01:17:41.877 --> 01:17:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get a lot of
information there as well.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.377 align:middle line:84%
But eating right
is very important

01:17:45.377 --> 01:17:47.293 align:middle line:84%
because you have to eat
energetic foods, which

01:17:47.293 --> 01:17:48.410 align:middle line:90%
means a plant-based diet.

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:50.952 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in the process of
working on merkaba meditation,

01:17:50.952 --> 01:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
focus on a plant-based
diet for that time period.

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying
you've got to wipe it

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
out of your body forever,
meats or whatever,

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
but for that time period,
focus on energetic foods.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Focus then also on
unconditional love.

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:05.800 align:middle line:84%
In order to get into
a merkaba meditation,

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.195 align:middle line:84%
you need to be in a mindset
of unconditional love.

01:18:08.195 --> 01:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Because unless you're in a
mindset of unconditional love,

01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
you're not at the
right frequency.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
The 528 Hertz love
frequency is the frequency

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that will give you the
capability of getting

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:21.520 align:middle line:84%
into the right mind
state in the meditation

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.172 align:middle line:90%
to then see the merkaba.

01:18:23.172 --> 01:18:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
you'll see this video

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.252 align:middle line:84%
on my website that's going
to show you the meditation.

01:18:27.252 --> 01:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And during the process
of the meditation,

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
you're going to envision
yourself standing

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:31.780 align:middle line:90%
outside of the merkaba.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
part of you, you're

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
going to see from
another perspective.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see two
counter-rotating tetrahedron.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Once you get about 15
minutes into the meditation,

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:42.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
step inside of it.

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:44.578 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're going to
allow it to just take you.

01:18:44.578 --> 01:18:45.620 align:middle line:90%
And why will it take you?

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:48.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the frequency
in the video is at 936

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Hertz, which generates movement.

01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And that movement's
going to take you places.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.035 align:middle line:84%
And you just have
to let yourself

01:18:54.035 --> 01:18:55.810 align:middle line:90%
go and go with the meditation.

01:18:55.810 --> 01:18:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But now, you understand
why it works.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.638 align:middle line:84%
It's working because
everything is light,

01:19:00.638 --> 01:19:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and the consciousness is light.

01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:03.220 align:middle line:90%
Every thought is light.

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.428 align:middle line:84%
And those light waves
create the merkaba.

01:19:05.428 --> 01:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Those light waves
create the reality.

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:08.887 align:middle line:84%
Those light waves create
everything around us,

01:19:08.887 --> 01:19:10.810 align:middle line:84%
including this entire
universe, all right?

01:19:10.810 --> 01:19:12.197 align:middle line:90%
I'll be outside selling my book.

01:19:12.197 --> 01:19:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:14.680 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you guys' time.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.780 align:middle line:90%
