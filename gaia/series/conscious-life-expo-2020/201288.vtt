00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Billy Carson.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks for coming.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.405 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, thanks for coming
out and staying this late.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And thank you to
everybody that's

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.272 align:middle line:90%
been sharing their information.

00:00:18.272 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you shared, and
the few people sharing it

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:84%
on their social
media, thank you.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I came around the corner.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I saw the line.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, yeah.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.705 align:middle line:90%
And then it was for Bashar.

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:90%
I respect and I love that guy.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.609 align:middle line:90%
He's phenomenal.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:32.409 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to add channeling
to my repertoire now.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:84%
For the next 20 years,
I'll be researching that.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:90%
But no, it's all good.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm just happy for
the opportunity

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to even be here, and
talk to you guys,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and go over this information.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Tonight we're going to talk
about star gates and portals.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And some of you may have
seen a little bit of this

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.617 align:middle line:90%
before, as it may overlap.

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've seen some
of your faces before.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.230 align:middle line:84%
So there may be one or
two, maybe three things

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.727 align:middle line:84%
that you see that may overlap
something you saw before.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, there's a lot of
brand new content that you've

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
never seen before that
will be involved--

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
will be included in this
presentation on star gates

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:90%
and portals.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.822 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let's get this party started.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:17.774 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:17.774 --> 00:01:44.457 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:45.290 align:middle line:90%
That's my alter ego.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.415 align:middle line:90%
I always have to play that.

00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So today we're going to talk
about star gates and portals.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Cool topic.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.537 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go into
some science dealing

00:01:57.537 --> 00:01:59.745 align:middle line:84%
with the djed pillar ankh,
and what that's all about,

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:00.430 align:middle line:90%
and what it is.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.273 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may have
seen some of it before.

00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to talk
about the science.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of you who have
come to my lectures

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
know that I incorporate
a lot of science

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.740 align:middle line:90%
into the things that talk about.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is because
science is behind this stuff.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not magic.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Science is behind spirituality.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that
spirituality doesn't exist.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just that science, or
quantum physics and quantum

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.260 align:middle line:84%
mechanics explains
what's happening

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual realm
to a certain degree.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
There's some things that we
still just don't know yet.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're still all growing.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
We're babies.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning, just like
everybody else here

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:90%
is learning.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.268 align:middle line:84%
Matter of fact,
sometimes I go back

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and watch my own presentations
so I can learn from myself.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm dead serious.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of the things
that I go over,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and even I have to
hear it 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
10 times to even grasp another
level of understanding.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:90%
So I'm pretty excited about it.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I have
my book "Compendium

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Emerald Tablets."

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I have a few left if anybody
wants to buy one at the end.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:10%
There's only a few left.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:10%
This weekend was crazy.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:10%
I would walk around
with a few, and they'd

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:10%
be gone before I got
back to the elevator.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:10%
But it's still a bestseller
10 months in a row.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And now it's being
converted into three

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
different languages--

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
German, French, and Spanish.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And Amazon is now doing
all the fulfillment.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a great
deal, because I was just

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.357 align:middle line:90%
doing the fulfillment myself.

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
They let me keep the
same amount of revenue,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're fulfilling it.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.580 align:middle line:84%
That's how good the
book is to them in terms

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
of their process of moving it.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And they just asked
me to send 3,000 more.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So I guess they're
doing very well with it.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:90%
And I have 11 new books done.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
They're in editing right now.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:90%
11 more books.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, 11.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.850 align:middle line:10%
So the editor-- the publisher,
Winterwolf publishing,

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.127 align:middle line:10%
Laura Cantu was like, you can't
put 11 books out at one time.

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I was like, why not?

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
She was like, we
just can't do it.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.193 align:middle line:90%
It's not like music.

00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:55.810 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- so OK,
I'm going to release--

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.673 align:middle line:84%
my first one is going
to be coming out

00:03:57.673 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:90%
in about a month and a half.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Being Woke
Doesn't Mean Being Broke."

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's one, I think,
this whole community

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:90%
needs to read ASAP.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.848 align:middle line:90%


00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
around here talking

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
about manifesting,
and downloading,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and all this stuff, and you
can't manifest your light bill

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.503 align:middle line:84%
payment, then there's
something wrong.

00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:18.910 align:middle line:10%
You're not really operating
in the law of attraction.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%
You're not operating in power.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.878 align:middle line:84%
You're not operating
in any of the things

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:90%
you've been learning about.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.205 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot of people
won't listen to certain people.

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:90%
They look at the lifestyle.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
They see the debt.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.572 align:middle line:84%
They see the issues
and the problems.

00:04:29.572 --> 00:04:31.657 align:middle line:90%
And they go, I don't believe it.

00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:32.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to be believable.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And to be believable,
you've got to show--

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
you've got to be the light that
shows, and shines, and says,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.727 align:middle line:84%
hey, it doesn't mean you've
got to be a billionaire.

00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But are all your needs being
met in a timely fashion?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.590 align:middle line:90%
That's all we ask.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
When I need something
to be taken care of,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.632 align:middle line:90%
is it taken care of?

00:04:46.632 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Am I scrambling around
every single month

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.510 align:middle line:84%
trying to figure out how
I'm going to do this,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and how am I going to do that,
and how I'm going to pay this?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:84%
What if I want to go out and
help 1,000 people tomorrow?

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
It's in my heart to do it.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's in everybody's
heart to do it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.958 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have
the finances, guess what.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we live
in a matrix system

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
that operates on monetary
fake money, fiat money.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But you have to see
it not as fiat money.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Look at it as an
energy exchange.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
Shift the way you think about
it, until we get out of it.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Eventually we'll get out of that
system, but while we're in it,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
think of it as an
energy exchange system.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:84%
How can you exchange
your energy for this

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
to acquire that
to link it to you

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to do something else that
you're looking to accomplish?

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that and shift
your mindset, a lot of things

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:90%
will change for you.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:90%
But I'm a world traveler.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.912 align:middle line:84%
I've been around the
world many times.

00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm here over at the Great
Pyramid, which is actually

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.032 align:middle line:90%
one of the portals--

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
underneath the Great Pyramid.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing inside of
the King's Chamber there.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber
is an amazing place.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's got the speed light in
meters per second in the Grand

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:90%
Gallery.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.267 align:middle line:84%
The longitude of
the Grand Gallery

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
is the speed of light
by meters per second.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well, meters
per second just got-- meters--

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
the metric system just
got discovered, right?

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.340 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:90%
The metric system is ancient.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
They discovered it
in South America.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:84%
They discovered proto-Sumerian
tablets with cuneiform writing

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
on them, and little bowls with
cuneiform writing on them,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
and they had what?

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.285 align:middle line:90%
The metric system as well.

00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:13.410 align:middle line:90%
And that's well documented.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been--
this has been--

00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't even-- it's
been in the records

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.467 align:middle line:84%
so long that I can't
believe that people still

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
don't understand that the
metric system is not brand new.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Most likely the guy
who rediscovered it,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
he may have looked
up these tablets,

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's all
laid out right there.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.020 align:middle line:84%
And Wikipedia isn't my
greatest source of information,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.423 align:middle line:84%
but it's even on
Wikipedia, which

00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
they try to hide everything.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.245 align:middle line:90%
So it's crazy.

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And here I am here at the
Temple of Abydos, pointing up.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
About 50 meters above
me is this technology.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:10%
But the technology
isn't just here.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.022 align:middle line:10%
So some people
say, oh, it's been

00:06:45.022 --> 00:06:47.480 align:middle line:10%
debunked because they said they
recarved these hieroglyphs,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:10%
and they ended up
looking like technology.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.533 align:middle line:10%
Well, explain why it's the same
exact way all throughout Egypt.

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.450 align:middle line:10%
And some of the people
who go on my Egypt tour

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:10%
will see as we go and
look at these hieroglyphs,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.100 align:middle line:10%
that they're everywhere.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:90%
They're everywhere.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm at the top of Ollantaytambo.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:90%
This is in Peru.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
There's blocks up here that came
from another mountain, which

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to get them from
the top of one mountain

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.640 align:middle line:84%
and bring them over
to this mountain,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.070 align:middle line:84%
they could tell by the sediment
is just an amazing feat.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
How they did it,
nobody can tell.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But the homegrown
guides will tell you

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
that it was the gods that
brought the stones there.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
same story no matter

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:90%
where you go in the world.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They always blame
it on the gods.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.542 align:middle line:84%
The gods brought this
stuff here, you know?

00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the answer.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:90%
They never say that we did it.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
The only time you hear
something somebody

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
said that humans did it is on
the mainstream archeology stuff

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and the stuff on mainstream TV.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying-- I
saw one this morning.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They were walking one of
the Easter Island heads

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.167 align:middle line:90%
down this road.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, the Easter Islands
are not just heads.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:84%
That was a broken
Easter Island statue.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:84%
At Easter Island,
they have deep bodies

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
that go way down a few
meters underground.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're not walking that
thing with some simple ropes.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's just--

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is behind the
scenes pulling the strings

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
and make people put
this stuff on TV.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.090 align:middle line:90%
It's just really crazy.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But Machu Picchu is
an amazing place.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:10%
I've been there.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back again
and take a few people with me.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:90%
This is my guide here.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.833 align:middle line:84%
There's still gold behind
these giant stones right there.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The one I'm standing in front
of, there's gold back there.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
It's being guarded
by the military.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Ancient gold.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing this
stuff was still there.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Of course, dinosaurs
walked with man.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.127 align:middle line:10%
So you can see it's
got meat on its bones.

00:08:35.127 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they knew
what it looked like.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.140 align:middle line:10%
And these dinosaurs can be
found all over the world.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Gobekli Tepe now, one
of the oldest sites

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:10%
known to be kind of
partially dug out.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's about
13,000 years old,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
around the time of
the last ice age.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.745 align:middle line:84%
But you can find them
even in Lake Michigan.

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a stonehenge
underneath Lake Michigan

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered about
three or four years ago.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And in that stonehenge,
it has these pillars,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:84%
just like Gobekli Tepe,
just like Stonehenge

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:90%
in Amesbury, UK.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's got etched
and carved into it

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:90%
dinosaurs and mastodons.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's really an
amazing discovery.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Here I am at Akrotiri, Greece
on the island of Santorini.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.125 align:middle line:90%
And I was on this dig site.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It's about a four-mile
dig site, only about 10%

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:90%
uncovered so far.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:90%
A lot of technology there.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%
I did a huge article on that.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.340 align:middle line:84%
It's on 4biddenknowledge.com
and the blog page.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of photos.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see piping
that looks like PVC piping

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%
that we use right now today.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see stones that
are maybe 2 meters thick that

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
have a tiny little hole.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.590 align:middle line:84%
From one end, they go straight
through to the other side.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:42.720 align:middle line:84%
You can't do that
with a chip and bone.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And flushing toilets that work
from the second story on down

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and flush away even the
scent and the smell away

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:90%
from the house.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.243 align:middle line:90%
It sucks it out with suction.

00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think we
have that nowadays.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:84%
We need to reclaim
that technology.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But it's an amazing site.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And they claim that it's part of
the ancient Atlantean culture,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%
which is really amazing.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Here I am at
Teotihuacan in Mexico.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing on top of
the Pyramid of the Moon,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
which is actually
eight pyramids in one.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So this pyramid was built
by Thoth the Atlantean.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was dedicated
to his wife.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:90%
And his wife was a human.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And so it's eight pyramids
stacked on top of each other

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.200 align:middle line:90%
to make one pyramid.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the highest
level you can get to.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:84%
There's one more level
above it, but they

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.952 align:middle line:84%
don't let you get
to that level, only

00:10:26.952 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
to this where I'm at,
just one level below.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.340 align:middle line:10%
And behind me is the
Pyramid of the Sun.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid of the
Sun is exactly 50%

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
the height of the
Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And the base is
exactly the same.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:10%
The alignment of
the three pyramids

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.320 align:middle line:10%
that are here in this grid
are the same alignment

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.990 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramids of Giza,
which align with the Orion star

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:10%
cluster.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And here I am Kukulcan,
the Pyramid of Kukulcan

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and Chichen Itza in
the Yucatan Peninsula.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:90%
So we'll get this thing started.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.165 align:middle line:84%
This is a little
video that I did.

00:10:58.165 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm walking through a portal.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:10%
This is actually a music
video that was on MTV,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.330 align:middle line:10%
just the beginning clip of it.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:10%
The song is called into
"Anunnaki" by Donny Arcade.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.310 align:middle line:10%
This is a classic.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:10%
This is how I envisioned
it back in the day.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:10%
You just walk right
through a portal

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.402 align:middle line:10%
and get to your destination.

00:11:36.402 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty cool.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can watch the
whole video on YouTube.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.590 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:84%
"Anunnaki" by Donny Arcade,
D-O-N-N-Y, Donny Arcade.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
DNA for a second.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So now when I started
researching these portals

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and star gates, I started
finding something very similar

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:84%
between all of ancient
records in the history

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and the hearsay
about them and some

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous information
about the portals.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's that only
specific people were

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:14.930 align:middle line:84%
able to walk
through the portals.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just like anybody can
just walk through the portal.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:90%
And it had a lot to do with DNA.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot to do with
frequency, atomic structure,

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.300 align:middle line:90%
and keys, and codes.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we're
getting ready to get into.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
What is the atomic
structure about?

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
What is the DNA about?

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.140 align:middle line:90%
What are the keys and codes?

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So yesterday in my
talk, or Saturday,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I think it was, in my talk,
we talked a little bit

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
about the storage
capability of DNA,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
how DNA stores memories
and information.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So I showed one particular
video where these scientists

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
replicated their e-book 80
billion times on 1 gram of DNA.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:84%
DNA stores digital
bits of zeros and ones,

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
data, hard-- the
same data that's

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
on this computer that makes
this show up on the screen

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
is the same exact data
that your DNA can store.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It can upload and download, not
only through a hard connection,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:90%
but also wirelessly as well.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is something similar.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what's going on
here at the Wyss Institute,

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
because they actually
are working with Harvard,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and have come up with a DNA
hard drive, one of the very

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.137 align:middle line:90%
first DNA hard drives.

00:13:13.137 --> 00:13:15.470 align:middle line:84%
This is important to understand
the science behind this,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
because when we get into
the djed pillar ankh,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.392 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
what I'm talking about.

00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:22.096 align:middle line:84%
It's directly linked to how
DNA can store information.

00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>> So this research is about
alternative ways of storing

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:35.950 align:middle line:10%
data, digital data for
archival purposes with DNA.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The initial thought was I
don't care what I'm building,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:10%
so why don't we just build
"Moby Dick" or something?

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.380 align:middle line:10%
I'll just encode it into DNA.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:10%
We'll just build
that, because I don't

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.895 align:middle line:10%
want to worry about the
design at this point in time.

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Sriram and I debated
what we should encode,

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.525 align:middle line:10%
what would nicely represent
the digital universe.

00:13:53.525 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And we wanted something
that represents

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:10%
sort of modern digital.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:10%
So we used an HTML
version of a book

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:10%
that I wrote recently
called "Regenesis."

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:10%
The HTML form, let's
say the web form,

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:10%
includes images, digital images.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.690 align:middle line:10%
It includes JavaScript,
programming language

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.880 align:middle line:10%
that actually does--
performs something

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:10%
interactively with a person.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And so we encoded that
into zeros and ones,

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:10%
and then into DNA.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:10%
>> We started thinking about--

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:10%
based on some prior
work, thinking about DNA

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:10%
as a source of information
storage, because, one,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.610 align:middle line:10%
it is very long-lasting.

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.010 align:middle line:10%
You can recover DNA
over thousands of years.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:10%
And second, it's a very dense
storage information source.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.425 align:middle line:10%
>> Most non-DNA method
store on a plane.

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:48.925 align:middle line:10%
Well, DNA can be
stored in a volume.

00:14:48.925 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:10%


00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:10%
The density is remarkably high,
as little as one bit per base,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.050 align:middle line:10%
one base per cubic nanometer.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.140 align:middle line:10%
And so we can store on the order
of almost a zettabyte in a gram

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:10%
of DNA, a milliliter of volume.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:10%
>> The theoretical density of
DNA is that you could store

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:10%
the total world information,
which is 1.8 zettabytes,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.900 align:middle line:10%
at least in 2011, in
about four grams of DNA.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:10%
>> And it leverages rapidly
improving next generation

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.780 align:middle line:10%
reading and writing of DNA.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So the important thing about
this is what is stopping us

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
right now from being successful
with teleportation and all

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
these other technologies that
we want to be able to do?

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation is when you
take somebody from point A,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.210 align:middle line:84%
and you literally take
their atoms apart,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and you beam the atoms
to another location,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
and reassemble those atoms
in the same exact order.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So you have a person, like,
"Beam me up, Scotty" on "Star

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Trek."

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biggest
problem with that

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
is not that we don't
know how to do it.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:90%
We know how to do teleportation.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
We've done teleportation
now for at least 10 years.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:84%
We've been teleporting
individual particles.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we actually are able
to teleport molecules.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.595 align:middle line:84%
So we're teleporting-- I think,
it was maybe five months ago

00:16:07.595 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:84%
we teleported some
molecules from Earth

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
to the ISS, the
International Space Station.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a big feat.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But the amount of memory
it takes is significant.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Now with DNA hard
drives, that's all gone,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
because one human body can store
13.5 billion years of data,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:90%
the same age as the universe.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
So all that storage
capacity is in your body.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
So the human body truly
is a biological avatar

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that is already set up as
a gigantic USB hard drive,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
literally.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, you could
upload and download information

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.710 align:middle line:90%
into the body.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
So now the human body
avatar can be integrated

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.750 align:middle line:90%
into other technologies.

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes a piece of the
technology it's linking with,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:90%
almost like a module.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So instead of having to
have a portable hard drive

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
to go and connect to
this star gate somewhere,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
these ancients were
utilizing the hard drive

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
in their bodies to
be able to upload

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
and download themselves
from place to place.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And the storage
capacity is immense.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.720 align:middle line:84%
One drop on the tip of your
finger is 433 petabytes.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.180 align:middle line:84%
That's an enormous
amount of data.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
At that rate, a hard drive
the size of your cell phone

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
could store all the information
in this entire solar system.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Forget the Earth.

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.440 align:middle line:84%
The solar system can be stored
in your phone, everything.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing the amount
of storage capacity.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And that's in your body.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And along with that, are
your epigenetic memories.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So you have about 15 to 18
years of epigenetic memories

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And that is the memories
from your ancestors.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you explain the
Akashic record phenomena with

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:90%
memory stored in a locality?

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.605 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Akashic records
is real, first of all.

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:52.405 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
He's asking about
the Akashic records.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So what I talked about
Saturday, the fact

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that every single thought that
you think, including right now

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.690 align:middle line:84%
as we're sitting
here, it gets sent

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
through the skull in the form of
an electromagnetic wave, which

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.010 align:middle line:90%
is a wave of light.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So every thought you
think is a light wave.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Those light waves
move on into spacetime

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.133 align:middle line:84%
permanently forever
through eternity.

00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
So everything that ever-- every
thought that ever existed,

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.650 align:middle line:84%
every idea, every
concept that ever existed

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.480 align:middle line:90%
is already in spacetime.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And most likely,
you don't really

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:84%
get an original idea
most of the time.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Probably 90% of the
time you download

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.010 align:middle line:90%
ideas that already exist.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So the Akashic records
are the storage medium

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in this etheric grid, that
store all this light data,

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
this electromagnetic wave data.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And just like before he
died, Stephen Hawking,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
he reversed his original
theory on black holes,

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:84%
thinking that black
holes were eternal,

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and that anything that
fell in was destroyed.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Later on before he died, he
realized that black holes

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:90%
were not eternal.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They radiate out, and
dissipate after trillions

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of years, sometimes billions
of years, depending on size.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But that anything that goes into
the black hole, the information

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:90%
is never lost.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.160 align:middle line:84%
It's transferred to
the event horizon,

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and stored there
permanently as data.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
So we go back to the same
old thing, the second law

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.175 align:middle line:90%
of thermodynamics.

00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So energy and information
can't be destroyed.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.430 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
all information

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is already contained
in spacetime,

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
which means the Akashic
records are real,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:84%
which means that the
person that taps into them

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is tapping into the
etheric grid, this grid

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're all connected
to and plugged into that

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
has all the data,
all the information.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.910 align:middle line:84%
That is really the thing
that connects all of us.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And the illusion of separation
that we have because we've

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.835 align:middle line:84%
coalesced into this avatar
body under a slower vibration

00:19:38.835 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:90%
is really just an illusion.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
We're really still all one.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:90%
We're all one entity.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.200 align:middle line:84%
We're just-- like if you took
this flat panel here, and just

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.063 align:middle line:84%
imagined little things popping
up out of it, those are us.

00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those is
a different person,

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.473 align:middle line:84%
but we're still part of
this same flat panel.

00:19:53.473 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
That's just all it is.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
another version of me.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just another
version of you.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:84%
The Ancients have a term,
"in lak'ech ala k'in."

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:90%
And I am just another you.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.725 align:middle line:90%
That's really what it means.

00:20:05.725 --> 00:20:07.350 align:middle line:84%
The Ancients knew
about all this stuff.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're just now
just trying to catch up.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.690 align:middle line:90%
We're holding on for dear life.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:90%
We're really trying to catch up.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:10%
I remember a few years
ago where the storage

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:10%
medium on one gram of DNA was
5.5 petabits, 700 terabytes.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.290 align:middle line:10%
Now they've upped
it to 433 petabytes.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:10%
We're moving fast.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:10%
Now Microsoft last year created
the first DNA hard drive.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
So now everything is going
to take off like lightning.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.113 align:middle line:84%
And then now we're going to have
the quantum computers, which

00:20:36.113 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
today, because that's also

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.750 align:middle line:84%
very important for star gates,
the ability to have qubits.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And what a qubit is, and how
it works, and why it works,

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and how it integrates
into star gates.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
This is really technology.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:84%
This star gate stuff is
not just like hocus pocus,

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
somebody is waving a wand,
and this thing opens up.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It's real, hardcore, advanced,
super advanced technology.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's something that we're
trying to acquire ourselves

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
right now, us being the
military industrial complex.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.910 align:middle line:10%
>> We are producing a lot
more data than we're capable

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:10%
of storing today.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:10%
We think that to put
a dent on the problem,

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:10%
we need a radical new solution.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:10%
And so we're looking at
DNA as one such solution.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:10%
>> And one of the reasons that
we're using DNA is its density

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:10%
is orders of magnitude higher
than anything that exists

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:10%
today, its reliability
and resiliency,

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:10%
and then it has relevancy.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:10%
We think that as long as
there are humans alive,

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.710 align:middle line:10%
we'll care about
reading our own DNA.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.650 align:middle line:10%
And that means that
we'll have a storage

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:10%
format that will be with us
that will always be relevant.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:10%
>> We have been working on
using DNA for data storage

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:10%
for several years now.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:10%
But the process so far has
been incredibly manual.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:10%
Literally, people moving around
with pipettes in their hands.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.330 align:middle line:10%
So the only way we're going to
make DNA data storage scale up

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.812 align:middle line:10%
to be usable and go mainstream
is by automating it.

00:21:54.812 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:10%
And what we've done with this,
with the project that you're

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:10%
going to learn more
about now is showing

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:02.700 align:middle line:10%
that it's possible to automate
the entire process from bits

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:10%
to molecules and back to bits.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.280 align:middle line:10%
>> The writing process takes
your data file and encodes

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:16.500 align:middle line:10%
those ones and zeros into
A's, C's, T's, and G's.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.730 align:middle line:10%
Those A's, C's, T's,
and G's are actually

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.230 align:middle line:10%
what gets sent to
the device itself.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.688 align:middle line:10%
>> You're looking at the matrix
right now, the real matrix.

00:22:22.688 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Every base that flows into a
column incorporates itself onto

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:10%
a strand of DNA.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.390 align:middle line:10%
So once all the DNA bases
have been incorporated

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:10%
into the strands on
the column, the strands

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:10%
need to be removed
from the column.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:10%
So we pump a chemical
mixture into the column,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:10%
which frees them from
their solid support,

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:10%
and pushes them into a
liquid storage bottle.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:10%
So once we decide to read
the data off the DNA,

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:10%
the read master mix is applied
to the DNA storage pool.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:10%
That master mix prepares
the DNA to be read.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Now that the DNA is
readable, it gets

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.820 align:middle line:10%
pumped into the read device,
where it gets translated

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:10%
into A's, C's, T's, and
G's, sequences the computer

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:10%
can understand.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.820 align:middle line:10%
Those sequences then get decoded
back into ones and zeros.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>> And I think the other thing
that's interesting to realize

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.990 align:middle line:10%
about this result, too, is that
this might be pointing to a new

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.017 align:middle line:10%
kind of computer system that
has an electronic component

00:23:25.017 --> 00:23:26.100 align:middle line:10%
and a molecular component.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:10%
So you use molecules for
what they're good at,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.860 align:middle line:10%
use electronics for
what they are good at,

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:10%
and then you integrate them
and show that is actually

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:10%
possible to build
a system that has

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:10%
dry electronics, wet
molecules, and they together

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:10%
do something amazing.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.983 align:middle line:84%
>> The next level
is the atomic level.

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is important when
you're talking about star gates

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:90%
and portals.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:10%
So scientists discovered
that they can now

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:10%
write data directly onto
each individual atom.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So as you know, we have
billions of atoms that

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.330 align:middle line:90%
make up the human body avatar.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.472 align:middle line:84%
Imagine writing data onto
each individual atom.

00:24:01.472 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking
about these beings

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
being extremely
advanced, and being

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:84%
able to live all these
years, and knowing

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
all this information,
imagine if you

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
were able to transmit
information directly

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:90%
onto each atom in your body.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're walking around with
100 trillion zettabytes of data

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that you have access
to at any given time,

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:90%
your own internal internet.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So when anybody
asks you a question,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.030 align:middle line:84%
the answer is
instantaneously given,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.840 align:middle line:84%
because pretty much
uploading it from your atoms

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:84%
directly into your conscious
and spitting it out.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:35.400 align:middle line:90%
You would appear to be a god.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.647 align:middle line:84%
You're going to appear
to be an alpha and omega.

00:24:39.647 --> 00:24:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I know everything,
and I'm everywhere.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.030 align:middle line:90%
And I know it.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.715 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing I can't answer.

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based
on technology.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And this type of technology
is happening already.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:90%
We're already now with a--

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the experiment mimics the way
a magnetic disk of a hard drive

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:53.670 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
The tiny magnets on those
disks point either up or down.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And the orientation
conveys binary information.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they do
is they use a magnetic field

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:90%
on an atom.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And when they apply a
magnetic field to it,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.180 align:middle line:84%
they get the atom to
spin up or spin down.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.590 align:middle line:84%
How do you create
zeros and ones?

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.577 align:middle line:90%
Spin up, and spin down.

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you get a
spin up, it's a one.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:90%
A spin down is a zero.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.870 align:middle line:90%
So you spin down, down, down.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:90%
That's 0, 0, 0.

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:90%
Up, up, up is 1, 1, 1.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:84%
Now between that you
can make computer code.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And a computer code can be
transferred into a computer

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and read just like
you're reading a book.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And now you have software
programming coming out

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:90%
of atoms.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So you can write data
directly onto atoms

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
by this method of
magnetism with a needle

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.300 align:middle line:84%
that's smaller than the
width of the atom itself.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you can write data
onto an atom and store it there.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Amazing stuff.

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget
one important piece

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.840 align:middle line:84%
that was said by one of the
scientists in a previous video.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.960 align:middle line:84%
He said that DNA can be
accessible for millions

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.070 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
That's important when we
get further down into this.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
quantum computing,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.670 align:middle line:84%
because these star gates
and portals, in my opinion,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.700 align:middle line:84%
run off of some type of
quantum-based computer.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Bits, which can be
either zero or one.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, in contrast, a quantum
computer uses quantum bits,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.560 align:middle line:10%
or qubits.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And they can be both zero
and one at the same time.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.710 align:middle line:10%
And it is this that
gives a quantum computer

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.840 align:middle line:10%
its superior computing power.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.580 align:middle line:10%
There are a number
of physical objects

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:10%
that can be used as a qubit--

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.315 align:middle line:10%
a single photon, a
nucleus, or an electron.

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:10%
I met up with
researchers who are

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:10%
using the outermost electron
in phosphorus as a qubit.

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.880 align:middle line:10%
But how does that work?

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, all electrons
have magnetic fields.

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:10%
So they're basically
like tiny bar magnets.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And this property
is called spin.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.630 align:middle line:10%
If you place them
in a magnetic field,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.780 align:middle line:10%
they will align with that
field, just like a compass

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.870 align:middle line:10%
needle lines up with the
magnetic field of the Earth.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is the
lowest energy state.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:10%
So you could call
it the zero state,

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.860 align:middle line:10%
or we call it for the
electron spin down.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:10%
Now, you can put it in a
one state or a spin up,

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:10%
but that takes some energy.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.953 align:middle line:10%
>> If you took out the
glass from the compass,

00:26:59.953 --> 00:27:01.620 align:middle line:10%
you could turn the
needle the other way,

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:10%
but you would have to
apply some force to it.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.930 align:middle line:10%
You have to push it to
flip to the other side.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:10%
And that is the
highest energy state.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.920 align:middle line:10%
In principle, if you were
so delicate to really

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:10%
put it exactly against
the magnetic field,

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:10%
it would stay there.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, so far, this is
basically just like a classical

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.840 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.750 align:middle line:84%
It's got two states--
spin up and spin down--

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:84%
which is like a
classical one and zero.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.270 align:middle line:10%
But the funny thing
about quantum objects

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:30.250 align:middle line:10%
is that they can be in
both states at once.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you measure the spin,
it will be either up or down.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.430 align:middle line:10%
But before you measure
it, the electron

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:10%
can exist in what's called a
quantum superposition, where

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.910 align:middle line:10%
these coefficients indicate the
relative probability of finding

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:10%
the electron in one
state or the other.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's hard to
imagine how this enables

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.200 align:middle line:10%
the incredible computing
power of quantum computers

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:10%
without considering two
interacting quantum bits.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:59.010 align:middle line:10%
Now there are four possible
states of these two electrons.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:10%
You could think
that, well, that's

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:10%
just like two bits of a
classical computer, right?

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:10.165 align:middle line:10%
If you have two bits, you
can write 0-0, 0-1, 1-0, 1-1.

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:12.780 align:middle line:10%
That's four numbers.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.530 align:middle line:10%
But these are still just
two bits of information.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:10%
All I need to say to determine
which one of the four numbers

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.100 align:middle line:10%
you have in your computer code
is the value of the first bit

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.420 align:middle line:10%
and the value of the second bit.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:30.630 align:middle line:10%
Here instead quantum
mechanics allows

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:10%
me to make superposition of
each one of these four states.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:10%
So I can write a quantum
mechanical state,

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:10%
which is perfectly
legitimate, that

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:10%
is some coefficient times
this plus some coefficient

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.920 align:middle line:10%
times that plus some
coefficient times that

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.780 align:middle line:10%
plus some coefficient.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.950 align:middle line:10%
So to determine the state
of this two-spin system,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.280 align:middle line:10%
I need to give you four
numbers, four coefficients,

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:10%
whereas in the classical
example of the two bits,

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.680 align:middle line:10%
I only need to
give you two bits.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:10%
So this is how you understand
why two qubits actually contain

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.850 align:middle line:10%
four bits of information.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:84%
I need to give you four
numbers to tell you

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.970 align:middle line:84%
the state of this system,
whereas here I only need two.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:10%
If we make three spins, we would
have eight different states.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.000 align:middle line:10%
I need to give you
eight different numbers

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:10%
to define the state
of those three spins,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.730 align:middle line:10%
whereas classical
is just three bits.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.920 align:middle line:10%
If you keep going,
what you'll find

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:10%
is that the amount of equivalent
classical information contained

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:10%
by n qubits is 2 to the
power n classical bits.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:45.210 align:middle line:10%
And of course, the
power of exponentials

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.370 align:middle line:10%
tells you that once
you have, let's

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:52.530 align:middle line:10%
say, 300 of those qubits
in what we call the fully

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:10%
entangled state-- so you must
be able to create these really

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:10%
crazy states where there is
a superposition of all 300

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:03.540 align:middle line:10%
being one way, and another way,
and another way, and so on.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:10%
Then you have like 2
to 300 classical bits,

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.580 align:middle line:10%
which is as many particles
as there are in the universe.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:10%
>> But there there's a catch.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:10%
Although--

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.400 align:middle line:10%
>> The rest of it kind of just
ends right there pretty much.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But this is important to
understand, because you need

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:22.210 align:middle line:90%
to be entangled, number one.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk
about quantum entanglement.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.803 align:middle line:10%
When you have that
many particles

00:30:25.803 --> 00:30:28.220 align:middle line:10%
quantum entangled, which we're
going to define in a minute

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.860 align:middle line:10%
if you don't know
what that means.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And then you have
these superpositions

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.250 align:middle line:10%
of all these different
states, now you

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:10%
have the capability of creating
wormholes, stable portals

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.970 align:middle line:10%
to get anywhere you want,
because you have the coding

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:10%
needed to make it happen.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:84%
If you have the coordinates
to these particular

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.065 align:middle line:84%
superpositions, it
can be a superposition

00:30:49.065 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
that takes you even to
a different dimension.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even have to be
another third-dimensional

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:90%
location.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.780 align:middle line:84%
It could be a
multidimensional location,

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.820 align:middle line:84%
because when you go
into superposition,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:84%
all states exist
at once, especially

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.250 align:middle line:90%
if you can get to n--

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:90%
to that power of n 200 bits.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.685 align:middle line:10%
So it's really powerful,
and it's really important

00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:10.690 align:middle line:10%
to understand that,
in my opinion,

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:10%
after researching these + 3
and researching technology,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.090 align:middle line:10%
how we're working
it right now, they

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:10%
have incorporated a quantum
computing system in collusion

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:25.770 align:middle line:10%
with this ability to integrate
this DNA storage capacity using

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:30.000 align:middle line:10%
the DNA of the person walking
through as the storage

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:10%
information, because, remember,
when you walk through a portal,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:34.590 align:middle line:10%
the information
has to be stored.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.230 align:middle line:10%
Every single spin rate,
every single atom,

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.710 align:middle line:10%
every location of
it on the XYZ axis

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.390 align:middle line:10%
has to be stored and maintained.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you won't come out
on the other end in one piece.

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.830 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
with teleportation.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
In teleportation, when-- you
know, "Beam me up, Scotty."

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, in teleportation,
when we do it even now,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and this has been
known for a long time,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.580 align:middle line:84%
the person that started
off at point A dies.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.570 align:middle line:84%
So the person that ends up
at the teleported point,

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the destination is
a copy, a facsimile.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
So in teleportation,
the first thing,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
whatever it is, if
it's a particle,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.380 align:middle line:84%
if it's an animal, an insect,
a human being, whatever it is,

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:90%
it's destroyed.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:22.520 align:middle line:84%
It must be destroyed at
point A. Point B is a copy.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.228 align:middle line:90%
So this is the big thing.

00:32:24.228 --> 00:32:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But how do you get your
consciousness back?

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:26.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you get--

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.170 align:middle line:90%
it's all about storage capacity.

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.840 align:middle line:84%
With this storage capacity,
anything is possible.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.050 align:middle line:10%
Without it, you don't come
out on the other side.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
So right now we're
just doing molecules,

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:84%
but now with the DNA hard drive
and with quantum computing,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.360 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see us
teleporting inanimate objects

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
within the next five
years to the space

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.570 align:middle line:90%
station and other places.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going
to see eventually

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.533 align:middle line:90%
small organic compounds.

00:32:51.533 --> 00:32:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And then once they're satisfied
with the organic compounds

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:55.575 align:middle line:84%
after a little bit
of time, then you're

00:32:55.575 --> 00:32:57.350 align:middle line:84%
going to see small--
unfortunately,

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.600 align:middle line:90%
they always go to the animals.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to go to animals.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They're going to use animals,
probably mice and so forth,

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:03.760 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, eventually,
human beings.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.800 align:middle line:84%
That's going to happen
eventually at some point.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately the
animals, they get the worst.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:90%
They always get experimented on.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
I feel bad for them.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we talk about
quantum entanglement.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.857 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have
seen this before.

00:33:21.857 --> 00:33:23.865 align:middle line:84%
Before we go into the
quasicrystal video,

00:33:23.865 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
quantum entanglement
is very important,

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.990 align:middle line:84%
because quantum entanglement
has to do with something called

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:90%
parabolic down conversion.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So parabolic down conversion
is when you take a laser,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:84%
and you use that laser to
phase shift two particles,

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
in this case maybe electrons,
to the same frequency.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.930 align:middle line:84%
And once you get them entangled
within that electromagnetic

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.820 align:middle line:84%
frequency, you can
take one particle

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.680 align:middle line:84%
to the other end of the universe
if you had the capability

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.640 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And whatever you change in
the particle local to you,

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.880 align:middle line:84%
the other one will
change instantaneously.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:57.380 align:middle line:84%
So it always happens
the opposite.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So the one local to you,
if you put it into a spin

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.780 align:middle line:84%
up position, the
one that-- it could

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:90%
be 10 billion light years away.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:90%
It'll spin down.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:84%
If you change it to a spin
down, that one will spin up.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And by that method, you
can transfer information

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:10.997 align:middle line:90%
back and forth.

00:34:10.997 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So with my tech company,
if you didn't know,

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.739 align:middle line:84%
I own a tech company called
First Class Space Agency.

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing a
white paper right now

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.460 align:middle line:84%
on a quantum-entangled deep
space communications array.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's all based off of
crystal technology and quantum

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:90%
entanglement.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.429 align:middle line:90%
So right now, if--

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.929 align:middle line:84%
let's just say we already know
that within the next 10 years

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.000 align:middle line:84%
we'll be traveling
out to the planets.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.350 align:middle line:90%
We're going out to Jupiter.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:34.929 align:middle line:90%
We're going out to Saturn.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:38.120 align:middle line:90%
15 years maybe tops.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Virgin Galactic is
really working on this.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.085 align:middle line:90%
He's got the two-way plane.

00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:44.429 align:middle line:84%
He's already done some
successful tests into space.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, though,
you're out that far.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It takes you a long
time to get there.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Now you're out that far.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:84%
You want to send a signal
back to Earth, a message back

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to Earth, back to space
command, whatever.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.665 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to take 30 days.

00:34:53.665 --> 00:34:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you've got
to get a response

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to get back, another 30 days
to get the response back.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
That's at the speed of light.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big problem.

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.870 align:middle line:84%
You need help,
assistance, or whatever.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Information traveling that
slow is a big problem.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:90%
How do you fix that problem?

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:90%
So you've sent out in advance--

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:84%
you've sent out
probes in advance

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:90%
into space, into deep space.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
And they are then connected
to this communications array.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
They'll be very far
apart, but it'll still

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.050 align:middle line:84%
be connected a lot quicker
than sending a signal to Earth.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And inside of those,
before they take off,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.010 align:middle line:84%
there will be
crystals in a quantum

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:84%
entanglement with the home base
crystal for communications.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Those will then be what
you send your message to.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you're out
there by Jupiter,

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.830 align:middle line:84%
you send a message to
the communications array.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:84%
The communications array,
the only delay you have now

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.910 align:middle line:84%
is whatever it takes
to get from your ship

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.327 align:middle line:84%
to the communications
array, which

00:35:42.327 --> 00:35:44.518 align:middle line:84%
can be a matter of
minutes or a few hours.

00:35:44.518 --> 00:35:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Once it gets to the
array, it's transmitted

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:84%
to Earth instantaneously
bypassing the speed of light

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.290 align:middle line:84%
without breaking the
theory of relativity.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:90%
And when it gets--

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.860 align:middle line:84%
what happens is it's just a
matter of spin ups and spin

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
downs, which is decoded
at the home base on Earth.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.087 align:middle line:84%
And the message spits out of
a computer instantaneously.

00:36:00.087 --> 00:36:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Hey, we're out here.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.420 align:middle line:84%
We need more
supplies or whatever.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:84%
We ran out of fuel,
whatever it is.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Or we're safe, and we're OK.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So you do a deep space
quantum-entangled

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.580 align:middle line:90%
communications array.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And now you can send a subspace
frequency instantaneously

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.070 align:middle line:84%
and communicate
without having to worry

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:17.903 align:middle line:84%
about waiting months,
and months, and months

00:36:17.903 --> 00:36:19.232 align:middle line:90%
for a response.

00:36:19.232 --> 00:36:20.940 align:middle line:84%
So quantum entanglement
is very powerful.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.670 align:middle line:84%
This is a 1 minute
and 48 second video.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may
have seen it before,

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's very important to
understand what this means.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The great granddaddy of
wacky quantum weirdness is

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.972 align:middle line:10%
entanglement.

00:36:32.972 --> 00:36:38.590 align:middle line:10%
If time reversal symmetry
destroys the notion of time,

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:42.830 align:middle line:10%
then entanglement crushes
our experience of space.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:10%
Two objects, two electrons
created together are entangled.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:10%
Send one to the other
side of the universe.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:03.000 align:middle line:10%
Now do something to one, and
the other responds instantly.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.260 align:middle line:10%
Instantly.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:10%
So either information is
traveling infinitely fast,

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:10%
or in reality, they
are still connected.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.990 align:middle line:10%
They are entangled.

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:22.570 align:middle line:10%
And since everything was
entangled at the moment

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:10%
of the Big Bang, that means
everything is still touching.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:34.190 align:middle line:10%
Space is just a construct that
gives the illusion that there

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:10%
are separate objects.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.840 align:middle line:10%
Are we far enough down
the rabbit hole yet?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything is
still touching, right?

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So electrons are
also intelligent,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.670 align:middle line:84%
as we learned the other
day in my previous class.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Electrons have the
capability of making

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:90%
decisions, conscious decisions.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.060 align:middle line:10%
Everything is conscious.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:10%
So we look at the
double slit experiment.

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And in the double
slit slit experiment,

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.770 align:middle line:10%
we sent electrons through
two little microscopic slits

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.020 align:middle line:10%
to see what it would do
when it hit the back wall.

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.510 align:middle line:10%
Would it create a
digital pattern or wave

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:10%
on the back wall?

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, what happened was
when we weren't looking,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
it created a wave
pattern on the back wall,

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:17.390 align:middle line:84%
which means that the electrons
became electromagnetic waves

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and operated as a wave function,
and not digital bits of data.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:23.930 align:middle line:84%
When we looked at it, when
we put a looking device there

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to see it go through
the slits, the electrons

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.270 align:middle line:84%
decided to change back
to a digital pattern.

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So the prospect of observing,
conscious observation

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.360 align:middle line:84%
of electrons, changed
the way they behave.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.730 align:middle line:84%
They decided to do something
different based off

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.720 align:middle line:90%
of conscious intervention.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So by that method we see
how consciousness interacts

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:84%
with the subatomic world to
help create our own reality.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.710 align:middle line:84%
We are actually co-creators
in this reality.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And on top of that, based
on what we just saw,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
we now know that all particles
are still connected, which

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:56.940 align:middle line:90%
means that nothing is separate.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:57.740 align:middle line:90%
We're connected.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.585 align:middle line:84%
Separation is an illusion, what
I was talking about earlier.

00:39:00.585 --> 00:39:01.460 align:middle line:90%
It's all an illusion.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.860 align:middle line:84%
We're all on the same grid,
and we're all connected.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:90%
We appear to be separate.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
99.999% empty space.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.030 align:middle line:84%
There's 7.5 billion
people on Earth.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And if I took away
all the empty space

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.380 align:middle line:84%
in all the atoms
of all the people,

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I can fit everyone into
one sugar cube, all people.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.520 align:middle line:90%
So we're not even here.

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what creates
this third dimension?

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.507 align:middle line:90%
We know we're connected.

00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We know that information
can be stored

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:84%
inside the human body for
the purpose of transmitting

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:32.810 align:middle line:90%
ourselves to other realms.

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We know that quantum computers
can handle that programming

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and that trajectory to get
us to these different super

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:39.570 align:middle line:90%
positions.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
what is the shadow that

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.330 align:middle line:90%
creates the third dimension.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:48.220 align:middle line:84%
The third dimension is a
shadow of a higher dimension.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.532 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
that for a second.

00:39:50.532 --> 00:39:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It also has a pattern,
but it isn't periodic.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:59.450 align:middle line:10%
So it's not a crystal.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:10%
But there's a deep
connection between the 2D

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.440 align:middle line:10%
object on the sand and
the 3D mother crystal.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:10%
This distorted 2D pattern
is called a quasicrystal.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:14.210 align:middle line:10%
A quasicrystal in a certain
dimension, in this case, 2D,

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:17.120 align:middle line:10%
is a projection of a crystal
in a higher dimension,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:19.430 align:middle line:10%
in this case 3D.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:10%
A group of physicists
in Los Angeles

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:25.310 align:middle line:10%
is working on a new physics
theory for a particular 8D

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.900 align:middle line:10%
crystal.

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:29.870 align:middle line:10%
Yep, that's right, an
eight-dimensional crystal

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.840 align:middle line:10%
is projected to 4D at a
very particular angle,

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:10%
which forms a 4D quasicrystal.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:42.890 align:middle line:10%
And from this 4D
quasicrystal, they

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:46.970 align:middle line:10%
derive a 3D quasicrystal,
which they believe

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:51.140 align:middle line:10%
is the fundamental
substructure of all of reality.

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> So we see--

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.028 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, you see where
we're going with this.

00:40:54.028 --> 00:40:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let's unpack a tesseract,
because a tesseract

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.780 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
part of ancient history.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.450 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, it's
what was involved,

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:04.367 align:middle line:10%
or what was inside of
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:06.110 align:middle line:10%
a four-dimensional cube.

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:10.370 align:middle line:84%
about a four-dimensional
cube, because it's

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:12.680 align:middle line:90%
a cube of unparalleled power.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And it gives you the access to
the past, present, and future,

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.760 align:middle line:10%
and any location you want to
be in all at the same time.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:10%
So this is something
that's encapsulated

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.260 align:middle line:10%
in something called Metatron's
cube, if you've ever

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.060 align:middle line:10%
heard of that.

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.040 align:middle line:84%
That's inside the
Flower of Life.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.136 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
quick peek at this.

00:41:30.136 --> 00:41:33.468 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:33.468 --> 00:41:37.760 align:middle line:90%


00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.593 align:middle line:10%
We're unpacking the
fourth dimension

00:41:39.593 --> 00:41:42.650 align:middle line:10%
from two-dimensional space.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.930 align:middle line:10%
>> 528 DNA

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.624 align:middle line:10%
>> By the way, that's my
first song I ever produced.

00:41:49.624 --> 00:41:53.110 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:41:53.110 --> 00:42:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.543 align:middle line:84%
So when you unpack a
fourth-dimensional cube

00:42:32.543 --> 00:42:34.460 align:middle line:84%
into three-dimensional
space, you get a cross.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:37.860 align:middle line:90%


00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.213 align:middle line:84%
The cross is the same cross
as the Templar's cross,

00:42:41.213 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and some other
crosses that you're

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.310 align:middle line:84%
going to see, another very
important sign that you're

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:48.940 align:middle line:90%
going to see in a little bit.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But you get a cross
when you unpack

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.270 align:middle line:84%
a fourth-dimensional cube,
which is Metatron's cube, which

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:58.350 align:middle line:84%
is considered by the
Ancients to be an archangel.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:42:59.580 align:middle line:90%
Michael, the archangel.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:10%
Everything from the ancient
times when you listen to it

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.190 align:middle line:10%
and you compare it then to
a modern day understanding

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.080 align:middle line:10%
of science, physics,
and technology,

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.520 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see how they were
using words and terminologies

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.640 align:middle line:10%
to the best of their ability to
explain the things that we're

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:23.730 align:middle line:10%
now explaining or showing out
to be technology or science.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.130 align:middle line:84%
But think about a
fourth-dimensional cube.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Who here saw "Interstellar"?

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:10%
So he got into a
tesseract on his way

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:10%
back when the ship was going
through that weird space.

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:90%
He came out of the ship.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:37.480 align:middle line:90%
He didn't die.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.897 align:middle line:84%
He ended up inside
of a tesseract.

00:43:38.897 --> 00:43:40.308 align:middle line:90%
He ended up inside of this.

00:43:40.308 --> 00:43:42.850 align:middle line:10%
This is what he was inside of,
a fourth-dimensional cube that

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:43.990 align:middle line:10%
was unpacked.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And then he was able to see
the past, present, and future

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.740 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And how can that be?

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:84%
How can you see the past,
present, and future at once?

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.758 align:middle line:84%
Well, just think about
it from our perspective,

00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:55.510 align:middle line:84%
if you are looking at a one
dimensional object, which

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is a line on a
piece of paper, you

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
being from the third
dimension can see the line.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.460 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Look at the front of it.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Look at the back of it.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
If you draw a two-dimensional
object on a piece of paper,

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.482 align:middle line:84%
like a house, or even
use a computer to do it,

00:44:09.482 --> 00:44:10.690 align:middle line:90%
that's still two dimensional.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Even though it may appear
to be three, it's only two.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You can see in the house.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
back of the house.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:17.740 align:middle line:84%
You can look in the rooms,
the closets, the bathroom,

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no privacy.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:90%
You're in the third dimension.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.940 align:middle line:90%
You control.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.710 align:middle line:84%
You dominate the
second dimension.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And the second dimension
and the first dimension

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.150 align:middle line:90%
has no idea you even exist.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine being in
the fourth dimension.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.900 align:middle line:90%
You're in a tesseract.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.900 align:middle line:84%
You're able to see the
past, present, and future

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:90%
all at once.

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.885 align:middle line:84%
You're able to dominate
the third dimension.

00:44:36.885 --> 00:44:39.010 align:middle line:84%
We wouldn't even know if
a fourth-dimensional being

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.480 align:middle line:84%
was walking on stage
with me right now.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.563 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't perceive that
fourth-dimensional being

00:44:42.563 --> 00:44:44.590 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective, right?

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine, that this
whole hotel is spacetime.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, imagine yourself
in this room,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.070 align:middle line:10%
and the other room you went
to earlier, and another room

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.487 align:middle line:10%
you went to earlier, another
room you went to earlier, all

00:44:56.487 --> 00:44:57.430 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.408 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, you were
there in different times.

00:45:00.408 --> 00:45:02.200 align:middle line:84%
So a fourth dimensional
being would see you

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.867 align:middle line:84%
in every single one
of those conferences

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that you were at, the lectures
you went to today all at once.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be a
little bit younger

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in this one, a little
bit older in this one,

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:84%
because time has passed
in the third dimension,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.190 align:middle line:84%
but a fourth-dimensional being
would be able to see that.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:17.620 align:middle line:84%
Fifth dimension, sixth
dimension, all the way on up.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Every dimension you
go up, you dominate

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.110 align:middle line:84%
over the smaller, or the
younger, or the lower

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:24.610 align:middle line:90%
dimensions.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.050 align:middle line:10%
And according to
quantum physics,

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.900 align:middle line:10%
there's 11 dimensions that
make up this entire universe.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.540 align:middle line:10%
According to
theoretical physicists,

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.567 align:middle line:10%
without 11 dimensions, this
universe would collapse.

00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:35.650 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it has something to
do with the power of 11.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.082 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we see it all
the time, that 11:11.

00:45:38.082 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:84%
But maybe it has
something to do with it.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.165 align:middle line:10%
Maybe we're in
synchronicity with

00:45:41.165 --> 00:45:42.403 align:middle line:10%
the universal consciousness.

00:45:42.403 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
seeing 11's all the time.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But 11 dimensions is
what we're talking about.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
ancients, ascended masters

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.630 align:middle line:84%
would ascend to
the 11th dimension.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.282 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go to
the ancient history

00:45:55.282 --> 00:45:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and you come to
the modern history,

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and Michio Kaku was
saying the same thing

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that these ancient sages were
saying thousands of years ago.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It's really amazing.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:08.883 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Merkaba, which we talk about

00:46:08.883 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:90%
in the Mystery School.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk a little
bit about the Merkaba today.

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba is
another method used

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:90%
by the ancients for travel.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.840 align:middle line:84%
They would travel in a
counter-rotating tetrahedron,

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:23.290 align:middle line:84%
which is two pyramids, one
on top, one on the bottom,

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.800 align:middle line:90%
that would counter-rotate.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like a light vessel.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So they would
actually be able to go

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:31.330 align:middle line:84%
into a specific
type of meditation,

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and get into this light
vehicle, and travel

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.390 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Some with the physical body, and
some only with consciousness.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, "Thoth
the Atlantean,"

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.120 align:middle line:84%
he talks about the
capability of getting

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.010 align:middle line:90%
into this light vehicle.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.550 align:middle line:90%
And he would travel the world--

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.350 align:middle line:90%
the universe.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.080 align:middle line:84%
He actually says he
went to many worlds,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and he watched
civilizations rise and fall.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.630 align:middle line:84%
How can you watch many
civilizations rise

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.130 align:middle line:90%
and fall without aging?

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.850 align:middle line:90%
His mind is outside of space.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Mind is outside of time.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.740 align:middle line:84%
So what may have been thousands
of years for one civilization,

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:07.720 align:middle line:84%
or maybe even tens of
thousands of years,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:84%
could have only been
just a few moments

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:11.530 align:middle line:84%
for Thoth in that
particular mind state,

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.570 align:middle line:84%
because the mind is
outside of spacetime.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.590 align:middle line:84%
When I studied remote
viewing with Major Ed Dames,

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.380 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know who that
is, look up Project Stargate.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.810 align:middle line:84%
He's the guy who taught
me in remote viewing.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And in remote viewing,
you discover quickly

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.090 align:middle line:84%
house how good mind is
outside of time and space.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.010 align:middle line:10%
You get a target
in remote viewing.

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And remote viewing is when you
take your mind to a target,

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to find a target, and bring
back intel on that target.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So the first test that I had,
the target is just a number.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had no idea what
the target was going to be,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.575 align:middle line:84%
where it was, if it
was even on Earth.

00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It was just a number.

00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:47.360 align:middle line:90%
They give you a number.

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:48.568 align:middle line:90%
They know what the target is.

00:47:48.568 --> 00:47:49.910 align:middle line:90%
You just get a number.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And with that number, you have
to go through this particular

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.080 align:middle line:84%
process of this awaken,
half-sleep, meditation,

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.485 align:middle line:90%
where you really--

00:47:58.485 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like an
Edgar Cayce type thing,

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.560 align:middle line:84%
but not as deep
as Edgar Cayce got

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.765 align:middle line:90%
in terms of his wakefulness.

00:48:03.765 --> 00:48:05.140 align:middle line:84%
You were a little
bit more awake,

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.307 align:middle line:84%
because you have to stop
and write information down.

00:48:07.307 --> 00:48:10.690 align:middle line:84%
But what's really amazing
is on my very first test,

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I drew this big,
oblong, kind of a circle

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.030 align:middle line:84%
with this squiggly line
coming off the bottom.

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And when they sent
me my results,

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.360 align:middle line:84%
it was a hot air balloon
with the rope coming down

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.560 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And so based on that
is why he decided

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:27.670 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to be my trainer.

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:29.520 align:middle line:90%
So remote feeling is real.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's what I use to find
a lot of anomalies on Mars

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.420 align:middle line:90%
when I go to the space data.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Instead of spending
hours upon hours

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.380 align:middle line:84%
upon hours, which I used to
do with a magnifying glass,

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.550 align:middle line:84%
going centimeter
by centimeter, I

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.800 align:middle line:90%
started remote viewing images.

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.217 align:middle line:84%
So I would take
the target number.

00:48:42.217 --> 00:48:44.850 align:middle line:84%
The target number would be
whatever the NASA image number

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.020 align:middle line:84%
would be, or the Caltech
number for the image,

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.103 align:middle line:84%
or the European Space
Agency number for the image.

00:48:51.103 --> 00:48:53.145 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, I
would do a remote viewing.

00:48:53.145 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I would search for anomalies
based on those targets.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
go to the image,

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.557 align:middle line:84%
and I would go almost
directly to each anomaly

00:48:58.557 --> 00:49:00.240 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
find, and I would then

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.018 align:middle line:90%
catalog them into the database.

00:49:02.018 --> 00:49:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So we'll talk about that.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And we'll show some of those
space anomalies tonight.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:10.850 align:middle line:90%
So the tesseract.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood has hid the
tesseract in plain sight.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:14.663 align:middle line:84%
The tesseract is the
fourth-dimensional cube

00:49:14.663 --> 00:49:16.570 align:middle line:90%
that we just talked about.

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.750 align:middle line:84%
It's been called the
cosmic cube, the hypercube.

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:20.490 align:middle line:84%
It appeared in
"Avengers, Infinity War,"

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:23.700 align:middle line:84%
"Captain America: the First
Avenger," "A Wrinkle in Time,"

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.670 align:middle line:84%
"Iron Man 2," "X-Men,"
"The Matrix," "Thor,"

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:30.900 align:middle line:84%
"The Avengers," "Interstellar,"
"The Dark World Prelude,"

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.980 align:middle line:90%
"Transformers."

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And they even called one
of the characters Megatron

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
after Metatron, you
know what I mean?

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.110 align:middle line:84%
They always try to hide
the truth in plain sight.

00:49:40.110 --> 00:49:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the tesseract
more recently debuted

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.300 align:middle line:84%
"A Wrinkle in Time," also
known as the cosmic cube.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.580 align:middle line:84%
That's the one that Oprah
Winfrey was involved in.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.070 align:middle line:84%
It's an enchanted object
of unparalleled power.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Metatron was originally
a human elevated

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to archangel by
the god-- this is

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.895 align:middle line:84%
according to the Ancients--
for his services as a scribe.

00:49:55.895 --> 00:49:59.190 align:middle line:84%
The foremost communicator
between humans and the divine.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.560 align:middle line:90%
He is best known for his cube.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.060 align:middle line:84%
To understand the meaning
of sacred geometry symbols,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube is based on
a deceptively simple pattern

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:10.560 align:middle line:84%
called the Fruit of Life,
13 connected circles, which

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.750 align:middle line:84%
is in the concentrated
ancient Flower of Life,

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:15.360 align:middle line:84%
inscribed on the walls of
the Assyrian temple at Abydos

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.187 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:17.770 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you that
a little bit later.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.160 align:middle line:84%
The Flower of Life is a
specific, rarely repeating

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:84%
pattern of circles rotating
around a central point.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And it contains a vast
Akashic system of information.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.710 align:middle line:84%
That's what stores the
Akashic information.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It's inside the Flower of Life
symbol, which in my opinion

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is also what I call
the face of God,

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.540 align:middle line:84%
including the templates
for five platonic solids,

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.828 align:middle line:84%
key sacred shapes, which are
the building blocks of creation.

00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So to sum it up,
the sacred geometric

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.180 align:middle line:84%
shapes forming the life
begins as an ovum, a sphere,

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:47.880 align:middle line:84%
becomes a tetrahedron, then
a star tetrahedron, then

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.850 align:middle line:84%
a cube, another sphere,
and finally a torus.

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Metatron's cube is
also known, to me,

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:56.370 align:middle line:84%
as what was inside of
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a quick
look at this clip.

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:00.996 align:middle line:90%
>> Talk to me, doctor.

00:51:00.996 --> 00:51:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Director.

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:04.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
we know for certain?

00:51:04.785 --> 00:51:07.095 align:middle line:90%
>> The tesseract is misbehaving.

00:51:07.095 --> 00:51:08.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that supposed to be funny?

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.480 align:middle line:10%
>> No, it's not funny at all.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.060 align:middle line:10%
The tesseract is
not only active.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.945 align:middle line:10%
She's behaving.

00:51:13.945 --> 00:51:15.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I assumed you
pulled the plug.

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.280 align:middle line:10%
>> She's an energy source.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:10%
We turn off the power.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:10%
She turns it back on.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.840 align:middle line:10%
If she reaches peak level--

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> We're prepared
for this, doctor,

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:10%
harnessing energy from space.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:10%
>> We don't have the harness.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.860 align:middle line:10%
My calculations are
far from complete.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.350 align:middle line:10%
She's throwing off
interference, radiation.

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Nothing harmful, low
levels of gamma radiation.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.270 align:middle line:10%
>> That can be harmful.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:38.190 align:middle line:10%
Where's agent Barton?

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:40.530 align:middle line:10%
>> The Hawk?

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.225 align:middle line:10%
Up in his nest as usual.

00:51:44.225 --> 00:51:46.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Agent Barton, report.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.240 align:middle line:10%
I gave you this
detail so you could

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:51.000 align:middle line:10%
keep a close eye on things.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Two things that
happened in that clip.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.770 align:middle line:84%
He called the energy
source-- the other scientist,

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.540 align:middle line:90%
he called it a she.

00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:58.770 align:middle line:90%
She keeps the power on.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.440 align:middle line:90%
She, she, she, she.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.350 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I talk about in
some of my previous classes

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.960 align:middle line:84%
for other things, the
energy source emanating out

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.480 align:middle line:84%
of the vesica piscis, which
is part of the Flower of Life

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.010 align:middle line:90%
is a feminine energy.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The energy that comes out
of the womb of creation

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:16.290 align:middle line:90%
is a feminine energy.

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.960 align:middle line:84%
It interacts with masculine
energy for balance.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But the energy that
creates everything

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in this entire third
dimension comes from a womb.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.010 align:middle line:84%
That's very important
to understand.

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:28.830 align:middle line:84%
What we've done as men
is we've taken control

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.450 align:middle line:90%
and dominated this planet.

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've suppressed and
oppressed women, and taken away

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.540 align:middle line:84%
the feminine divine, taken
away this whole female energy.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence of
this, just go to Cairo.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Who's been to Cairo?

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:43.592 align:middle line:90%
Everything is brown.

00:52:43.592 --> 00:52:44.550 align:middle line:90%
There's only one color.

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.800 align:middle line:90%
There's no flowers and plants.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.370 align:middle line:90%
There's garbage in the streets.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Everything is dirty.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything is filthy.

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.380 align:middle line:90%
There's dirt.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.110 align:middle line:84%
There's garbage
dumped in the Nile.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.830 align:middle line:84%
The canals are full
of muck and dirt.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:59.000 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, you know why?

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Because the women there are
heavily, heavily oppressed.

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:04.350 align:middle line:84%
They can't even-- all they
can show is their eyeballs.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:05.150 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to a
register to buy some oils,

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.320 align:middle line:90%
the woman couldn't look at me.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.110 align:middle line:84%
She had to give me
my change like this.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
That's how oppressed they are.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So you see the removal of the
feminine energy in that one

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.740 align:middle line:84%
little area, and you see
what happens to the area.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a gigantic
bachelor pad.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it is what it is.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:24.347 align:middle line:90%
You have to have balance.

00:53:24.347 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:90%
There's a role from a man.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:26.630 align:middle line:90%
There's a role for a woman.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
There's a role for
these energies.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:29.943 align:middle line:90%
We both emit energy.

00:53:29.943 --> 00:53:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
balance over there.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.240 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.100 align:middle line:90%
So you can just imagine--

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:90%
just extrapolate that.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Back in the day with the
temples, and everything else,

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.530 align:middle line:84%
women weren't even
allowed to go into temple.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:40.940 align:middle line:84%
They weren't allowed to
go inside of churches.

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.148 align:middle line:90%
They weren't allowed to talk.

00:53:42.148 --> 00:53:43.610 align:middle line:90%
They weren't allowed to vote.

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:46.640 align:middle line:84%
All the suppression and
oppression putting down.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at all the wars we have.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.665 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we would've had
all these wars if there were

00:53:50.665 --> 00:53:52.550 align:middle line:90%
some female rulers and kings?

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Like back in the day, we had
Queen Tiye in the Land of Kem?

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.450 align:middle line:84%
There was a peace and
harmony at that time.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.560 align:middle line:90%
That was King Tut's grandmother.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.290 align:middle line:84%
People were all into
arts, and theater,

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:06.103 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to be in
oneness with themselves.

00:54:06.103 --> 00:54:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
we got taken over,

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.770 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, because
we were so nice.

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:10.990 align:middle line:90%
Somebody said, wait a minute.

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.590 align:middle line:90%
They too easy.

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:16.282 align:middle line:84%
And Egypt was taken
over seven times.

00:54:16.282 --> 00:54:17.240 align:middle line:90%
People don't know that.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Seven times Egypt was conquered.

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.590 align:middle line:90%
But you look at it.

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.490 align:middle line:84%
What if the world
was balanced more

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.012 align:middle line:84%
with the feminine and
masculine energies?

00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:84%
I think we'd have a
much different world.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Right now, it's
over male dominated,

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.290 align:middle line:90%
in my personal opinion.

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, the
energy balance is off.

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear to see,
very clear to see.

00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:37.570 align:middle line:90%
That's just my take on it.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, where does
the energy source

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:41.338 align:middle line:90%
come from for these star gates?

00:54:41.338 --> 00:54:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Energy source, so
let's look at that.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:46.130 align:middle line:84%
The energy source comes
from the body as well.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Scientists concluded that
the average human body

00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:51.890 align:middle line:84%
contains approximately
37.5 trillion cells.

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Each cell generates 0.07
volts of electricity.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:02.140 align:middle line:84%
At 37.5 trillion cells,
that's 2.63 trillion volts

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:05.040 align:middle line:84%
of electricity in
one human body.

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us is a
walking nuclear explosion.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:13.440 align:middle line:84%
That's in your body, 2.63
trillion volts of electricity.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.300 align:middle line:90%
So the power source is here.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.220 align:middle line:90%
The memory source is here.

00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The ability for the quantum
mode, the quantum computing

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:23.160 align:middle line:90%
is also inside of us.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's inside
of our consciousness.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.940 align:middle line:84%
We have built-in
quantum computers.

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability
to process qubits.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The quantum computers
we're developing now

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:84%
are being built
to try to imitate

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.280 align:middle line:84%
human consciousness, the
ability to be in superposition,

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:36.150 align:middle line:90%
and have--

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:38.280 align:middle line:84%
our brains are
multi-dimensional.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.780 align:middle line:84%
We are-- it's
already been proven

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that our synapses phase in
and out of the third dimension

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:44.310 align:middle line:90%
randomly.

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:45.943 align:middle line:84%
And they don't even
know where they go.

00:55:45.943 --> 00:55:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're going
to other dimensions.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.900 align:middle line:90%
That's where they're going.

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Just like gravity, gravity drops
down from multiple dimensions

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:84%
before it gets to
the third density.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's why gravity is
the weakest force in science.

00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Because by the time it gets
to us, it's been diluted.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why you can take
a very small magnet

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and pick it up with
another magnet.

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.530 align:middle line:84%
You can pull against Earth's
gravity with another magnet,

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.750 align:middle line:84%
because gravity is
the weakest force.

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Right now the human
body has enough power

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to create the energy needed
to jump through a portal,

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and to hold open a
stable portal as well.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.660 align:middle line:84%
This is how you can have
a portal or a star gate

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.320 align:middle line:84%
somewhere that-- we're going
to look at some of them that

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.590 align:middle line:90%
look like just plain rock.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.378 align:middle line:90%
Where's the energy source?

00:56:25.378 --> 00:56:26.670 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to look at that.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from the human body.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:30.800 align:middle line:90%
This is something we all have.

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.530 align:middle line:84%
We have the torus energy
field around our body.

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.140 align:middle line:84%
All these are the same
thing, the Shri Yantra.

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The Shri Yantra,
if you look at it,

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.570 align:middle line:84%
it's really a
64-grid tetrahedron,

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.870 align:middle line:84%
which is what you see
inside the Flower of Life.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And the 64-grid tetrahedron
encapsulates something

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.460 align:middle line:10%
called the vector equilibrium.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.050 align:middle line:10%
And the vector
equilibrium is a source

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.900 align:middle line:10%
of unparalleled free
energy, free power.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.480 align:middle line:10%
Free energy exists
at every Planck unit

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.030 align:middle line:10%
in spacetime around us,
in us, and through us

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:00.143 align:middle line:10%
every single where.

00:57:00.143 --> 00:57:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you can see that that's
what the Shri Yantra represents

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:03.610 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.420 align:middle line:84%
The Merkaba are the
dimensions of the human body.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:84%
You can get into a
star tetrahedron,

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.187 align:middle line:84%
but it also can be
represented as your aura.

00:57:10.187 --> 00:57:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Right now every single one of
us is emitting this torus energy

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:13.700 align:middle line:90%
field around our body.

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Some are projecting it maybe
8 to 10 feet away, some 15,

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.252 align:middle line:90%
some people even 20 feet.

00:57:18.252 --> 00:57:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This is why when somebody
can walk into a room,

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and you can say you
can feel their energy.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.087 align:middle line:90%
That's not a fake statement.

00:57:23.087 --> 00:57:24.243 align:middle line:90%
That's a real statement.

00:57:24.243 --> 00:57:26.660 align:middle line:84%
You can feel somebody's energy
when they walk into a room,

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.270 align:middle line:84%
because their energy transmits
to your energy field.

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:32.540 align:middle line:10%
So let's take a look at
the secret of 3, 6, and 9

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:35.260 align:middle line:10%
from Nikola Tesla real quick.

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:36.890 align:middle line:90%

is he says the key to
the universe, the key.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Portals and star
gates require keys.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.984 align:middle line:84%
And now we're building
up the Flower of Life.

Mitosis.

This can be considered
mitosis and cell division.

01:01:03.352 --> 01:01:05.310 align:middle line:84%
This is how you create
a biological avatar, how

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
you create a human body,
through this exact same method.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You can build building

to build through this method.

of each one of those spheres.

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to create the grid
that creates all of the matrix

The secret to this
and why it's important

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:44.730 align:middle line:10%
is because this is
how you get your codes

to get to your locations.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It's all based off
of this 3, 6, 9.

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.140 align:middle line:84%

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Creating a stable wormhole
is very hard to do.

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the mathematics
that will keep a portal,

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
a star gate actually open.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:33.662 align:middle line:90%


01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they doing this at CERN?

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:37.450 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
going to get into.

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That's what they're
doing at CERN.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So at CERN, they have a
Large Hadron Collider.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
smashes atoms together

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and creates microscopic
black holes.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
So in CERN, they have something
called the Large Hadron

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Collider.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.132 align:middle line:84%
And the Large Hadron Collider,
it's one of the largest--

01:04:58.132 --> 01:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it is the largest
machine on Earth, actually.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
It's about four miles in
diameter, underground.

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.503 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is they
send a particle one way.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
They send another
particle the other way

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.280 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then they smash
them together.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And by smashing
them together, they

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
get to see what those
particles are made of.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You get smaller, smaller
particles, tiny, I mean,

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
microscopic particles.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.763 align:middle line:84%
But you also can create
microscopic black holes.

01:05:22.763 --> 01:05:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So at one point,
people were very scared

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that one of these black
holes would become stable.

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole Earth
would get sucked into it.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it sounds
crazy, but it's actually

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.968 align:middle line:90%
something to really consider.

01:05:31.968 --> 01:05:33.340 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Black holes, we don't really
fully understand them.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
But so far, these
microscopic black holes

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
only last for a
very small amount

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.223 align:middle line:84%
of time, Planck units
of moments of time.

01:05:42.223 --> 01:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is a little bit where we
were talking about earlier when

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
we were showing these fields.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You have a galaxy,
which has a torus field.

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has a torus
field based off of magnets.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And the human body,
trees with roots,

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, on the cellular
level and the DNA level.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything operates within this.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.540 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Ancients have
figured this out,

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and have been able
to incorporate

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the capability of integrating a
human body with its own field,

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:11.590 align:middle line:90%
which has its own code.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us has
our own unique coded

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.430 align:middle line:90%
field, just like a fingerprint.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:17.743 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
only specific people

01:06:17.743 --> 01:06:19.660 align:middle line:84%
were allowed to walk
through these star gates,

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.888 align:middle line:84%
because they had to have their
code programmed into the gate.

01:06:23.888 --> 01:06:25.930 align:middle line:10%
This toroidal structure
of the human energy field

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:28.510 align:middle line:10%
has been mapped out by the
Institute of HeartMath.

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.610 align:middle line:10%
They've used sensitive
electrocardiographs

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:32.830 align:middle line:10%
to measure the
electromagnetic pulses that

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.950 align:middle line:10%
emanate from the center
of our torus, the heart.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.050 align:middle line:10%
The field generated was
measured to extend up

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:40.120 align:middle line:10%
to 12 feet around
the human body.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.640 align:middle line:10%
And they discovered that
the human and other animals

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.560 align:middle line:10%
can sense this energy
field when in close

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.710 align:middle line:10%
proximity to each other.

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:47.710 align:middle line:10%
So this is a real field.

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:48.510 align:middle line:10%
It's not fake.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It's a real thing
that actually happens.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.002 align:middle line:84%
History has talked
about the Merkaba.

01:06:53.002 --> 01:06:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a vehicle that
allows a person

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.490 align:middle line:84%
to ascend or descend into
higher or lower worlds.

01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:00.763 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the Merkabah, or
Merkaba, as some people say it,

01:07:00.763 --> 01:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
is much more than just
a vehicle of ascension.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.590 align:middle line:84%
It can literally be
anything, since it

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
is the primal
pattern that created

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:10.955 align:middle line:84%
all things in all universes,
both visible and invisible.

01:07:10.955 --> 01:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible there
is a reference

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
in Ezekiel in the
wheels by which

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:16.120 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel ascended into heaven.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.000 align:middle line:84%
In the Torah, there's a
reference to the Merkavah,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
which is the way the
Hebrews spell it,

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
which has two
different meanings.

01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
One meaning is a chariot,
and the other is a vehicle.

01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a vehicle.

01:07:28.090 --> 01:07:29.537 align:middle line:90%
The other is a throne of God.

01:07:29.537 --> 01:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
When the two definitions
are combined,

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.530 align:middle line:90%
the true meaning comes to life.

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt
this primal pattern

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
was called the
Merkabah or Merkaba.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And it actually is three words.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Mer meant the kind of light
that rotated within itself.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Ka means spirit, and
of course-- in the case

01:07:44.020 --> 01:07:45.370 align:middle line:90%
referring to the human spirit.

01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And the bah meant
the human body.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
So it could mean
that this concept

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:51.458 align:middle line:84%
of reality that
the spirit holds,

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and also the entire
world and ancient Egypt

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.600 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the
rotating light that

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
could take the spirit body
from one world into another.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, the atomic
structure of gold

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
is the geometric shape of
the star tetrahedron, a.k.a.

01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.430 align:middle line:90%
the Merkaba.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.800 align:middle line:10%
And this Merkaba,
this light vessel,

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:12.610 align:middle line:10%
this ability to travel to other
dimensions and through portals

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:16.300 align:middle line:10%
is known since ancient times.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:21.520 align:middle line:10%
It became a symbol of a race,
or being God's chosen people.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.990 align:middle line:84%
But in true reality, it's
even deeper than that.

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The Star of David, the Star of
David is a star tetrahedron.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:31.330 align:middle line:90%
It's a Merkaba.

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:33.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people who
wear the Star of David

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:36.279 align:middle line:84%
think it's just saying,
oh, I'm the chosen one,

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and we were the chosen
people, and things like that.

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:40.207 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually deeper, even
much more deeper than that.

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:43.930 align:middle line:84%
So a Star of David,
Hebrew, Magen David,

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
which is also known as
the shield of David,

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish symbol
composed of two

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
overlaid equilateral triangles
form a six-pointed star.

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:55.359 align:middle line:84%
It appears on synagogues,
Jewish tombstones, and the flag

01:08:55.359 --> 01:08:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of the state of Israel.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.470 align:middle line:84%
The symbol, which historically
was not limited to use by Jews,

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.689 align:middle line:84%
originated in
antiquity, when side

01:09:01.689 --> 01:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
by side with the
five-pointed star

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.958 align:middle line:84%
it served as a magical
sign or a declaration.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.500 align:middle line:84%
In the Middle Ages,
the Star of David

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
appeared with a greater
frequency among Jews,

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.069 align:middle line:84%
but did not assume any special
religious significance.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It is found as well in
some medieval cathedrals.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And the term Magen David,
which in Jewish liturgy

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
signifies god as the protector
or the shield of David,

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:26.229 align:middle line:84%
gained currency among
medieval Jewish mystics

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.990 align:middle line:84%
who attached magical powers
to King David's shield,

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:31.359 align:middle line:84%
just as earlier
magical traditions had

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
referred to the five-pointed
star as the seal of Solomon.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalists popularized
the use of the symbol

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.942 align:middle line:84%
as a protection
against evil spirits.

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:40.359 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish community
of Prague was

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:43.510 align:middle line:84%
the first to use the Star of
David as its official symbol.

01:09:43.510 --> 01:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
From the 17th century,
the sixth-pointed star

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
became the official seal
of many Jewish communities

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and a general sign of Judaism.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Though it has no biblical
or Talmudic authority,

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
the star was almost
universally adopted by Jews

01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:01.000 align:middle line:84%
in the 19th century as a
striking and simple emblem

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.620 align:middle line:90%
of Judaism.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
The imitation of the cross of
Christianity, the yellow badge

01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
that Jews were forced to wear
in the Nazi-occupied Europe

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
invested the Star of
David with a symbolism,

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.450 align:middle line:90%
indicating martyrdom or heroism.

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But the Star of David goes
much deeper than that.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.837 align:middle line:90%
This is just on the surface.

01:10:19.837 --> 01:10:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It's actually much deeper.

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about
in ancient times,

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.780 align:middle line:84%
if you go into the
ancient Ethiopian records,

01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
they're talking
about the Merkaba.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Ethiopian
records, which is

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.247 align:middle line:84%
where I'll be, because I'm
going to Ethiopia to look

01:10:31.247 --> 01:10:33.517 align:middle line:84%
at the temple, the
Lalibela temples, which

01:10:33.517 --> 01:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
are gigantic mountains that were
carved from the outside going

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
in to create this
gigantic temple complex.

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
There's another one
duplicated just like it

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.900 align:middle line:84%
in India called the
Kailash Temples.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go to both and
document both technologies that

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.310 align:middle line:90%
were used to make those.

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
However, in Ethiopia, you
have the original Jews there.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And they have the original
Torah and the original temples,

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and the original story
about the Merkaba,

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.880 align:middle line:90%
which is this star tetrahedron.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
What's really ironic
is these people

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
are darker than
this remote control.

01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:06.495 align:middle line:84%
And they still speak
Hebrew to this day

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:08.287 align:middle line:84%
and have the original
documents, as well as

01:11:08.287 --> 01:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
one of the original bibles that
has the book of Enoch in it

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:11.240 align:middle line:90%
as well.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:12.907 align:middle line:84%
One of the very few
bibles that actually

01:11:12.907 --> 01:11:14.500 align:middle line:90%
contains the book of Enoch.

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the other
books, of course,

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
have eliminated
the book of Enoch.

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The Dogon tribe out
of Mali, Africa,

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.800 align:middle line:84%
they were the original
inhabitants of the land of Kem.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And they had interacted
directly with the Nommo, who

01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.510 align:middle line:84%
came from Sirius
B, a star system

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:31.750 align:middle line:84%
that we just learned to see
in the 1970s with technology

01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.220 align:middle line:90%
through observatories.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And they learned about
the moving stars.

01:11:36.370 --> 01:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
They learned about every planet
in our solar system, the shape,

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:41.008 align:middle line:90%
the sizes, and the colors.

01:11:41.008 --> 01:11:42.550 align:middle line:84%
They learned about
other star systems

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.230 align:middle line:90%
as well from these Nommo.

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And they kept it
in their traditions

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
and handed it down for
thousands of years.

01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
amazing what they

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
were able to acquire,
this information.

01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
This information is still
kept to this very day.

01:11:56.770 --> 01:12:01.192 align:middle line:84%
The area that I went to just
a few weeks ago in Australia--

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
I was out in the
bush in Australia,

01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:04.870 align:middle line:84%
about eight miles
out into the bush,

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and I went there to
document this place that

01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:11.320 align:middle line:84%
had proto-Egyptian hieroglyphs
out in the middle of Australia.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And the name of the
place is the same name

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
as the original settlement
for the Dogon in Mali, Africa.

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
They gave the place
the same name.

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
These settlers gave the
place the same exact name

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
as an ancient name
for the Dogon.

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.122 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
really interesting.

01:12:26.122 --> 01:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you had
the proto-Sumerian

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.360 align:middle line:90%
verified by scholars.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Proto-Sumerian etched into stone
at this makeshift temple way

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.970 align:middle line:90%
out in the bush in Australia.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So I went out there, because
the fires were there, obviously.

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And one site got
destroyed, unfortunately.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:45.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a site with
8,000-year-old cave paintings.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:47.362 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
documented properly.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, I have to
definitely make it out here.

01:12:49.570 --> 01:12:50.860 align:middle line:90%
So I got out there.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I took a good crew,
some really good guides,

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:55.360 align:middle line:84%
indigenous guides, trained
guides that know the area,

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.782 align:middle line:90%
know to respect the land.

01:12:56.782 --> 01:12:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And we went out, and we
documented these hieroglyphs.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.890 align:middle line:90%
So I'm working on it.

01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Gosford
Glyph Documentary."

01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And it should be coming out
probably in about two months.

01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So we've been investigating
the Dogon's adinkra art.

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this adinkra
art, when you take it

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:15.520 align:middle line:84%
from a two-dimensional look into
a three-dimensional platform,

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes something
totally different.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.072 align:middle line:84%
So James S. Gates,
Professor James S. Gates

01:13:21.072 --> 01:13:23.530 align:middle line:84%
at the university-- he was with
the University of Maryland.

01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:25.420 align:middle line:90%
He's somewhere else now.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
But he was a former scientific
advisor to Obama, actually.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He's a theoretical physicist
and an expert in supersymmetry.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
He put together a super
team of scientists.

01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that these
adinkra codes are actually

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.120 align:middle line:84%
something called
error-correcting codes

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.135 align:middle line:90%
in modern science.

01:13:41.135 --> 01:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And these error-correcting
codes are the same exact codes

01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that run search engines,
browsers, and websites.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered that
the ether of spacetime

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:49.510 align:middle line:90%
runs off adinkra codes.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're living
in a realm that's

01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:55.780 align:middle line:84%
governed by program codes
that work on your computers.

01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.885 align:middle line:90%
Of course, as above, so below.

01:13:57.885 --> 01:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Something I brought
up yesterday.

01:13:59.260 --> 01:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
to understand

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
from an advanced being level,
understanding how powerful this

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is that electrons orbit
the nucleus of an atom,

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and planets orbit their suns.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And because an electron
is conscious-- we

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.090 align:middle line:84%
know this from the
double slit experiment--

01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
we must assume then that
planets are also conscious.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is also taken into
consideration by the Ancients

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:26.720 align:middle line:90%
with their technology.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.762 align:middle line:84%
If you look at Ancient
technology from these

01:14:28.762 --> 01:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
into Anunnaki Atlantean
people, it always

01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.860 align:middle line:90%
integrated with nature.

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You never-- you
don't see structures

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
that we build in ancient times.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
They built things that
literally molded in or meshed in

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.060 align:middle line:84%
or worked directly with
nature, like the Great Pyramid

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.910 align:middle line:84%
being a gigantic power
generator of many things, just

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.230 align:middle line:90%
one of many things.

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But built on top of an
aquifer in a way that

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
allowed it to extract
physio-static electricity

01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:55.288 align:middle line:84%
from the moving water
underneath the pyramid,

01:14:55.288 --> 01:14:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and moving it into
different chambers

01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to create this electricity,
this wireless electricity

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:01.540 align:middle line:84%
able to come through
the capstone.

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
So they understood that the
planets were living beings.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.350 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to harness the
energy from these beings,

01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and harness the energy
from their power, their ley

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
lines, and their energy sources,
where the magnetic would lay.

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
important to understand

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that if an electron is
conscious, so is a planet.

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the atomic
structure of gold, which

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
is Au on the periodic
table of elements,

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
you see that it's a Merkaba.

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Being that gold is
a technological device.

01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
A technological
element, I should say.

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.150 align:middle line:90%
So you need gold for technology.

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Without gold, technology
is seriously lacking.

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:42.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, space
travel, you have

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
to have microchips that
are radiation hardened,

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
but they are running
on gold circuit boards.

01:15:48.370 --> 01:15:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about
gold is when you

01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
have a gold strand, you
put energy on the one end,

01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
you get 100% energy
out on the other end.

01:15:54.940 --> 01:15:56.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't lose
anything in friction.

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
silver as well.

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Like if you have a virus, you
could put a drop of silver

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:02.430 align:middle line:90%
on it.

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:03.340 align:middle line:90%
It will kill a virus.

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
It destroys its
replication capabilities.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:09.030 align:middle line:90%
And gold is a great reflector.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you see
it on space helmets.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And you see it
also on satellites.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.410 align:middle line:90%
You see it everywhere.

01:16:14.410 --> 01:16:15.597 align:middle line:90%
And that whole We Buy Gold.

01:16:15.597 --> 01:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Remember, We Buy Gold, We
Buy Gold was everywhere.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.720 align:middle line:84%
At one time, it was like
every corner, We Buy Gold,

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:20.520 align:middle line:90%
We Buy Gold.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
People standing
outside with signs.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.620 align:middle line:90%
That was a government program.

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it was a
government program.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.288 align:middle line:90%
The government was behind it.

01:16:27.288 --> 01:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
It's well doc--
anybody can look it up.

01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:31.570 align:middle line:84%
They were trying to reacquire
massive amounts of gold.

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:34.468 align:middle line:84%
And they reacquired
millions of tons of gold.

01:16:34.468 --> 01:16:36.760 align:middle line:10%
So now we're going to talk
a little bit about the ankh,

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.950 align:middle line:10%
and the importance of the ankh.

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:41.770 align:middle line:10%
This symbol has got
multiple meanings,

01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:45.730 align:middle line:10%
but it's heavily involved
in star gate travel.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.200 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people
didn't know that.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:51.190 align:middle line:10%
We've kind of taken it now
to be it's cool jewelry.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:52.770 align:middle line:10%
It's nice to wear.

01:16:52.770 --> 01:16:54.430 align:middle line:10%
It's got an ankh on
instead of a cross.

01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:55.513 align:middle line:10%
Whatever your beliefs are.

01:16:55.513 --> 01:16:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's a cool thing
to have right now.

01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And just like how we would
mine gold for the Anunnaki,

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and then we took on gold
as a decorative value.

01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
Even till this
very day, we revere

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.655 align:middle line:84%
gold for decoration versus
they were using it for-- now,

01:17:11.655 --> 01:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
you need to get that gold
out of the ground for us,

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.370 align:middle line:84%
because we're going to
use it for technology.

01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:16.640 align:middle line:90%
You can use it for decoration.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.605 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make you
think it's important.

01:17:18.605 --> 01:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
In the book of Enoch,
you find this out

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:21.610 align:middle line:84%
when they come down
and teach people

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:23.902 align:middle line:84%
how to make jewelry from the
gold and things like that,

01:17:23.902 --> 01:17:26.080 align:middle line:84%
how to electroplate it,
and make themselves pretty,

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and put on makeup and
all this other stuff.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.655 align:middle line:84%
They were like, we'll,
just wishy wash them

01:17:31.655 --> 01:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
with that part of it.

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take it and
use it for technology.

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Make them vain, and they'll
get caught up in that.

01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:38.860 align:middle line:90%
And it worked.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
So of course, the ankh
has several meanings.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
The first, of course, is
it's the womb of mankind.

01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:46.990 align:middle line:84%
You have the uterus,
the womb of life.

01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:50.350 align:middle line:84%
In that top circle would
be the fetus, actually.

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And it also represents sunrise
and sunset, the solstices,

01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
the Fallopian tubes,
and the vaginal canal,

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.420 align:middle line:90%
where life comes.

01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.520 align:middle line:90%
All life comes out of a womb.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Feminine energy.

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
You also have to realize that
the ankh itself is also--

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
a human reproductive system
is reverse of the ankh,

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or reverse of the
human-- the female womb.

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.548 align:middle line:84%
So everybody-- all life
starts as a female.

01:18:19.548 --> 01:18:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you knew that,
but all life starts as female.

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:23.548 align:middle line:84%
And then based on
your chromosomes,

01:18:23.548 --> 01:18:25.150 align:middle line:90%
you could develop into a male.

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the uterus
and you look at the male,

01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:31.330 align:middle line:90%
you see that the ovaries drop.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And the uterus inverts,
becomes a penis,

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and the birth canal becomes
the other part of the-- you

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.200 align:middle line:90%
can just see this.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously just reversed.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It's an inside out female
reproductive system

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:47.800 align:middle line:84%
is what we men have pretty
much, to be honest with you.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.978 align:middle line:90%
But it goes deeper than that.

01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It goes deeper than that.

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at the
scientific part of this.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.533 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to start
off with Nikola Tesla.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
We might know this guy here.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
He's a little bit famous now
for the conscious community.

01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We finally brought him
to his full stature

01:19:05.390 --> 01:19:08.550 align:middle line:84%
as a famous inventor
and a powerful person

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:09.870 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient past.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla rediscovered the
power of the djed pillar ankh.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
These oscillators are
expressly intended

01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:17.190 align:middle line:84%
to operate on direct and
alternating lightning circuits,

01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and to generate damped
and undamped oscillations

01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
or currents at any frequency,
the volume and tension

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
within its widest limits.

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And they are compact,
self-contained,

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.530 align:middle line:10%
require no care for
long periods of time,

01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:30.630 align:middle line:10%
and will be found very
convenient and useful

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:34.620 align:middle line:10%
for various purposes as wireless
telegraphy and telephony,

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.660 align:middle line:10%
conversion of electrical
energy, formation

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.660 align:middle line:10%
of chemical compounds
through fusion,

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.950 align:middle line:10%
and a combination of
synthesis and gases,

01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:44.780 align:middle line:10%
manufacture of ozone, lightning,
welding, municipal hospital

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.790 align:middle line:10%
can use it, domestic
sanitation and sterilization,

01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:50.520 align:middle line:10%
and numerous other applications
in scientific laboratories

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.063 align:middle line:10%
and industrial institutions.

01:19:52.063 --> 01:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
While these transformers have
never been described before,

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:56.430 align:middle line:84%
the general principles
underlying them

01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
were fully set fourth in Tesla's
published articles of patents,

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:03.273 align:middle line:84%
more particularly those
of September 22, 1896.

01:20:03.273 --> 01:20:04.440 align:middle line:90%
So what is he talking about?

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.732 align:middle line:90%
What are we talking about here?

01:20:05.732 --> 01:20:08.097 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the Tesla coil.

01:20:08.097 --> 01:20:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a quick
look at the Tesla coil

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and what it does.

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we're
going to see how it

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.030 align:middle line:84%
combines with the ankh
from ancient times.

01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:16.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The gist of the Tesla
coils, we're taking energy from

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.470 align:middle line:10%
the wall, and we're
taking a low voltage,

01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:20.970 align:middle line:10%
and we're stepping it up with
a transformer to a really high

01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:21.770 align:middle line:10%
voltage.

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a reverse of what a
normal transformer would do

01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:24.550 align:middle line:90%
from a power line.

01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:26.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a transformer
can go either way.

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
They'll either step down
voltage, or step it up.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.400 align:middle line:90%
These step it up.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
What makes a Tesla coil
what it is specifically

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:33.640 align:middle line:90%
is this coil right here.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
This is the secondary coil.

01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:36.397 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
it's special is

01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:37.650 align:middle line:10%
because it's a tuned circuit.

01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:39.442 align:middle line:10%
So that means that
every time we put energy

01:20:39.442 --> 01:20:41.640 align:middle line:10%
into it at its
resonant frequency,

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.460 align:middle line:10%
the voltage at the top load
becomes higher, and higher,

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:46.920 align:middle line:10%
and higher until
eventually it gets so high

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.020 align:middle line:10%
that it just wants to jump
right out of the toroid

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:50.145 align:middle line:10%
through our breakout point.

01:20:50.145 --> 01:20:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And so these Tesla coils
are a little bit special.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.922 align:middle line:84%
They're not like
the Tesla coils that

01:20:53.922 --> 01:20:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Tesla himself used to make.

01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for
that is that they

01:20:56.670 --> 01:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
use solid state parts, so like
transistors, and components,

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and things that weren't
around in his day.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
And so this machine is
more similar to what

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.400 align:middle line:84%
we would know now as a
switched mode power supply,

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
or sort of like a
motor controller.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So down here in
this box, you see

01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
we have DC voltage that comes
in from our power supply.

01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have a bank of
transistors in here.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And we also have a
bank of capacitors

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
that's hooked in series with
this primary coil right here.

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
what we're doing

01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
is we're using those transistors
to switch the current

01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:29.610 align:middle line:90%
across this tank circuit.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And we're creating a really
high voltage on this primary.

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And we're transferring energy
into the secondary coil

01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:37.345 align:middle line:90%
at its resonant frequency.

01:21:37.345 --> 01:21:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The primary coil
and secondary coil,

01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:40.075 align:middle line:90%
how are they connected?

01:21:40.075 --> 01:21:40.950 align:middle line:90%
How do they interact?

01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.635 align:middle line:84%
So they're actually
not connected.

01:21:42.635 --> 01:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
doing here is we're

01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.140 align:middle line:84%
creating a current on
this primary coil, which

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:48.180 align:middle line:90%
ends up creating magnetic flux.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And that magnetic
flux ends up getting

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.250 align:middle line:84%
coupled to the secondary, just
like a standard transformer.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And then in terms of scale,
what's different between

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.110 align:middle line:84%
a small Tesla coil
and a bigger one?

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And how do you get to
a big size Tesla coil?

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say that the
key difference--

01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot of
little differences--

01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:06.300 align:middle line:84%
but the key difference is the
size of the silicon that you

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.550 align:middle line:90%
need to make a big Tesla coil.

01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> The solid state.

01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.840 align:middle line:90%
A big solid state coil.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.292 align:middle line:84%
And so a big solid state coil
like this uses a transistor.

01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a transistor?

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That looks like that.

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about the
size of your fist,

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.410 align:middle line:90%
probably a little bit heavier.

01:22:17.410 --> 01:22:18.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A small Tesla coil will use
a transistor sort of like that.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That looks a
little more familiar.

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:22.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:23.160 align:middle line:90%
>> On the circuit board.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.047 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

01:22:24.047 --> 01:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And so there's some
differences in the electronics

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that you need to drive
something this large.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.670 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, that's mainly it.

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
One of these guys
costs about $400.

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have several of
those in this bank right here.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.248 align:middle line:84%
And one of these guys
right here is probably $8.

01:22:38.248 --> 01:22:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> So you can make one at home.

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can
make one at home.

01:22:41.427 --> 01:22:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So electricity goes up.

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:43.380 align:middle line:90%
It's high voltage.

01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Very high frequency as well.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this thing oscillates
at about 40 kilohertz.

01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:48.930 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And then once it gets to
the top, what happens?

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So the top load right
here is a capacitor.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And so basically it changes
the resonant frequency

01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.590 align:middle line:90%
of the secondary coil.

01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it also helps us
store more energy.

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one of
the interesting things

01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:04.950 align:middle line:90%
about Tesla coils.

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:06.450 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
you don't see them

01:23:06.450 --> 01:23:09.630 align:middle line:84%
everywhere is because they're
notorious for interfering

01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:11.030 align:middle line:84%
with nearby
electronic equipment.

01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:12.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you install
it on a stage,

01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:15.510 align:middle line:84%
it can make your lights blink,
and it can make your mixing

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:16.620 align:middle line:90%
consoles crackle.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason
why a Tesla coil

01:23:18.450 --> 01:23:20.280 align:middle line:84%
interferes with
other electronics

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:22.330 align:middle line:84%
is because of this
top load up here.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And so this is a capacitor.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.440 align:middle line:84%
It's about 40 picofarad, which
is not a lot of capacitance.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.190 align:middle line:84%
But if you consider
that we're charging it

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:32.000 align:middle line:84%
up to half a million volts, it's
holding a whole lot of energy.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.140 align:middle line:10%
>> And so when the arc arcs out
of the toroid and it strikes

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.000 align:middle line:10%
a ground point, what happens
is the energy in this top load

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.490 align:middle line:10%
and top load capacitance
discharges through the arc,

01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:44.640 align:middle line:10%
and it creates a really,
really high current surge.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.040 align:middle line:10%
And it makes a
huge burst of EMI.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.630 align:middle line:10%
And it rings the ground
lines and stuff like that.

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why we developed
this piece right here.

01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what this piece is, it's
basically just an inductor.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And so we're using
it as a reactor.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So essentially what it's
doing is it's slowing down--

01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember that shape
that you just saw.

01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:middle line:10%
>> The rate that the energy
is allowed to discharge out

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.950 align:middle line:10%
of the top load.

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And so when the Tesla coil
strikes to a grounded object,

01:24:08.490 --> 01:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
the current doesn't
peak nearly as high.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:14.418 align:middle line:90%
>> So by oscillating--

01:24:14.418 --> 01:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
we were talking about
oscillation earlier--

01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
they're oscillating the
frequency in the Tesla coil

01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and creating these bursts
at a particular hertz.

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.090 align:middle line:90%
You get music.

01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:26.190 align:middle line:90%
You get sound.

01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>> The gist of a Tesla--

01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But what's important about
that is it's part of the djed

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.020 align:middle line:90%
pillar.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:34.870 align:middle line:90%
So now you look at the Ancients.

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
djed pillar ankh.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the one on the
top left is the one

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.990 align:middle line:84%
underneath the temple
of Dendera in Egypt,

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:44.680 align:middle line:84%
which I've been to,
underground crypt.

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's etched into these
magnetic granite walls

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom
underneath that crypt.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.640 align:middle line:84%
You can see it looks like
a light bulb connected

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to a djed pillar.

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:56.130 align:middle line:84%
The djed pillar, as you can
just see from the Tesla coil,

01:24:56.130 --> 01:24:59.530 align:middle line:84%
the djed transmits
wireless electricity,

01:24:59.530 --> 01:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
which was picked up by
this light bulb technology

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.770 align:middle line:90%
that they had.

01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:04.187 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
reason why when you

01:25:04.187 --> 01:25:06.610 align:middle line:84%
go into these ancient
sites, you don't

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
see any soot in the ceiling of
these crypts, and these places.

01:25:10.710 --> 01:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
have torches.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:13.870 align:middle line:90%
They had no torches.

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:15.630 align:middle line:90%
They had light bulbs.

01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you look here at the
bottom, you see these djeds.

01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:20.110 align:middle line:90%
And you see these ankhs.

01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.050 align:middle line:90%
You see here Pakistan, Egypt.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.050 align:middle line:84%
They all had djed pillars
and they had the ankh.

01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one in the
middle is a combination

01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of the induction coils, the
copper windings, the bar

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.650 align:middle line:84%
magnet, and everything
combined into an actual ankh.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen in ancient
times, the kings, the elites,

01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
the pharaohs, the
queens, whoever

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
had a ranking high enough
to go through these portals

01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:45.757 align:middle line:84%
to get to other places,
very, very few people.

01:25:45.757 --> 01:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Because when you look
into the ancient text,

01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
you see that some people
had access to the portals,

01:25:50.230 --> 01:25:51.940 align:middle line:84%
and some people
had to get on ships

01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and do rendezvous with planets.

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.560 align:middle line:84%
That's in the Enuma Elis, the
Seven Temples of Creation,

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the Atrahasis Epic,
the Mahabharata.

01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You look at texts, which we'll
go into here, from Enlil.

01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:04.960 align:middle line:84%
He created this place
called a Bond Heaven-Earth,

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
or Dur-An-Ki, that allowed
him to walk from Earth

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.947 align:middle line:90%
directly to his home planet.

01:26:09.947 --> 01:26:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But only specific people had
the capability of doing it.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And you had to have
this in your hand.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So the ankh was specifically
this kind of ankh,

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:21.550 align:middle line:84%
this djed pillar ankh was
specifically for the kings

01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:23.830 align:middle line:84%
that people had the
ability to access.

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:26.380 align:middle line:84%
So it was a
combination of this was

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:30.250 align:middle line:84%
the resonant frequency of your
atomic structure of your body.

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:32.380 align:middle line:84%
If it didn't match you,
you couldn't walk through.

01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.370 align:middle line:90%
You'd be killed.

01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It also allowed the combination
of this data storage capacity

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
to unlock, the quantum
computing to work out,

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and everything else was
used by this condenser,

01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:44.620 align:middle line:90%
by this djed pillar ankh.

01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:48.080 align:middle line:90%


01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Tesla
coil that Tesla created.

01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And you can see he
obviously tapped

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
into ancient
Egyptian technology,

01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:57.680 align:middle line:84%
because this information
is very, very ancient.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not brand new.

01:26:59.570 --> 01:27:02.753 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
what the ancients

01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:03.920 align:middle line:90%
would carry to walk through.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.630 align:middle line:90%
It was part of the key.

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And it had to match
your frequency.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of us
has an atomic frequency

01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:10.820 align:middle line:84%
that's different
than every-- it's

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
a fingerprint, your fingerprint,
everybody's got a fingerprint.

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, certain atoms resonate
at specific frequencies

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.570 align:middle line:90%
within a range.

01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And we know those ranges.

01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
But overall, every single
person in this room

01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:25.760 align:middle line:84%
resonates at a slightly
different frequency range.

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:29.095 align:middle line:84%
And that frequency range is your
atomic frequency fingerprint.

01:27:29.095 --> 01:27:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
would do is they

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:33.080 align:middle line:84%
would match these djed pillar
ankhs to your frequency,

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.400 align:middle line:90%
and that would be your key.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.950 align:middle line:10%
So the djed symbol is also
sometimes viewed as a pillar

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:38.360 align:middle line:10%
supporting the sky.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.160 align:middle line:10%
The djed symbol is
also used in ceremony

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.930 align:middle line:10%
called raising the djed.

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.580 align:middle line:10%
This ceremony is
meant to represent

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:45.710 align:middle line:10%
Osiris's triumph over Set.

01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:48.020 align:middle line:10%
During the ceremony,
the pharaoh uses a rope

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.570 align:middle line:10%
to place a pillar with the
assistance of a priest.

01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:53.390 align:middle line:84%
The djed has also been
used as an amulet placed

01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:55.550 align:middle line:84%
near the spines of
mummified bodies,

01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:58.010 align:middle line:84%
and the image painted
on their coffin.

01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:59.720 align:middle line:10%
Numerous hieroglyphic
inscriptions,

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.150 align:middle line:10%
architectural structures
integrate the djed,

01:28:02.150 --> 01:28:04.910 align:middle line:10%
therefore hinting it is of
great importance and sacredness

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:06.560 align:middle line:10%
for the ancient Egyptians.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:09.950 align:middle line:10%
This is a real important
piece of technology right here

01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:13.670 align:middle line:10%
that has been clearly put out in
all the glyphs all over Egypt.

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And it's showing you tech.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:17.920 align:middle line:10%
This is not like reeds
and bamboo strips.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It's real technology.

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:21.940 align:middle line:90%
So you look at the ankh.

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And you look at the djed.

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.450 align:middle line:90%
And look at modern technology.

01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:28.650 align:middle line:90%
You see the similarities here.

01:28:28.650 --> 01:28:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So right outside on the
electric poles outside,

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
the same exact setup.

01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:39.070 align:middle line:84%
We're using the technology
of the ancients today.

01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:41.590 align:middle line:10%
Just an AC/DC current.

01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:42.790 align:middle line:10%
This is Ptah Noster.

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:45.080 align:middle line:90%
That's actually Enki.

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can go see him in
the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's the one who
wrote the Lord's Prayer.

01:28:50.290 --> 01:28:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Enki's Prayer is
really the name of it.

01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
It's Enki's Prayer,
the Ptah Noster.

01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:56.657 align:middle line:84%
It was later transferred into
Latin, and then into English.

01:28:56.657 --> 01:28:59.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, "Our father who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Thy kingdom come as it is on
Earth, as it is in heaven.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.517 align:middle line:10%
Thy will--", you know.

01:29:02.517 --> 01:29:04.390 align:middle line:10%
All that come from
the Ptah Noster.

01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the lord's
prayer by Enki.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But you see what he
has in his hands.

01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:09.400 align:middle line:90%
He's got the djed.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:11.200 align:middle line:84%
That's his star gate
key right there.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:15.050 align:middle line:90%


01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So this djed was set
to the atomic resonance

01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:19.153 align:middle line:90%
frequency of the human body.

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:21.320 align:middle line:84%
And they had the capability
of calculating that just

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.180 align:middle line:90%
as we do now in modern times.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So here are the
frequencies right here.

01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
This isn't even-- this
is peer-reviewed science.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:28.780 align:middle line:90%
We know the frequencies.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.670 align:middle line:84%
We know the resonant
frequencies.

01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can easily program
a technological device

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to resonate or match
these frequencies,

01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:38.830 align:middle line:90%
and make it coherent.

01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Today, in today's
modern technology,

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.232 align:middle line:84%
we have this
capability right now.

01:29:42.232 --> 01:29:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
exact frequencies

01:29:43.690 --> 01:29:46.410 align:middle line:90%
coming out of modern science.

01:29:46.410 --> 01:29:50.940 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
frequency and resonance.

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.190 align:middle line:90%
This is Hebrew right here.

01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
This is going into
the tetragrammaton.

01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So not only can
the Hebrew letters

01:29:58.050 --> 01:29:59.590 align:middle line:84%
become three
dimensional structures,

01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
but when you look at the
YHWH, which is really

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.090 align:middle line:84%
almost impossible
truly to pronounce,

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:11.220 align:middle line:84%
but we call it Yahweh, you see
how it builds a human body.

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And this was known
by the Ancients,

01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that this particular code, which
is embedded into the human DNA

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:23.490 align:middle line:84%
structure, is what they
utilized to identify the god

01:30:23.490 --> 01:30:25.140 align:middle line:90%
man, or the spiritual man.

01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And it would match it then
with these frequencies.

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.690 align:middle line:90%
And what are we talking about?

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:32.455 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about 666.

01:30:32.455 --> 01:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
The human avatar
bodies are pretty much

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:36.360 align:middle line:84%
built of a lattice of
carbon-12 isotope, which

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.170 align:middle line:84%
is built from six protons, six
electrons, and six neutrons.

01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:44.430 align:middle line:84%
The isotope of carbon accounts
for 99% of all forms of carbon.

01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:46.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the isotope
carbon, which is

01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.410 align:middle line:84%
12, consists of six electrons,
six protons, and six neutrons,

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:50.910 align:middle line:90%
which is 666.

01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:54.030 align:middle line:84%
After oxygen, the most abundant
element in the human body,

01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:55.440 align:middle line:90%
is carbon-12.

01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.010 align:middle line:84%
On cremation of the body, it
returns to its carbon-12 state

01:30:59.010 --> 01:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
after all gases, like oxygen,
helium, hydrogen, are released.

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Carbon-12 is one of
the five elements

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.120 align:middle line:90%
that make up the human DNA.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Carbon-12 is the
most crucial isotope

01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:10.440 align:middle line:90%
needed to create a living body.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what
the writer of Revelation

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:17.160 align:middle line:84%
was referring to when he said
666 was the number of a man.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, why was 666 demonized?

01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It was very crucial and
important to understand

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:27.120 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times that this was
the isotopes and the carbon

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and protons were very
important to star gate travel.

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's
important to them,

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:37.560 align:middle line:90%
they make it unimportant to us.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.090 align:middle line:84%
We can't be allowed
to know this.

01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This is-- ooh, this
is spooky stuff.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Don't mess with this.

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
666 has nothing to do
with demons, and dragons,

01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and devils, and all this
other kind of stuff.

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Hell is just a state of
mind, my personal opinion.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.333 align:middle line:10%
So there's one
video I want to get

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:56.500 align:middle line:10%
to before we-- because we're
getting a little close,

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.230 align:middle line:10%
then I'm going to go back here.

01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:01.640 align:middle line:10%
Let me stop here real quick.

01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:04.150 align:middle line:10%
The DNA is composed of four
elements, hydrogen, nitrogen,

01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:07.990 align:middle line:10%
oxygen, carbon, and when
put together form Y-H-W-G.

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:11.170 align:middle line:10%
Carbon is what makes us
a physical earthly being.

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:12.820 align:middle line:10%
When carbon is
replaced with nitrogen,

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.850 align:middle line:10%
we have all colorless and
odorless invisible gases.

01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:19.600 align:middle line:10%
And they form the letters Y-H,
also known as, obviously, Yah.

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.400 align:middle line:10%
This is encoded into your DNA.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:25.120 align:middle line:10%
The name of God is
encoded into your DNA.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.418 align:middle line:10%
So this is a fact.

01:32:26.418 --> 01:32:27.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is nothing--

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.377 align:middle line:10%
you can't escape this.

01:32:28.377 --> 01:32:30.890 align:middle line:10%
This is real science.

01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:34.330 align:middle line:10%
So this is how the name
got into religious text.

01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:35.350 align:middle line:10%
It's in the DNA.

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:38.800 align:middle line:10%
It's on the genetic level,
meaning that we are gods.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.300 align:middle line:10%
Literally, we are gods.

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:43.450 align:middle line:10%
The power of creation, the
power of the divine energy

01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:45.370 align:middle line:10%
and the spark is
inside of our bodies,

01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:47.410 align:middle line:10%
just as it is in all
of creation as well.

01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:49.690 align:middle line:10%
And we have the capability
of tapping into that.

01:32:49.690 --> 01:32:51.648 align:middle line:10%
Another thing that they
don't want you to know.

01:32:51.648 --> 01:32:54.075 align:middle line:10%
So they keep you afraid
of thinking you have power

01:32:54.075 --> 01:32:56.200 align:middle line:10%
so that you can feel like
you have to beg for help,

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.890 align:middle line:10%
instead of understanding that
the help comes from within.

01:32:58.890 --> 01:33:01.240 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want to show
you a few of these.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.000 align:middle line:10%
Right here, we have the
chariot-- this is from Enlil

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.267 align:middle line:10%
from the Sumerian tablets.

01:33:05.267 --> 01:33:06.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
read the whole thing,

01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:09.142 align:middle line:10%
because I want to show you
some of these other portals.

01:33:09.142 --> 01:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
But he basically says that he's
going to build a star gate here

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.150 align:middle line:84%
to walk from one
world to another.

01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And the quote is,
"A chariot place

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.860 align:middle line:10%
I shall henceforth
build from Nibiru

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.887 align:middle line:10%
to Earth directly to arrive."

01:33:23.887 --> 01:33:25.720 align:middle line:84%
The way that they talked
in Sumerian tablets

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:26.680 align:middle line:90%
was always like Yoda.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I think they took the Yoda
dialect from the Sumerian

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.770 align:middle line:84%
tablets, because they always
talk in that reverse talk.

01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:36.317 align:middle line:84%
But as you can see, he's
talking about building this.

01:33:36.317 --> 01:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
First, he's talking
about establishing

01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:40.960 align:middle line:84%
a city in a circle that
radiates out in terms

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.235 align:middle line:90%
of the distance, all the--

01:33:42.235 --> 01:33:44.110 align:middle line:84%
everything would be
exactly the same distance

01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.190 align:middle line:90%
away from each other.

01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And then he talks about
building this chariot place,

01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:52.300 align:middle line:84%
called Dur-An-Ki, which allows
human beings, or these gods,

01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I guess, these Anunnaki
elites to walk directly

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:57.100 align:middle line:90%
back to their home planet.

01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a Sumerian
cylinder seal.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:02.590 align:middle line:10%
I believe this one is in the--

01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:04.793 align:middle line:10%
this picture is taken of
the Sumerian cylinder seal.

01:34:04.793 --> 01:34:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Where is this located?

01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:07.540 align:middle line:10%
I think this is in
the British Museum.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.940 align:middle line:10%
But this is actually Enlil.

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:12.070 align:middle line:10%
So you see the
guards at the gate.

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And this is Enlil walking
through a star gate.

01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:17.950 align:middle line:10%
So these gates are
always guarded.

01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:18.760 align:middle line:10%
And this is Enlil.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Enlil is the brother of Enki.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of the very first
of the Sumerian--

01:34:24.130 --> 01:34:26.380 align:middle line:84%
or according to
Sumerian mythology,

01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the Anunnaki pantheon to
arrive here on planet Earth,

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:32.170 align:middle line:84%
their names are mentioned
in the Enuma Elis, and also

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:34.570 align:middle line:84%
the Atrahasis Epic,
which pre-date

01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of modern authors,
including even Zecharia

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Sitchin.

01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:40.330 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't even born when
this stuff was translated.

01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:43.740 align:middle line:10%
But this is very ancient,
an ancient Sumerian cylinder

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:47.140 align:middle line:10%
scroll that was discovered in
Iraq, along with over 1 million

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:49.360 align:middle line:10%
other scrolls and texts.

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.540 align:middle line:10%
And this depicts one
of these Anunnaki gods

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:54.025 align:middle line:10%
walking through a star gate.

01:34:54.025 --> 01:34:55.330 align:middle line:10%
>> A million other--

01:34:55.330 --> 01:34:56.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, a million.

01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:57.130 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:34:57.130 --> 01:34:57.990 align:middle line:10%
Got you.

01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:59.820 align:middle line:90%
This is really amazing.

01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there's so many of this.

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.430 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
data and content.

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't even gone through
a third of the tablets yet.

01:35:08.130 --> 01:35:10.640 align:middle line:90%
There's so much more to go.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I told you about
earlier, this chariot place

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:17.810 align:middle line:84%
that they built.
And this is Ninurta.

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:20.490 align:middle line:10%
This is another
famous image here.

01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:24.770 align:middle line:10%
Ninurta is actually
opening up a gate.

01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is Ninurta
opening the gate here.

01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:29.210 align:middle line:10%
So this relief in
the British Museum

01:35:29.210 --> 01:35:31.850 align:middle line:10%
shows the Sumerian god
Ninurta in a gateway, which

01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:34.970 align:middle line:10%
is a star gate, using his
index finger to push something

01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:35.840 align:middle line:10%
on the wall.

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.760 align:middle line:10%
He wears two wrist devices.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.950 align:middle line:10%
The emblem around his
neck matches the design

01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:41.457 align:middle line:10%
of the Kings Templar--

01:35:41.457 --> 01:35:42.290 align:middle line:10%
the Knights Templar.

01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:43.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's also similar to the
radiation symbol, obviously.

01:35:47.630 --> 01:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So you see this cross
in ancient times

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.920 align:middle line:84%
long before the
Christ even existed.

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.620 align:middle line:84%
This cross, which is
also in Coptic Cairo,

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:57.470 align:middle line:84%
is represented many
places throughout Cairo.

01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:59.780 align:middle line:10%
But it also resembles
the radiation symbol

01:35:59.780 --> 01:36:02.390 align:middle line:10%
and the Knights Templar cross.

01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.490 align:middle line:10%
And also, of course,
Nibiru was known

01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:07.375 align:middle line:10%
as the planet of the
crossing in ancient texts.

01:36:07.375 --> 01:36:08.500 align:middle line:10%
So it's really interesting.

01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.730 align:middle line:10%
But you can see
here that he appears

01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:13.370 align:middle line:10%
to be entering this gate.

01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And these key pieces
here are showing--

01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:18.800 align:middle line:84%
whatever is in his
hand, you've got

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access it
through whatever kind of code

01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:22.490 align:middle line:90%
or whatever he's pushing on.

01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:25.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these gates
that have been discovered

01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:28.340 align:middle line:84%
seem to have these
little notches in them

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.940 align:middle line:90%
where something goes into them.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of interesting.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:35.060 align:middle line:10%
This is the Ziggurat
of Ur in Iraq.

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:37.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, this picture-- I have
more pictures than this.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:39.980 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to show any
of the soldiers faces,

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:42.560 align:middle line:10%
but in the other, on my Facebook
group, Anunnaki History,

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.630 align:middle line:10%
the pictures were given
to me by an actual friend

01:36:44.630 --> 01:36:48.350 align:middle line:10%
of mine, who was part of
this group of soldiers.

01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:51.140 align:middle line:10%
But for TV purposes,
I chose the ones

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.063 align:middle line:10%
with them going up
and only the tank.

01:36:53.063 --> 01:36:54.980 align:middle line:10%
But if you go to Anunnaki
History on Facebook,

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:57.500 align:middle line:10%
you'll see their faces, and
you'll see many more photos.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.670 align:middle line:10%
When the 9/11 incident
happened and we

01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:03.200 align:middle line:10%
decided that we wanted revenge,
we went straight to Iraq,

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.640 align:middle line:10%
obviously, in 2001.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.320 align:middle line:10%
And where did we go?

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.970 align:middle line:10%
Straight to the Ziggurat of Ur.

01:37:08.970 --> 01:37:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>> And the Antiquities Museum.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.300 align:middle line:10%
>> And the Antiquities Museum.

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:11.840 align:middle line:10%
We went there.

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.310 align:middle line:10%
We blew the doors
off the museum.

01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.950 align:middle line:10%
We went inside, and stole
all the antiquities.

01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:17.760 align:middle line:10%
We went into the deep
cellar area, where

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.880 align:middle line:10%
they had a lot of a
real ancient stuff,

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.580 align:middle line:10%
and stuff that talked
about ancient technology.

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And we, being Americans, we
took that stuff, the military.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:28.310 align:middle line:90%
We went to the Ziggurat of Ur.

01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
was actually there

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.270 align:middle line:90%
when they went in.

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is what they came
out with, this object.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
This is an old photo.

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it was 1920 something,
this photo of these two Arabs

01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:47.157 align:middle line:84%
here with this stone circle,
which kind of resembles a star

01:37:47.157 --> 01:37:48.560 align:middle line:90%
gate circle.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Could the WMD be a star gate?

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Is that what they were after?

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Could it be the...?

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, to throw people
off, in this modern time,

01:37:58.510 --> 01:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
they've taken this image,
and people have photoshopped

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.627 align:middle line:90%
into the image other things.

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:04.960 align:middle line:84%
When you go to the original
source for this image, which

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.520 align:middle line:84%
you can actually use
Google Images to search

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.062 align:middle line:84%
for the original
source, you find out

01:38:08.062 --> 01:38:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that the original image
is this image, not

01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:12.410 align:middle line:90%
anything added to it.

01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:14.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is the original
image right here.

01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And in my personal opinion,
the Ziggurat of Ur mission

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:19.990 align:middle line:10%
was all about going
to get a star gate.

01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:21.070 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to get--

01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:23.622 align:middle line:84%
Saddam Hussein was getting
ready to open his own museum.

01:38:23.622 --> 01:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was going to
open it to the world.

01:38:25.330 --> 01:38:26.788 align:middle line:84%
And he was going
to reveal the star

01:38:26.788 --> 01:38:29.350 align:middle line:84%
gate and all these other
ancient technologies.

01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And the minister of
transportation for Iraq

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:33.670 align:middle line:84%
came forward three
years ago and said

01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:37.030 align:middle line:84%
that Iraq was the original
birthplace for civilization,

01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and the first airport 6,000
years ago for technology

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.160 align:middle line:90%
for flying machines.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And he went public with that.

01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:44.650 align:middle line:90%
You can look it up on Google.

01:38:44.650 --> 01:38:47.500 align:middle line:90%


01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:51.157 align:middle line:84%
Also, this is taken
from Mike Bower's book.

01:38:51.157 --> 01:38:53.740 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know who Mike Bower
is, he's on "Ancient Aliens."

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.030 align:middle line:90%
He's a best-selling author.

01:38:56.030 --> 01:39:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I enhanced this image
from his book for him.

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.150 align:middle line:10%
And this is a Ziggurat
from the Apollo 11 image

01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:09.790 align:middle line:10%
frame, AS11-38-5564, which is
an image from the moon taken

01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:11.140 align:middle line:10%
from the Apollo images.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:15.760 align:middle line:10%
An unobfuscated, unblocked
out, unblotched out image.

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:20.350 align:middle line:10%
And this is a Ziggurat
on the actual moon.

01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:22.330 align:middle line:10%
So could the Ziggurat
of Earth's star gate

01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:26.350 align:middle line:10%
have been linked to a Ziggurat
star gate on the moon?

01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Could they have
traveled back and forth?

01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:30.670 align:middle line:84%
This is Enki's
underwater portal.

01:39:30.670 --> 01:39:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So at the bottom
here, you see Enki.

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:34.150 align:middle line:90%
That's Enlil's brother.

01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:38.410 align:middle line:84%
He's coming from a subwater
base through this portal

01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:40.480 align:middle line:90%
to come up and walk out on land.

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Enki walks out of
the water onto land.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.470 align:middle line:84%
This is also on
display at the museum.

01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And Enki was also known
to the Greeks as Poseidon.

01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So Enki had many names,
just like his brother

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:51.910 align:middle line:90%
had many names.

01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:middle line:84%
His brother, Enlil,
had the name of Yahweh.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.870 align:middle line:84%
In the modern day
Bible he's Yahweh.

01:39:56.870 --> 01:40:00.430 align:middle line:84%
He's also known in ancient texts
as Satan, the Lord of Eden.

01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And Enki is known as Ptah,
where you get the Ptah

01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:05.680 align:middle line:90%
Noster in ancient Egypt.

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:08.380 align:middle line:90%
He's also known as Poseidon.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.490 align:middle line:90%
And of course, Enki.

01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Earth is named after Enki.

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.790 align:middle line:84%
His name is Ea Enki, E-A,
then E-N-K-I. Ki is Earth,

01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and Ea was his first two
initials, or part of his name.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we got the
name Earth, from Enki.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.990 align:middle line:84%
The Earth is actually
named after him.

01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So star gates always
resemble water.

01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:28.778 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of interesting
that he would be Poseidon

01:40:28.778 --> 01:40:30.050 align:middle line:90%
in the control of water.

01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient
Sumerian tablets,

01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:35.330 align:middle line:84%
he said he made his
abode beneath the oceans.

01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:39.377 align:middle line:84%
And kind of a weird place
to want to build your home,

01:40:39.377 --> 01:40:40.460 align:middle line:90%
but that's where he lived.

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.150 align:middle line:90%
He lived underneath the oceans.

01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.158 align:middle line:84%
He actually had some
type of underwater base.

01:40:44.158 --> 01:40:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And he would transfer himself
up and down through this portal

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:48.080 align:middle line:90%
to get back to home.

01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.540 align:middle line:10%
Ironically, when
you think about it,

01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:52.970 align:middle line:10%
could it be that
these star gates--

01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:55.850 align:middle line:10%
maybe he was just a master
of portal technology.

01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:57.680 align:middle line:10%
Because they always
look like water.

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.080 align:middle line:10%
Just kind of a
coincidence, I thought.

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.310 align:middle line:10%
So of course, you
know him as Poseidon.

01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:05.710 align:middle line:10%
At the Great Pyramid
at Giza, there's

01:41:05.710 --> 01:41:07.935 align:middle line:10%
something called
the Halls of Amenti.

01:41:07.935 --> 01:41:09.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Halls of
Amenti can even

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:13.990 align:middle line:10%
be pulled up on Google
location, Google Earth.

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:middle line:84%
You can use any-- you
can even go to Instagram.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Upload an image,
and go to location,

01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:20.180 align:middle line:90%
and type in Halls of Amenti.

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be able
to get the location

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.100 align:middle line:10%
and tag it to your photo.

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.380 align:middle line:90%
The Halls of Amenti is real.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Thoth talked
about it in ancient times.

01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:32.675 align:middle line:84%
And he said that it was
underneath the Great Pyramid,

01:41:32.675 --> 01:41:33.550 align:middle line:90%
one of these portals.

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:35.800 align:middle line:84%
He would go down there, and
he would have rejuvenation

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.360 align:middle line:90%
chambers in these rooms.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And he would put
his body in them.

01:41:39.390 --> 01:41:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
rejuvenate these bodies.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And he would walk around
in a different body,

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and go back and get the other
body that was rejuvenated,

01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:47.337 align:middle line:84%
and transfer his
consciousness back and forth.

01:41:47.337 --> 01:41:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, he would go
through portals under there

01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and travel to other places.

01:41:51.010 --> 01:41:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, these rooms
were discovered.

01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:55.390 align:middle line:84%
If you look
underneath here, they

01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:56.950 align:middle line:90%
discovered these archway rooms.

01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:59.080 align:middle line:10%
They discovered hundreds
of rooms that extend out

01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.453 align:middle line:10%
about a mile underneath Giza.

01:42:02.453 --> 01:42:04.120 align:middle line:10%
They found them about
a year and a half.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.453 align:middle line:10%
They're in my book, "Compendium
of the Emerald Tablets."

01:42:06.453 --> 01:42:07.510 align:middle line:10%
They found the rooms.

01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:09.820 align:middle line:10%
There they're exactly
where Thoth said they were.

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:14.290 align:middle line:90%


01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:17.650 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the alignment
of the pyramid with the shafts,

01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:20.410 align:middle line:84%
the shafts that open up
on the Great Pyramid that

01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:23.920 align:middle line:84%
then line directly up at
certain times of the procession

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:29.080 align:middle line:84%
with the Sirius star system,
Orion's belt, Alpha Draconis,

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.090 align:middle line:90%
and, of course, Ursa Minor.

01:42:31.090 --> 01:42:34.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, these shafts,
in my personal opinion,

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:36.400 align:middle line:84%
were possibly used
for two reasons.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.977 align:middle line:84%
These could be the shafts
that transmit communications

01:42:38.977 --> 01:42:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to these other star
systems, because we know

01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that the pyramid was using
water to generate electricity

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:47.230 align:middle line:84%
from the aquifer that
it was built on top of.

01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:48.520 align:middle line:90%
But also, what's in water?

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.620 align:middle line:10%
Hydrogen. If you
look into science,

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:53.800 align:middle line:10%
you discover that the most
widely used communication

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.460 align:middle line:10%
can be sent or transmitted
through hydrogen frequency.

01:42:57.460 --> 01:43:00.747 align:middle line:84%
So because of that, right now,
even right now, modern science,

01:43:00.747 --> 01:43:02.830 align:middle line:84%
we're transmitting hydrogen
frequencies into space

01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:05.630 align:middle line:84%
to try to communicate with
aliens if we can find them.

01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So why wouldn't we--
why wouldn't they

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.400 align:middle line:84%
have done it back then
since they were much more

01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.510 align:middle line:90%
advanced than us?

01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Send hydrogen frequencies
through those shafts.

01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Another thing could
be that we know that,

01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
according to ancient
texts, that the Great

01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid was a portal generator.

01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that those were
the destination points for them

01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:22.350 align:middle line:90%
to get to?

01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Those were where they would go.

01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they only had
connecting gates

01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:28.420 align:middle line:84%
on the other end
of those places.

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:32.020 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
ancient texts, which

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:35.230 align:middle line:84%
is what I'm going to be doing,
a Chronicles of the Anunnaki

01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:39.460 align:middle line:84%
lecture for six
hours at GaiaSphere.

01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:42.093 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be
on April 25 this year.

01:43:42.093 --> 01:43:43.510 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
an amazing event.

01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:45.677 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start off in
the Pleiadian star system.

01:43:45.677 --> 01:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to come all
the way forward into time.

01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:50.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk about
the galactic wars, planet

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.280 align:middle line:84%
destroyers, people
fleeing from planets

01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and becoming space refugees,
and going to these star systems

01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:58.390 align:middle line:90%
right here.

01:43:58.390 --> 01:44:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is all based
off of ancient text.

01:44:00.880 --> 01:44:04.060 align:middle line:10%
It's based off of cuneiform
writing, the scriptures,

01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:05.830 align:middle line:10%
indigenous histories,
and everything else.

01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It's not based off anything
off the top my head.

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's based off of actual history
that we can get access to

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.710 align:middle line:90%
from hundreds of sources.

01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And I paint a full
picture for you.

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But these are star systems
that they ended up going to.

01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:18.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing that
then the Great Pyramid

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.930 align:middle line:84%
aligns with those same
exact star systems.

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing up here on top of
the pyramid of Quetzalcoatl.

01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Quetzalcoatl was also Thoth
the Atlantean, same person

01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And these are gigantic
Atlantean Toltecs.

01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:36.945 align:middle line:84%
And if you look-- take
a close up of these,

01:44:36.945 --> 01:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
or look them up
on Google, you'll

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.910 align:middle line:84%
see that they're holding
weapons in their hands,

01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:40.510 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:42.385 align:middle line:84%
And they have on what
appears to be some type

01:44:42.385 --> 01:44:43.810 align:middle line:90%
of technological suit.

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.970 align:middle line:84%
But I'm standing on
top of the pyramid.

01:44:45.970 --> 01:44:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the pyramid is
the place where he actually

01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:51.800 align:middle line:84%
had a room that he actually
lived in for a period of time,

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.900 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty amazing.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And behind it, there's
an actual star gate

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:58.110 align:middle line:90%
that he would step into.

01:44:58.110 --> 01:44:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Thoth's quote here.

01:44:59.380 --> 01:45:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're almost wrapping
it up here in a few minutes.

01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:03.588 align:middle line:84%
"Deep in Earth's heart
lie the halls of Amenti,

01:45:03.588 --> 01:45:05.862 align:middle line:84%
far 'neath the island
of the sunken Atlantis.

01:45:05.862 --> 01:45:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Halls of the Dead and
halls of the living

01:45:07.570 --> 01:45:09.640 align:middle line:84%
bathed in the fire
of the infinite ALL.

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Far in a past time,
lost in the space time,

01:45:12.850 --> 01:45:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the children of light
look down on the world.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Seeing the children of
men in their bondage bound

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.440 align:middle line:84%
by the force that
came from beyond,

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.420 align:middle line:84%
knew they that only by freedom
from bondage could man ever

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:24.940 align:middle line:90%
rise from the Earth to the Sun.

01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Down they descended
and created bodies,

01:45:26.710 --> 01:45:28.840 align:middle line:84%
taking the semblance
of men as their own.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:32.020 align:middle line:84%
The Masters of everything
said after their forming,

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:35.200 align:middle line:84%
we are they who formed from
the space dust, partaking

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:38.380 align:middle line:84%
of life from the infinite ALL;
living in the world as children

01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:42.160 align:middle line:84%
of men, like and yet unlike
the children of men."

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:44.985 align:middle line:84%
So they basically-- he's
talking about their ability

01:45:44.985 --> 01:45:47.110 align:middle line:84%
they had to clone bodies,
to make their own bodies.

01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:48.860 align:middle line:84%
They didn't inhabit
other people's bodies.

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:50.770 align:middle line:84%
They used their
own avatar clones.

01:45:50.770 --> 01:45:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would inhabit
them through transfer

01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:53.822 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:45:53.822 --> 01:45:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And they would walk
amongst men, but obviously,

01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:58.900 align:middle line:84%
unlike a man, because they're
really avatar cloned people.

01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:02.290 align:middle line:84%
But they came here, this
particular entity, Thoth,

01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:04.293 align:middle line:90%
to mostly help human beings.

01:46:04.293 --> 01:46:06.460 align:middle line:84%
He had plenty of opportunity
to masquerade as a god,

01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and he never did.

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:11.290 align:middle line:84%
He decided to call himself a
son of Atlantis, and not a god,

01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:13.065 align:middle line:90%
like some of his relatives did.

01:46:13.065 --> 01:46:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And he would teach human
beings all over the planet

01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:18.730 align:middle line:84%
different building techniques,
languages, alchemy, chemistry,

01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:21.900 align:middle line:84%
mathematics, and everything
else, all the sciences.

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you guys
have seen this before.

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:26.920 align:middle line:10%
You can see that China,
Mexico, and Egypt have

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.930 align:middle line:10%
the same alignment
of pyramids that

01:46:28.930 --> 01:46:32.010 align:middle line:10%
align with Orion's Belt,
most likely, in my opinion,

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:34.510 align:middle line:10%
meaning that they're
linking with the star gates

01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:37.250 align:middle line:10%
to transfer back and forth.

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:38.920 align:middle line:90%
This is a Peruvian star gate.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It has a huge mysterious
door-like structure

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:42.730 align:middle line:84%
that was discovered
in Hayu Marca mountain

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:44.770 align:middle line:90%
region in southern Peru.

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the star gates have
this little door-like opening

01:46:48.730 --> 01:46:51.310 align:middle line:84%
on these rocks that have
this little hole in it.

01:46:51.310 --> 01:46:53.287 align:middle line:84%
You see a little hole
right there, right?

01:46:53.287 --> 01:46:54.620 align:middle line:90%
And something goes in that hole.

01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And what archeologists
were saying

01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
was that some kind of
circular disk goes inside that

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:00.870 align:middle line:90%
and fits in it.

01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:02.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a legend that
tells of a time when

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.230 align:middle line:84%
a Spanish conquistador
arrived in Peru.

01:47:05.230 --> 01:47:07.510 align:middle line:84%
He was looting for gold
and precious stones.

01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:11.180 align:middle line:10%
He basically stumbled
across this doorway.

01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.442 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, it
opened into a portal.

01:47:13.442 --> 01:47:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was recorded
through time.

01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:15.977 align:middle line:90%
It became history.

01:47:15.977 --> 01:47:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And he's not the only one.

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.840 align:middle line:84%
This has happened a few
more times documented.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.513 align:middle line:84%
Even people in more
modern times have

01:47:21.513 --> 01:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
opened up some of these
gates and gone through them.

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:25.750 align:middle line:90%
And some people never came back.

01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Never came back.

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.120 align:middle line:90%
You can look it up.

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The Aborigines
believe that the Uluru

01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:33.550 align:middle line:84%
is one of the original
creations from their ancestors.

01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And there may be
petroglyphs found

01:47:35.050 --> 01:47:37.117 align:middle line:84%
on the large rock
devoted to Dreamtime.

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what they call
our world, Dreamtime.

01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:41.650 align:middle line:84%
They call it an
artificial construct.

01:47:41.650 --> 01:47:43.330 align:middle line:84%
By touching the rock,
Aboriginal people

01:47:43.330 --> 01:47:44.705 align:middle line:84%
believe that they
can communicate

01:47:44.705 --> 01:47:47.080 align:middle line:84%
with their ancestors
and the Dreamtime.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And this rock is also known
as an Aboriginal star gate.

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:53.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is another
portal in Australia.

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And Urulu, ironically,
is the same place

01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth talks about
in the Emerald Tablets.

01:47:58.950 --> 01:48:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Uluru.

01:48:00.140 --> 01:48:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Uluru, right.

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's very similar.

01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, wow.

01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Emerald Tablets
36,000 years ago.

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:07.580 align:middle line:90%
This.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:10.840 align:middle line:84%
The Aborigines claim to have
been seeded on this planet.

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.670 align:middle line:10%
The Aboriginal elders
handed down history

01:48:12.670 --> 01:48:14.390 align:middle line:10%
that they were brought
here by the Pleiadians

01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:16.057 align:middle line:10%
and seeded on this
planet, and that they

01:48:16.057 --> 01:48:18.550 align:middle line:10%
were the very first
people on this planet.

01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:20.035 align:middle line:10%
Lord Shiva star gate at CERN.

01:48:20.035 --> 01:48:21.910 align:middle line:10%
So if you know anything
from ancient history,

01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:25.900 align:middle line:10%
Lord Shiva used to
go through portals.

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And Lord Shiva was
an Indian god that

01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:31.590 align:middle line:84%
still was a part of
this Atlantean culture,

01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:36.220 align:middle line:84%
this interplanetary species or
race of people that lived here.

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is the symbol for
the portal for Lord Shiva

01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that this particular
entity would walk through.

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's ironic
that at CERN, where

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:46.075 align:middle line:84%
we talked about creating the
black holes and all that,

01:48:46.075 --> 01:48:47.200 align:middle line:90%
they have it right outside.

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:48.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the front of
CERN, the building

01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:51.370 align:middle line:84%
to go into where they
have the atom smasher.

01:48:51.370 --> 01:48:54.342 align:middle line:84%
They have a gigantic
Lord Shiva at the front.

01:48:54.342 --> 01:48:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Kind of alluding to
the fact that they're

01:48:56.050 --> 01:48:58.803 align:middle line:84%
working on making star gates and
portals is what they're doing.

01:48:58.803 --> 01:48:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Rubbing it in.

01:48:59.750 --> 01:49:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:02.880 align:middle line:10%
This is the Aztec
calendar on the left.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And that's the CERN atom
smasher on the other side,

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.680 align:middle line:10%
on the right.

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:07.480 align:middle line:10%
>> That's crazy.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.397 align:middle line:10%
>> They kind of look
very similar, doesn't it?

01:49:09.397 --> 01:49:11.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I just thought
it was kind of ironic.

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.990 align:middle line:10%
But as you can see
here, no matter

01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:14.407 align:middle line:10%
where you go on
the planet, you're

01:49:14.407 --> 01:49:17.190 align:middle line:10%
going to find the star gate
symbol all over the planet,

01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:19.935 align:middle line:10%
and everywhere.

01:49:19.935 --> 01:49:21.060 align:middle line:10%
They're all over the place.

01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:23.420 align:middle line:10%
This symbol can be found
all over the world.

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:25.920 align:middle line:84%
No matter where you go, you're
going to find these star gate

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.580 align:middle line:90%
symbols.

01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to find
the same, of course, design.

01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you see at
the very bottom,

01:49:32.140 --> 01:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the star gate symbol
on the triptych design

01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:37.055 align:middle line:84%
with the three-window design,
symbolizing the gates,

01:49:37.055 --> 01:49:38.680 align:middle line:84%
transferring from
one place to another,

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.750 align:middle line:90%
or one dimension to the next.

01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:44.293 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, guys,
we ran out of time.

01:49:44.293 --> 01:49:46.335 align:middle line:84%
There were a couple more
images I wanted to show,

01:49:46.335 --> 01:49:47.530 align:middle line:90%
but we're out of time right now.

01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:49.240 align:middle line:84%
I do have some books
here, a few books

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:50.708 align:middle line:90%
left if you want to get them.

01:49:50.708 --> 01:49:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming out.

01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:53.030 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your time.

01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:56.830 align:middle line:90%
