00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Those of you just coming
in, thank you for joining us.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.930 align:middle line:10%
We're just getting started.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.560 align:middle line:10%
So OK, any questions?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.800 align:middle line:90%
So what I want to do--

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:84%
again, I'm acknowledging some
of you were with me Friday,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.200 align:middle line:90%
some were not.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole theme for
what I'm doing here

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.060 align:middle line:90%
is about the human story.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Scott Turow, American
author-- he says this.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I don't
know if he knows that I'm

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:90%
using his words the way I am.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But Scott, if you're
watching, thank

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.817 align:middle line:90%
you, my brother, Scott Turow.

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:36.900 align:middle line:90%
He says it so beautifully.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.690 align:middle line:84%
He says, "who are
we but the stories

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
we tell ourselves about
ourselves and believe?"

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:10%
That is so powerful because
our story is more than just

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:10%
this philosophical concept.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.340 align:middle line:10%
It's something you toss
around the dinner table.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Our story is everything.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Our story is what
determines the way

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.810 align:middle line:10%
that we think about
ourselves, about the way we

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.830 align:middle line:10%
solve our problems, choose our
relationships, heal our bodies.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.510 align:middle line:90%
You go to the ballot box.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you elect to
represent you and create

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.402 align:middle line:84%
the policies and
the laws that govern

00:01:08.402 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
our communities
and our lives, it's

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:84%
all based on the way we've
been taught to think.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.220 align:middle line:90%
It's our story.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
So our story is important.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And you and I have--

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
there's a service
animal in there.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You and I, we are
steeped in a story

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
that's based on false science.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just touch on
that a little bit right now.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
What science says,
our story is defined

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
by what are called four
perennial questions, the four

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.470 align:middle line:90%
great questions of life.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Let me ask you--

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know
this was here.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, this post is here.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.448 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the speaker.

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't-- there's
a whole screen.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:90%
And my laser works.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
My laser doesn't work
on the flat screens.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, cool.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.133 align:middle line:84%
I should come here
more often, right?

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I knew that was there.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I guess I didn't really think
about that one being there.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
If I ask you what are
the perennial questions,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.620 align:middle line:84%
what are the big questions
that humankind is always

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.890 align:middle line:90%
asked about themselves--

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do we-- oh,
you guys are right on.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
These are the
perennial questions.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:90%
See how psychic you are?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:90%
See how this thing works?

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.590 align:middle line:90%
There it is right there.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are we here?

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are we here?

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Where are we going?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, now that we are here,
how do we make things better

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:10%
for where we're going?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm a scientist.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:90%
You all know that.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.692 align:middle line:84%
I've worked-- a
degreed geologist.

00:02:34.692 --> 00:02:36.900 align:middle line:84%
I do have a strong background
in life sciences, which

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
has given me the ability
to talk about what I'm

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about--
molecular biology,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.672 align:middle line:84%
invertebrate and vertebrate
paleontology, and math physics,

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:84%
computer science, all those
things that work together

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:90%
to help me.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:10%
So that screen always says Gaia.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:10%
And that-- OK, now I've got it.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've got it now.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So scientists, when they want
to answer these questions,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
there's two
different approaches.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:10%
Some scientists-- this
one scientific approach

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:10%
says we have to solve
all of these problems.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.665 align:middle line:10%
We have to figure out where did
we come from, why are we here,

00:03:11.665 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:10%
how do we make life better.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And once we do that, then it's
going to tell us who we are.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.213 align:middle line:10%
That's one scientific approach.

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:19.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you follow
that approach,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:10%
that could take how long?

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, a few more
centuries maybe.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:10%
There's another
approach that says

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:10%
if we explore our potential,
if we embrace who we are

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:10%
and bring the extraordinary
potential that we have

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:10%
into our lives, that
is going to lead us

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.580 align:middle line:10%
to the answers of
the big questions.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:10%
Once we fully
embrace what it means

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:10%
to be a human
walking this earth,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:10%
it's going to tell us
where we come from.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:10%
It's going to tell
us why we're here.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.950 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to tell
us exactly what we

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.385 align:middle line:10%
need to do to make life better.

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:10%
Does that make sense?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:10%
Can you see different
ways of thinking?

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
resistance doing this.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%
I-- they're both good.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I prefer this.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
We are such-- you, you and I. We
are such extraordinary beings.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the mainstream media
and main pop science,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
like all pop science has a
way of denigrating humans,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:84%
making us feel like we're
the mistake on the planet,

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.207 align:middle line:84%
like we are the scourge of the
Earth and that humans are--

00:04:21.207 --> 00:04:22.290 align:middle line:90%
you know where it's going.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.770 align:middle line:90%
You see it all the time.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Rarely are we told how
precious our lives are

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and how rare it
is for a life form

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do what you do, to
self-regulate your own biology,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
to heal your own biology,
to reverse the conditions

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that destroy your life into
conditions that give you life

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.565 align:middle line:90%
very consciously on demand.

00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We're the only form of
life that can sit down

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and say, in this moment,
that's what I'm going to do.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Other forms of life
may do it by instinct.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:90%
We do it consciously on demand.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:84%
No other form of
life can do that.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So I prefer to explore who
we are and where we're going.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a scientist, what
I can tell you is this.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
The new science is telling us
in these very obscure, highly

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
technical publications
that very few people get

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to see that you are absolutely
not what you'd been told.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And you are absolutely more
than you probably have even

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:90%
allowed yourself to imagine.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.930 align:middle line:84%
There is a new philosophy
that is emerging.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very cool philosophy
that says our creations,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:10%
the things we create, our
consciousness informing itself

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.055 align:middle line:10%
of itself.

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:90%
Now think about what that means.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.915 align:middle line:84%
We think when we
write books, when we--

00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm a musician when
I'm not doing this.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:90%
We're creating music.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.222 align:middle line:84%
You go to Hollywood
and you see the movies.

00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:44.450 align:middle line:90%
We think those are diversions.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
What if they're not diversions?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
What if they are consciousness,
the way that consciousness

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.220 align:middle line:90%
communicates with itself?

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Because all of those creations
are there because consciousness

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:90%
put them there.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And if this is the
way-- one of the ways

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
is informing us,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
look at what we're drawn to.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Look at the things-- what
are the most popular themes

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
that we see out there?

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And you-- although
the films, the movie--

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
Hollywood for example.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Many different films, but
there are common themes.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.402 align:middle line:84%
Remember when "The Matrix" came
out and then all of a sudden

00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:20.735 align:middle line:84%
after "The Matrix," there's
a movie about the inception.

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
You remember
"Inception" about dreams

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:90%
within dreams within dreams.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And "Avatar" came out telling
us about our relationship

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
to the earth.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And "The Matrix" was
about our relationship

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to a field of energy
that we can't see,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.317 align:middle line:84%
but it influences
our everyday lives.

00:06:35.317 --> 00:06:36.650 align:middle line:90%
What are those films telling us?

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you tell
me what are the films

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that our young people are being
drawn to today, right now?

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Superheroes.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Superheroes that have powers
within them that we identify

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:90%
with in one form or another.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.010 align:middle line:84%
The power between--
to defeat evil,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
for example, or powers to bring
forward superhuman abilities,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
which many of them
which you already have.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability for
super memory, super cognition.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability
for remote viewing.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability to
self-heal, to self-regulate

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
your biology and to apply
that in your everyday life.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this
consciousness, this

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
is the way consciousness is
reminding us of these things.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.917 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
these, new discoveries

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:90%
are telling us who we are.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're revealing
a new story.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
This is a new human story.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So first discovery-- I talked
about this the other day,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:90%
but I have to say this.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:10%
I have to do this for people
that weren't with me so that it

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:10%
makes sense.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:84%
You and I are steeped in this
story that began about 150

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:90%
year-- over 150 years ago.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.640 align:middle line:84%
1859, Charles Darwin
proposed a theory.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
He called it the theory of
evolution by natural selection.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And he wasn't alone.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
He had-- Alfred Wallace
worked with him.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
And other people were working.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
His name got attached
to the proposal.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting
because Darwin

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
himself said he never expected
this theory to last very long.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
He said this is a stepping stone
to get us away from religion

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
as a way to help us to
understand who we are.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And when the new
discoveries come along,

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:90%
my theory will fall.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:90%
It will fail.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.360 align:middle line:90%
It has to.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:90%
And he said--

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I researched.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
I actually have one
of his manuscripts.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
His daughter-- no, his
great-great granddaughter--

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
his great-great
granddaughter was

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:90%
in one of my programs in London.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.732 align:middle line:84%
You never know who's
going to show up

00:08:32.732 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:90%
in your London programs.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:84%
She came up, and it's good
she came up after the program

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.460 align:middle line:90%
and not before.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.929 align:middle line:90%
She came up after the program.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And she really thanked
me for being honest

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:90%
about what her great--

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
I guess great-great grandfather
had done because he was fine

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:90%
if his theory fell.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the modern
academia that will not

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.290 align:middle line:84%
allow his theory to fall
because they're very invested

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.367 align:middle line:90%
in the implications.

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
If you-- what
Darwin said is we're

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:90%
the product of random processes.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Things just magically
happened sort of.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:84%
They called it lucky
biology, a fluke

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.230 align:middle line:90%
of biology, random mutations.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
it gets dangerous.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
He said it was because
competition and conflict were

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
so successful that we have
prevailed over other species.

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And that thinking suggests
if it worked in the past,

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:90%
we should keep doing it.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.950 align:middle line:90%
So I have young people in my--

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:28.310 align:middle line:90%
we do millennial programs.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.727 align:middle line:84%
And we have young
people that say,

00:09:29.727 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
you know Gregg, that's
sweet, really sweet.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.608 align:middle line:84%
And they say, but that
was 150 years ago.

00:09:34.608 --> 00:09:35.408 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:36.560 align:middle line:90%
We're in the 21st century.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.518 align:middle line:90%
We've got the internet.

00:09:37.518 --> 00:09:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Where high tech.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:90%
So what?

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Who cares about this?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's a really good question.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And the answer surprises them.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
The foundation of the society
that you and I live in right

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.360 align:middle line:84%
now was laid down
when this theory was

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:90%
being embraced wholeheartedly.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:59.680 align:middle line:84%
The idea of competition in
the economy, competition,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.260 align:middle line:84%
competitive economics
began right here.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The idea of competition as in
warfare, as a science, the idea

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:90%
of competition in--

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
as the foundation of our society
and conflict and scarcity--

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.925 align:middle line:84%
the corporate model was
based upon these ideas

00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
where I've got something
and there's not much of it

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and you want it, and
I'm going to make

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:90%
you pay big time for it.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:90%
That all comes from this.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
So this idea, although
it's an old idea,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
it's still influencing
our lives today.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So evolution-- I want
to be very, very clear.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm a geologist.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I see in the fossil
record evolution is

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:90%
a fact for many forms of life.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
It breaks down when
it comes to humans.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it breaks down
is what I want to show you today

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:90%
because it's a mind blower.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
with me on Friday,

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you things
you didn't see on Friday.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to say is
evolution is not our story.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin
to let that idea go,

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
the way we solve
our problems begins

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.027 align:middle line:90%
to look very differently.

00:10:57.027 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Bruce Lipton and I were
invited to speak at the UN

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years ago.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And they asked us about what
we're talking about now.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:84%
They asked me about
cycles of time.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And I shared with them that the
fundamental nature of nature,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental law is actually
based on cooperation, not

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:90%
competition.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, how
come we've never heard this?

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.903 align:middle line:90%
It's rock-solid science.

00:11:18.903 --> 00:11:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's in the
peer-reviewed science.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The best science
of the modern world

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
now tells us that nature,
the nature all around us,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental rule is
cooperation, not competition.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to work
in harmony with nature,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it behooves us
to follow those models.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
So evolution-- this
isn't our story.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we know this
is because of new DNA science.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- this
stuff is mind-blowing.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And they're-- like every week--
there's a little journal called

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:10%
"Science."

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It comes out every week
to update the world

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific
discoveries that

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
are so numerous they can't wait
until the end of the month.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
So every week, they're
updating on what's going on.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:10%
The science of the DNA--

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.448 align:middle line:10%
we are now able to extract--

00:12:06.448 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:10%
now just think about
what I'm saying.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We're able to
extract the DNA out

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of the fossils of
ancient forms of life.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are supposed
to be our ancestors.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.130 align:middle line:90%
So it looks like a rock.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But it is petrified DNA
essentially is what it is.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to extract
that DNA from the bone marrow,

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.200 align:middle line:10%
And when you do that, now you
can compare that ancient DNA

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:10%
to what we have today.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.690 align:middle line:10%
And now you can--
don't have to guess.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:34.023 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to have a theory.

00:12:34.023 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:10%
You can say we descended from
these forms of life or we

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:36.850 align:middle line:10%
didn't.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:10%
And guess what.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:10%
We didn't descend
from Neanderthal.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
We didn't descend
from Australopithecus.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:90%
We didn't descend from Lucy.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:84%
That's not-- we shared
the Earth with them.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And we may have
common ancestors.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm not arguing with that.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.345 align:middle line:90%
But something happened.

00:12:51.345 --> 00:12:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
it's telling us.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:90%
There's some of the--

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%
I wanted you to see it.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, people sometimes
ask me what's it look like.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the fossilized
DNA in the bone marrow.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually
see what it looks like.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:10%
What the DNA is telling us--

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.260 align:middle line:10%
I just shared what it's
telling us that we're not.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.200 align:middle line:84%
We're not the
descendants those beings.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Here's what we are.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:84%
What we are is it
says that we humans--

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
we are called anatomically
modern humans.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:10%
We showed up on
Earth mysteriously.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And we don't know
where we came from.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.735 align:middle line:10%
And it happened
200,000 years ago.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Scientists agree with that.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.020 align:middle line:10%
If you Google when
do modern humans

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:10%
appear, no problem,
200,000 years.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
how did it happen.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.890 align:middle line:90%
How did it happen?

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.740 align:middle line:10%
When they take that DNA and
they compare it to ours today,

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.930 align:middle line:10%
they've actually been
able to rebuild--

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:41.080 align:middle line:10%
this is an anatomically modern
human skull, an ancient one.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:10%
This is a modern one.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.625 align:middle line:10%
And when they do the
forensics and they rebuild,

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:48.250 align:middle line:10%
this is what our
ancestors looked like.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.583 align:middle line:10%
They-- I mean, for all intents--

00:13:49.583 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:10%
I probably saw some of these
guys at the kiosk out here.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.503 align:middle line:10%
I mean, really, they don't
look that different, do they?

00:13:55.503 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:10%
And they don't
look much different

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.440 align:middle line:10%
than humans look today, I
mean, pretty much, right?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.847 align:middle line:10%
OK, the only reason
I put Brad Pitt there

00:14:03.847 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:10%
is because we both come
from the same state.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.847 align:middle line:10%
We're both born in Missouri.

00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:10%
So I'll be very
fair and I'll say--

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.596 align:middle line:10%
So we don't look that
much different, right?

00:14:12.596 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:10%
>> He won an Oscar, though.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, he won an Oscar?

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Yay Brad, my brother,
you won the Oscar.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:90%
For what?

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.356 align:middle line:90%
For what movie?

00:14:22.356 --> 00:14:24.015 align:middle line:90%
>> "Once Upon a Time."

00:14:24.015 --> 00:14:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Once upon-- yeah.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm still-- it's a
three-hour movie.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm still watching it.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.178 align:middle line:90%
I started it on a plane trip.

00:14:29.178 --> 00:14:30.803 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't get to
the end of the trip

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:90%
before the movie was over.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.473 align:middle line:90%
So we haven't changed.

00:14:33.473 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is the point.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
This is not Darwin's
idea of evolution.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of principles I
want to talk to you about.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
One of them says,
and Alfred Wallace

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:84%
is the one that stated
this, said that nature never

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:90%
over-endows.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Nature never gives
us more than we need.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.980 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
a life form will only

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:84%
develop certain capacities
and certain characteristics

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:90%
when they need them to survive.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we showed up
on earth 200,000 years ago.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Everything we have right
now was already in place.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
We had more than we needed light
years ahead of when we need it.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And that violates
Darwin's idea of--

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Darwin's idea of evolution.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Either-- sometimes he
talks about evolution

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
as slow, gradual changes
over long periods of time,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.108 align:middle line:84%
or some of you know about
punctuated evolution.

00:15:25.108 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get into
that, but neither one of those

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.960 align:middle line:90%
fit what has happened.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.917 align:middle line:90%
So you are an--

00:15:29.917 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:84%
aren't you glad to know
you're over-endowed?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I like to tell people that.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm an over-endowed speaker.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.260 align:middle line:90%
So scientists know this.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:90%
They know this.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Modern humans appeared
suddenly 200,000 years ago.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And they had all the
capacity, all the capabilities

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that we have right now.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Here's the kicker.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.700 align:middle line:90%
We haven't changed.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.270 align:middle line:84%
We have not changed
in 200,000 years.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.700 align:middle line:10%
And the DNA is telling us that.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:10%
That is a mind blower because
it discounts all of the things

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:10%
that we've been taught,
although the other ideas

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:02.968 align:middle line:10%
are being taught as fact.

00:16:02.968 --> 00:16:04.510 align:middle line:84%
If you've got kids
in school, they're

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
still being taught they're the
product of a random mutation,

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.382 align:middle line:90%
an accident in biology.

00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you
why that's important.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Because it denigrates life.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it very easy
to take another human life

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.310 align:middle line:84%
if you believe it's the
product of an accident.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
with young people

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:23.770 align:middle line:84%
because there appears to
be no sense and no purpose.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, the problem has always been
if it's not random mutations,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
then it must be religion.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:90%
And religion comes in.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not saying that at all.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't think religion has
to come into this at all.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.867 align:middle line:84%
But we know that we are not the
product of a random process.

00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:90%
How do we know that?

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.260 align:middle line:90%
This is where the science--

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
again, science-- we ask
science to tell us who we are.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's telling us.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And all the scientists
don't like the answers.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.500 align:middle line:90%
So how did this happen?

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:90%
This is the kicker.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
Discovery number two, we can
now take the DNA that we have

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and work backward
to find out what

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
had to happen to give
us our capabilities.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.865 align:middle line:84%
So if you were with me Friday,
I showed you one example.

00:16:59.865 --> 00:17:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show it again.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.032 align:middle line:10%
But I'm going to show you
one that we didn't see,

00:17:03.032 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:10%
human chromosome number 7.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:10%
So as a musician, I
mentioned-- how many

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.080 align:middle line:10%
musicians are in the room?

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:10%
You're a musician.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Laurie's a backup singer.

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:90%
How many musicians?

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, have you ever wondered
if we share 98% of our DNA

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:90%
with chimpanzees--

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's almost
the whole genome--

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:90%
how come chimpanzees can't sing?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And you've never heard a
chimpanzee sing Led Zeppelin's

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:90%
"Stairway to Heaven."

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.430 align:middle line:90%
you won't hear it.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.847 align:middle line:90%
And you never will.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And that was-- here.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:90%
That was my whole--

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.988 align:middle line:84%
if we did, it would
look like this.

00:17:31.988 --> 00:17:34.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm waiting for this.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:90%
No, but I mean, it's--

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:90%
we laugh about it.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.940 align:middle line:10%
But seriously, why do you think
that that cannot happen if we

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:10%
are so similar in DNA?

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The answer to the question
is part of the mind blower

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:90%
right here.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Human chromosome number 7.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.090 align:middle line:10%
We all have one of these.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.250 align:middle line:10%
It's responsible
for complex speech.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:10%
It's what gives us the ability--
if my chromosome 7 wasn't

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.410 align:middle line:10%
arranged like it is, I couldn't
be having this conversation

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:10%
with you right now.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:90%
I could be sharing with you.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Speech, complex
language, and music--

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
now I wanted you
to look at this.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you're taking notes,
it's a very specific gene.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to get technical,
but it's called the FOX P2.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:10%
It is one gene on
the FOX P2 gene

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:10%
that is on chromosome number 7.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:10%
It's one of about--

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:10%
I know something like
over 1,300 different genes

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:10%
on that chromosome.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:90%
So look at what happened.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And this is from the
very prestigious journal,

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.830 align:middle line:10%
peer-reviewed journal.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:10%
It is called "Nature."

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And some of you know
what "Nature" is.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a publicly available
peer-reviewed journal, 2002.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:10%
The answer to why the chimpanzee
can't sing "Stairway to Heaven"

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:42.540 align:middle line:10%
is right here.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.640 align:middle line:10%
This is-- it looks a little
complex, but it's not.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:10%
These are primates.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And we are primates.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:10%
The primates are going back
over 75 million years, primates.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:10%
So here are the
rhesus, orangutan.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Here is gorillas.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.790 align:middle line:90%
Here's humans.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
75 million years, this FOX
P2 gene was very stable.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.200 align:middle line:90%
No changes.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.990 align:middle line:90%
75 million years.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:13.710 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, right there,
right there, humans came along.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.041 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
there was this little mm,

00:19:16.041 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:90%
this little 2D--

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:90%
you all know about DNA letters--

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.600 align:middle line:90%
CT, AG, GACT.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
There were two letters
that were switched

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
in just the right way in the FOX
P2 gene in chromosome number 7.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened, it
linked our tongue and our jaw,

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
the muscles in our
throat, and our brain

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
together so the
signals from our brain

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.198 align:middle line:90%
could allow us to communicate.

00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Look at when it happened.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, you could say
maybe this is a fluke.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:10%
And I would say, yeah, you
know, maybe it's unusual.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:10%
But could it happen?

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:10%
Maybe.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:10%
It happened exactly
200,000 years ago.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:10%
BP is before present.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:10%
Happened exactly 200,000
years ago when we appeared.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And you think, well, what are
the chances of that happening?

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Discovery number three--
and some of you saw this--

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to elaborate
on this a little bit--

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:90%
human chromosome number 2.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:10%
If it was only one mutation
that happened 200,000 years ago,

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:10%
I'd say maybe it's a fluke.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:10%
It's not.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:10%
There are a series of mutations.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.560 align:middle line:10%
And they are so bizarre.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:10%
And the scientists are telling
us they cannot happen through

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:10%
natural processes.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Natural processes cannot do
what you're about to see here.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Human chromosome number 2.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.865 align:middle line:84%
It is responsible for most of
what you call the neocortex.

00:20:35.865 --> 00:20:36.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you what that is.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
About 76%-- if you're taking
notes, it's gene TBR1.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:84%
There are I think 1,280
genes in chromosome number 2.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:90%
And one of those-- only one--

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm only talking about
one of the genes.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:84%
There are another 1,200
and, I don't know,

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:84%
89 or whatever it
is, is responsible

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.360 align:middle line:90%
for our enlarged brain.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
we have this capacity

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.273 align:middle line:84%
for emotion and
sympathy and empathy

00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:90%
that give us our uniqueness.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:05.390 align:middle line:90%
This is our humanness.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes us different
from all other forms of life

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to
self-regulate our biology.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't go into
this the other day.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.577 align:middle line:84%
And I'm doing it now, a
little bit more detail.

00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
This-- everything you
see in the green right

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
there, that is
what is responsible

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
or what chromosome 2
is responsible for.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.447 align:middle line:90%
Here is the little lizard brain.

00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
You hear a lot about
the lizard brain.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.240 align:middle line:10%
That's responsible for
basic functions, sex,

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:10%
reproductive drive,
territoriality, hunger, thirst,

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:10%
things like that.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Here's the mammal brain.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:10%
All the good stuff like attack,
anger, anxiety, fear, hate,

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.422 align:middle line:10%
jealousy, all those kinds
of things right here

00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:10%
and then everything--
look at this.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:10%
This is the-- there's
six layers, the neocortex

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:10%
right here.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:50.600 align:middle line:10%
And that's going to be
important because I'm

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:10%
someone to show you
some neocortex stuff,

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.005 align:middle line:10%
some neocortexian stuff.

00:21:55.005 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:10%
I've never used
that word before.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a pretty cool word.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Neocortexian.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.430 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So and it's coming
from right there.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of these
discoveries are so new--

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.935 align:middle line:90%
this one was only in--

00:22:06.935 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:90%
it's less than two years old.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.225 align:middle line:90%
It was only made in '18.

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to
be able to do this.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
On the audio, would you
please bring down the audio

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
on-- for the computer, please?

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
You can actually bring
it down for the computer

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:90%
and the laptop.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Discovery, 2018.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So I know many of
you have seen scans--

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:90%
CTs, MRIs, brain scans.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.700 align:middle line:84%
They're very dull,
flat, two-dimensional.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:90%
They usually look like this.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
There is the technology has
now been driven to develop--

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:90%
I'll just explain what happened.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The brain of a mouse is so
similar in structure, not

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
the way it works, but
structure to a human brain

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that the pharmaceutical
companies will often

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.928 align:middle line:84%
test the pharmaceuticals
on the mouse.

00:23:01.928 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And if it works on
the mouse, they'll

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.638 align:middle line:90%
say, hey, try it on Joe.

00:23:04.638 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It's good enough for the mouse.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be good
enough for Joe.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out
of 10, that works.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.020 align:middle line:84%
They have a class
of pharmaceuticals

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:90%
they tested on the mice.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.140 align:middle line:90%
Everything was cool.

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.380 align:middle line:10%
They tested on the humans
and it didn't work.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And they said, why?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
What could be different about
the human brain from the mouse

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.790 align:middle line:84%
brain that is preventing
these-- this class of drugs

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:90%
from working?

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, this scan didn't
tell them the answer.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So Japanese scientists
developed a new scan.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:90%
And it is now--

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you this.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.630 align:middle line:90%
This is very cool.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
This-- and I want to be very
clear about what you're seeing.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:10%
We typically scan the tissue.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.480 align:middle line:10%
This is not the tissue.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.570 align:middle line:10%
This is the path of
information that the tissue--

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:10%
that flows through the tissue.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.267 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to set
this into motion.

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to
see what's happening

00:23:54.850 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:10%
is the information is coming up
through the spinal cord largely

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.550 align:middle line:10%
from the heart.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And as the information flows,
that's-- it's not the tissue.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the path that the
information flows through.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.360 align:middle line:84%
It is actually-- you've
heard of the genome.

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.890 align:middle line:90%
This is called the connectome.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:90%
The connectome.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to go ahead
and set this into motion.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:10%
And watch what happens.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.790 align:middle line:10%
As the information comes
up from the spinal cord,

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.423 align:middle line:10%
it will be color coded.

00:24:23.423 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:10%
There you can see it's starting
at the bottom right there.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.580 align:middle line:10%
Color-- it's happening
on the inside.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:10%
And then it comes
to the outside.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:10%
It'll be color coded
as it begins to move

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:10%
through the human brain.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that awesome?

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:10%
It's a very different way
of thinking of the brain.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.290 align:middle line:10%
Now once again, it's not tissue.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at the path
that the information is moving

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:10%
through within the tissue.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:90%
And this showed the--

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.470 align:middle line:84%
reason I'm sharing
this with you--

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
this showed the
scientist what it

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
was about us that made
the pharmaceuticals not

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:84%
work for us, but did
work for the mice.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And this-- so first of
all, isn't that cool?

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Any questions?

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
It make sense what
you're looking at here?

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let me
show you what happened.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
That was August '18, the
prestigious journal "Nature."

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.850 align:middle line:10%
And the volume was
called Neuroscience.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.440 align:middle line:10%
I know you all have a
hardbound copy on your bed

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:10%
stand for light bedtime
reading just like I do.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm so exciting to be
in bed with at night.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
I read my neuroscience
journal and have sweet dreams.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.810 align:middle line:90%
Pardon me?

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.002 align:middle line:90%
You can-- yeah, it's all online.

00:25:31.002 --> 00:25:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So if anybody-- did
you get your picture?

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.632 align:middle line:90%
Get your photograph?

00:25:34.632 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:90%
This is photo friendly.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:90%
So here's what they found.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:10%
Now this is a mind
blower because we

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.970 align:middle line:10%
tend to think that we understand
the human body pretty well.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:10%
To find discoveries
of this magnitude

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.815 align:middle line:10%
so late in the game surprises
scientists, medical doctors.

00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:10%
This still hasn't even been
taught in the medical schools

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:10%
yet.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:10%
They found a new
class of neurons.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:10%
I say new.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:56.923 align:middle line:10%
They've always been there.

00:25:56.923 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:10%
We just didn't recognize them.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:10%
It's a new class of neurons.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:10%
If you've ever seen a neuron,
they're pretty simple.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:10%
Look at this one.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:10%
It is a very complex neuron.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.850 align:middle line:10%
This is actually a scan
of what the neuron looks

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.320 align:middle line:10%
like right here.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:90%
So this is the actual--

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:90%
this is the neuron.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.640 align:middle line:84%
The new neuron on
top, it's connected

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
to a typical neuron that's
called a pyramidal neuron right

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:90%
here on the bottom.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:90%
That's a typical neuron.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So you can see the difference.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And it is actually
called the rose--

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.920 align:middle line:90%
there it is right there.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Look how complex it is.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It is the Rosehip neuron
because it looks like this.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.120 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a rosehip berry.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- it's a
plant called a rosehip.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So what's the big
deal about this?

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Just ask me.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Somebody ask me, what's the
big deal about the neuron?

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.107 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the big
deal about the neuron?

00:26:40.107 --> 00:26:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so happy that you
asked me that question

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.450 align:middle line:90%
because I've got an answer.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.010 align:middle line:90%
So here's what this neuron does.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's called
an inhibitory neuron

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that regulates information
in the neocortex.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is in the neocortex.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It regulates the
flow of information

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.700 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate our
state of consciousness.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
This neuron is what
allows us to reach

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.760 align:middle line:84%
higher states of consciousness
when we understand

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.170 align:middle line:90%
how to access this neuron.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.070 align:middle line:90%
And look at this.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It's only in the
human brain, only

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:16.510 align:middle line:84%
in the neocortex because of what
happened in human chromosome 2.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.010 align:middle line:90%
This is just one example.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see how
important chromosome 2 is--

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.690 align:middle line:84%
empathy, sympathy,
compassion, self-regulation.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It's got these Rosehip
neurons that help

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:90%
us to regulate consciousness.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Chromosome 2 is a big deal.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Where in the world
did it come from?

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's the question.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.180 align:middle line:84%
Where did this come-- and
how come other forms of life

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:90%
don't have it?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:90%
Will they have it?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Is this the product
of random mutations?

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.250 align:middle line:90%
Is this the product of an--

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.005 align:middle line:90%
this just happened?

00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely not.

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to show you the paper.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.513 align:middle line:10%
It's a very complex paper.

00:27:54.513 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:10%
It is called-- it's from
the proceedings of National

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:10%
Academy of Sciences.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.840 align:middle line:10%
These are the--
their annual meetings

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.155 align:middle line:10%
or semiannual meetings.

00:28:03.155 --> 00:28:04.030 align:middle line:10%
They meet frequently.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have journals
about the discoveries.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is from the
proceeding of National Academy

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:90%
of Sciences.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.420 align:middle line:90%
The volume was called Genetics.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very complex.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to show you--

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned this the
other day, but I just

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:10%
have to say it again.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:10%
Scientists and engineers,
really interesting people.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.300 align:middle line:10%
I've worked with them all my--

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm one of them.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.090 align:middle line:90%
I am so interesting.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.940 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.990 align:middle line:84%
No, they're-- typically
they do not have a platform.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm the exception
because I've created

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:90%
the platform for myself.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:90%
Many of them do not.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:38.620 align:middle line:84%
They have amazing discoveries
and nobody to tell it to.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why you're not
getting the straight scoop

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.040 align:middle line:90%
on climate change.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.442 align:middle line:84%
The real climate scientists
are not public speakers.

00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And nobody's carrying
their message

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.520 align:middle line:84%
because it's been hijacked
by corporations, by politics,

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.360 align:middle line:84%
by religions, by
special interests.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.420 align:middle line:84%
If you go visit National Center
for Atmospheric Research, NCAR,

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.400 align:middle line:84%
up in Boulder, Colorado,
they're in the lobby.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell you what's
going on with climate change.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.660 align:middle line:84%
But they said, who
do we tell it to?

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.950 align:middle line:90%
They write the papers.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And they end up in
some obscure journal.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:14.503 align:middle line:84%
So this particular paper, when
a scientist writes a paper

00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and they make a
discovery and they

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.590 align:middle line:84%
want to claim all that credit,
you and I both know they say,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.520 align:middle line:90%
look what I found.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And they'll put their
name and maybe they

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:90%
won't have a lot of assistance.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Look what I found.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.175 align:middle line:84%
And when they find something and
they know it's-- they're going

00:29:27.175 --> 00:29:29.782 align:middle line:84%
to take a hit for, when it's
going to be controversial,

00:29:29.782 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:90%
they will usually put--

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.710 align:middle line:84%
they'll study it with a lot
of other people, say, Laurie,

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:middle line:84%
would you put your
name on this paper?

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:84%
This is Laurie, my office
manager of 23 years.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And I think some of you know--

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:90%
I introduced you today--

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
we rarely get to
see one another,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.203 align:middle line:84%
which she says is why we're
still working together

00:29:44.203 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:90%
after 23 years.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.178 align:middle line:84%
And she lives in the
state of Florida.

00:29:47.178 --> 00:29:48.845 align:middle line:84%
So we are converging
here in California.

00:29:48.845 --> 00:29:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's-- thank you, Laurie.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Actually you're not my
office manager anymore.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.050 align:middle line:84%
She is no longer
my office manager.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
She's the executive director
of Wisdom Traditions Global,

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:90%
cosmic.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So when a scientist
makes a discovery

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.040 align:middle line:84%
that they think they
might take a hit for,

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.860 align:middle line:84%
they like to surround themselves
and buffer themselves.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:10%
And they will say,
look what we found.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:10%
With that in mind, national--

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:10%
Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, where

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.270 align:middle line:10%
did human chromosome come--

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:10%
2 come from?

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:84%
"We conclude that human
chromosome 2 is the relic

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.760 align:middle line:90%
of an ancient DNA fusion"--

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.060 align:middle line:84%
that is a big deal in
the world of science--

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.607 align:middle line:90%
"of two ancestral chromosomes."

00:30:37.607 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:90%
And it goes on from there.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take this
beyond where we went when

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.740 align:middle line:90%
I was with you at the keynote.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But what this is saying is that
there are two chromosomes that

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:90%
were preexisting.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were fused
in a very precise way.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So let me just give
you an example.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a world example.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
If you had two companies,
two corporations that

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:06.860 align:middle line:84%
were fully intact, very
successful on their own,

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:10.468 align:middle line:84%
and each one of them had their
own human resources department

00:31:10.468 --> 00:31:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and each had their own
shipping department,

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.870 align:middle line:84%
each has their own
billing department.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
these two companies

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:19.670 align:middle line:84%
in a very unlikely
way merge together

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
in a way that
could never happen.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.568 align:middle line:84%
For example, what if
Amazon and Whole Foods?

00:31:23.568 --> 00:31:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That would never happen
in a million years.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
It's so weird.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.505 align:middle line:90%
But if it ever did happen--

00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.443 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe it
when that happened.

00:31:33.443 --> 00:31:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Everything's going be
Amazon before it's over.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.120 align:middle line:90%
You know that, right?

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, when Amazon and
Whole Foods merged,

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:42.620 align:middle line:90%
this is exactly what happened.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.300 align:middle line:84%
They each had their
own human resources.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.467 align:middle line:90%
They had their own shipping.

00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:48.140 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
data management.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.480 align:middle line:84%
When they merged
together, you tell me what

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:90%
happens to those departments.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Some of them.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of them may
have common interest.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.403 align:middle line:90%
Some may actually do thing--

00:31:57.403 --> 00:31:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Amazon might do things
differently than Whole Foods.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.092 align:middle line:84%
Now if you've got a billing
department from Amazon

00:32:02.092 --> 00:32:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that conflicts with the billing
department from Whole Foods

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and you merge those together,
something's got to give, right?

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.730 align:middle line:84%
People are going
to lose their jobs.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.160 align:middle line:90%
They're going to merge.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:90%
Functions are going to be added.

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Functions are going
to be taken away.

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same with all
those departments, right?

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:90%
Are you with me on that?

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.780 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly what happened here.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.460 align:middle line:84%
When these two
chromosomes were merged,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.710 align:middle line:84%
they were fully intact,
fully functional.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:24.770 align:middle line:84%
When they merged, they
had functions that

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.870 align:middle line:90%
actually denigrated the other--

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:90%
the merging of the two.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.787 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not enough
that they get fused.

00:32:31.787 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's a big deal.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:90%
But look at this.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.460 align:middle line:84%
After they fused, there were
modifications that happened.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Genes were added.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:10%
Genes were taken away.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:10%
Genes were modified to stabilize
and optimize that fusion.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.500 align:middle line:10%
And it did not happen
slowly, gradually,

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:10%
over a long period of time.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It happened-- you just take a
wild, psychic, Conscious Life

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Expo LA intuitive guess.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:90%
When would you imagine?

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> 200,000 years.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly 200,000
years ago, chromosome 7,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:57.750 align:middle line:90%
200,000 years ago.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Humans emerged
200,000 years ago.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.560 align:middle line:84%
This is not an
evolutionary process.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know-- as a
scientist, I can speculate.

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you where
we're going with this.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:12.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the whole point.

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:15.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what happened
because our young people--

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.330 align:middle line:84%
right now in
school, young people

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:84%
are ready to dedicate their
whole lives to solving

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:90%
the mysteries of our origins.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And they're being forced to
take all of their discoveries

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:28.730 align:middle line:84%
and fit them into a preexisting
model called evolution

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than allowing
the discoveries to lead

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.753 align:middle line:90%
to whatever story they tell.

00:33:33.753 --> 00:33:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that difference?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.085 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge difference between--

00:33:37.085 --> 00:33:38.960 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting a
square peg in round hole.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.300 align:middle line:84%
If you pound hard enough,
it eventually will fit.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.918 align:middle line:90%
And it's never a good fit.

00:33:43.918 --> 00:33:45.210 align:middle line:90%
And this is what they're doing.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:84%
So the point is we don't
know where we came from.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.367 align:middle line:84%
Now you and I may
sense intuitively.

00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you our
indigenous ancestors, what

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.600 align:middle line:90%
they tell us.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.397 align:middle line:84%
But the science has
yet to arrive there.

00:33:56.397 --> 00:33:58.230 align:middle line:84%
But these-- this is
what they're looking at.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So does this make
sense right now?

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.410 align:middle line:84%
First of all, and I'm going to
move really quickly after this.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to
lay that foundation.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Quick--

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just super curious if
there was anything like planet

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that was going on
200,000 years ago.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> On the planet--
planetarily, there were--

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.922 align:middle line:84%
there was climate change
that was going on.

00:34:12.922 --> 00:34:15.440 align:middle line:84%
As a geologist-- what I can
tell you as a geologist,

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago
isn't really that long.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:18.929 align:middle line:90%
It's not that long ago.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:20.489 align:middle line:90%
It's relatively recently.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.170 align:middle line:84%
The planet had been
here cooking away

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:27.630 align:middle line:84%
for a long time when
we showed up this time.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
There's evidence
that we've probably

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.520 align:middle line:90%
been here long before this.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole different
Conscious Life Expo workshop.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:40.569 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed that
it said [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So the question is--

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:84%
the question is they
were primate chromosomes.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's like the most advanced
DNA available 200,000 years ago

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.929 align:middle line:84%
was selected and modified
to become something

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.468 align:middle line:90%
more than it was naturally.

00:35:00.468 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I'll just tell you where
this gets really, really

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm involved-- I'm also--

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a degreed archaeologist.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.847 align:middle line:84%
I'm a-- did I mention
I'm a geologist?

00:35:08.847 --> 00:35:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Did I tell you that?

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I just have to say that every
time I get the opportunity.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a geologist
invited to consult

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.980 align:middle line:90%
on archaeological projects.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
archaeological projects

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.460 align:middle line:84%
are dealing with
ancestral evidence

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:30.080 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic relationships,
pictoral evidence, and now

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:33.920 align:middle line:84%
skeletal evidence
with DNA components.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.937 align:middle line:84%
When those skeletal-- that
skeletal evidence is analyzed,

00:35:37.937 --> 00:35:39.770 align:middle line:84%
something very-- a lot
of this is coming out

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.920 align:middle line:84%
of Mesoamerica, so the
American Desert Southwest all

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
the way down, Mexico down
into Latin America, down

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.240 align:middle line:84%
into Northern South
America in the Andes.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.280 align:middle line:90%
When the skeletal remains--

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.312 align:middle line:84%
now we can pull the DNA out
of that skeletal remains.

00:35:56.312 --> 00:35:57.270 align:middle line:90%
They're not fossilized.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.982 align:middle line:90%
They're not that old.

00:35:58.982 --> 00:36:00.440 align:middle line:84%
What they're finding
is this-- it's

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.160 align:middle line:84%
very interesting-- is that the
female component of the DNA

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.840 align:middle line:84%
is human, haplogroup A,
haplogroup B, Mesoamerican,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.700 align:middle line:90%
just what you'd expect.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
The male components
cannot be identified.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.330 align:middle line:84%
There is no equivalent in the
National Institutes of Health

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:21.800 align:middle line:84%
database for any known
past or present male

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:26.460 align:middle line:84%
DNA that matches the DNA that's
coming from those skeletons.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The skeletal structure is
not typical human skeletal

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.860 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The skulls are actually
thinner than ours,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.550 align:middle line:84%
but structurally
stronger because they

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.280 align:middle line:84%
are of a crystalline-- there
is a crystalline matrix that's

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.340 align:middle line:84%
different than human crystalline
matrix in the skulls.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know that.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And they say that these
are one-off mutations.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.200 align:middle line:84%
They say it was some
disease, some dis--

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.180 align:middle line:84%
because they have to because
they have no mechanism

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.980 align:middle line:90%
to describe that.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:84%
So as a scientist,
what I like to do

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:00.200 align:middle line:84%
is share with you what
I can say is fact.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.682 align:middle line:90%
And I'm happy to speculate.

00:37:01.682 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
we know right now.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.750 align:middle line:84%
What we know is the
DNA is not the product

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:07.370 align:middle line:90%
of evolutionary processes.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:09.050 align:middle line:84%
This paper actually
says it, by the way.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.170 align:middle line:84%
It says this is not the product
of something that would happen

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:13.612 align:middle line:90%
from an evolutionary process.

00:37:13.612 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Here it is right there.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Can you see that little
pinch point right there?

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:84%
That is where one fully
intact chromosome is now

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.707 align:middle line:84%
fused kind of in a very
specific way onto the other one.

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I showed-- if you
were with me Friday,

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:90%
I showed you the uniqueness.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to go into that.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.240 align:middle line:84%
If you don't like that,
I made that little movie

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:31.320 align:middle line:84%
right here because I'm
a very visual person.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.020 align:middle line:90%
So here is one chromosome.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.530 align:middle line:90%
There's another.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Genes were added.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Genes were taken away.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.320 align:middle line:84%
They were fused and modified,
stabilized to give us

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.910 align:middle line:90%
human chromosome number 2.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.180 align:middle line:84%
What scientists say is that
the timing, the fact that this

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.690 align:middle line:84%
happened 200,000 years ago,
number one, the precision

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
with which it happened given the
way that these genes were added

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and taken away, and
the result. The result

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.350 align:middle line:84%
is empathy,
sympathy, compassion.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the neurons
and the neocortex

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.270 align:middle line:84%
all suggest something
beyond evolution.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.180 align:middle line:90%
This has now led to what's--

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I love this--
forbidden territory.

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And the forbidden territory--

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.700 align:middle line:84%
this is where the
scientific community's

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.220 align:middle line:84%
hit a wall because the
evidence has brought them

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to this point where
it looks like there

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.260 align:middle line:84%
is an intentionality
underlying what happened.

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And science has
no way to account

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:90%
for that intentionality.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:26.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, this is where our
story begins because if this

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.430 align:middle line:84%
was done intentionally,
who or whatever

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:90%
did that had a purpose.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.580 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose is what we're
going to explore here today.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:38.360 align:middle line:84%
What extraordinary
potentials were given to us

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:41.060 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago that we're
either not using or only

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.860 align:middle line:90%
beginning to understand?

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Now just in case you're
wondering, I like this.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Scientists tell us the odds--

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.860 align:middle line:84%
when the odds of
something occurring

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:84%
are one in 10 to the
400th-- so that's

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:90%
10 with 400 zeros after it.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You've got a lottery
ticket, and the odds

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.730 align:middle line:84%
of that being a good ticket
are 1 in 10 to the 400,

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.490 align:middle line:84%
they say it is considered
to be impossible, all right?

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.460 align:middle line:84%
The odds of the
DNA doing what it

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.673 align:middle line:84%
is that we're looking at right
now are one in 10 to the 600th.

00:39:09.673 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess I want to show you
what that looks like just

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
in case you're curious.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So if one in 10 to the
400th is impossible,

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
it's more than impossible
that this is a fluke of nature

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.340 align:middle line:90%
that just happened to occur.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So if it's not a fluke,
then the question

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:27.510 align:middle line:90%
is who or what is responsible?

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And it depends on who you
ask because everybody's

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.010 align:middle line:90%
got an answer.

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.440 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Sumerians--
they've got a wonderful story

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.600 align:middle line:84%
if you ever read
Zecharia Sitchin's work.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.730 align:middle line:90%
I toured with him in the '90s.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The "Earth Chronicles" series
is all about his translation

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.060 align:middle line:90%
of the cuneiform texts.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Aboriginals were just
down there not long ago.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.060 align:middle line:10%
Look, their creation
story describes

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.710 align:middle line:10%
what happened beautifully.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.250 align:middle line:10%
The Hopi and Navajo are right
in their own backyard here.

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.250 align:middle line:10%
They've got their story.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.450 align:middle line:10%
The Hindus have their story.

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.335 align:middle line:10%
The Egyptians have their story.

00:39:57.335 --> 00:39:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I love the Christian
story because they

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.500 align:middle line:84%
got such great
pictures right there.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.720 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.480 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the artifacts
that are being discovered.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.355 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can
see from here or not,

00:40:09.355 --> 00:40:12.280 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to point
it out what's happening.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Here is a being right here.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm pointing with my pointer.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The being is holding an
infant above his or her head

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.190 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're having some
relationship with whatever

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.190 align:middle line:90%
you think that is right there.

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And we are finding
this isn't a one off.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.793 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there
are almost 4,000

00:40:33.793 --> 00:40:35.460 align:middle line:84%
of these artifacts
that have been found.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.200 align:middle line:84%
That'd be pretty
hard to hoax 4,000.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
being found in situ.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.430 align:middle line:90%
So they're in the earth.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not laying them--

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:90%
pardon me?

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Who did this?

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Who did this?

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah [INAUDIBLE] original?

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we don't know.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.310 align:middle line:10%
We don't know because these are
all predating the cultures that

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.130 align:middle line:10%
were supposed to exist.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
There's the Olmec and
the Toltec and the Maya

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.997 align:middle line:90%
and the Inca and the Aztec.

00:41:03.997 --> 00:41:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And these pre-date all of those.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.474 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:06.474 --> 00:41:07.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:08.246 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:08.246 --> 00:41:09.046 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:41:09.046 --> 00:41:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, absolutely.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.690 align:middle line:84%
The question is if doing this
can actually affect the-- reset

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:18.490 align:middle line:90%
the epigenetic clock and--

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:22.952 align:middle line:84%
>> But in not such a way that
it will affect [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:22.952 --> 00:41:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's all-- and that's
where we're going to go with

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:25.520 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.660 align:middle line:90%
You're going to see this.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.750 align:middle line:84%
If you watch TV, History
Channel, they've got their--

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.670 align:middle line:84%
everybody's got a story
about what happened.

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:33.290 align:middle line:10%
You and I are
steeped in this story

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.600 align:middle line:10%
right here that even the
scientists don't believe.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.750 align:middle line:10%
Look at the gap they put between
our nearest ancestor and us.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.413 align:middle line:10%
They know there's
something missing.

00:41:40.413 --> 00:41:42.330 align:middle line:10%
That's right out of the
Smithsonian Institute.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And now the DNA is
telling us a new story.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:45.560 align:middle line:10%
These are all stories.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.020 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's got a
story of what happened.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:52.550 align:middle line:10%
So my invitation-- I wrote a
book called "Human by Design."

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.390 align:middle line:10%
Was the invitation
for scientists

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:10%
to leave behind the burden
of the shackles that

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.843 align:middle line:10%
have kept them from
following the evidence?

00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And let's follow the evidence
to the story, whatever

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:06.260 align:middle line:90%
that story is that it tells.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And there's a whole story
about where that has led me

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and who's supporting
that and who's not.

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:12.500 align:middle line:84%
But where I want
to do today now--

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I've just laid-- this is
a foundation for where

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:90%
we're going.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Something happened to
us 200,000 years ago.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us everything
we need not just

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.530 align:middle line:84%
survive, but to transcend,
become better people,

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps for the
first time know what

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:26.107 align:middle line:90%
it means to be fully human.

00:42:26.107 --> 00:42:27.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I want us to do.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The common denominator to all
of those traditions, Egyptian

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.870 align:middle line:90%
and Christian and everyone--

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Sumerian-- every
one of them says

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:84%
there has been an
intervention of some kind.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist, I
have to support that.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.830 align:middle line:84%
There has to have been
some kind of intervention

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:48.710 align:middle line:84%
in our genetic history that
has given us what we are today.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think we owe it
to ourselves to do this.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:84%
How do we awaken whatever
that potential is?

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's where I want to go.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:56.240 align:middle line:10%
That's what we're going to
do for the rest of our day.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.520 align:middle line:10%
You good?

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.080 align:middle line:10%
You good with what we just did?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:90%
It was fast.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.370 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted you to have
that because it leads

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:10%
right to discovery number four.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:04.310 align:middle line:10%
This-- I'm sorry, question.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:08.130 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Blood type?

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.938 align:middle line:90%
There is a correlation.

00:43:10.938 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the correlation
you would probably expect.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't perhaps hold the
meaning that we might think.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:22.620 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's more than I can do
justice to in this conversation

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:25.710 align:middle line:84%
right now because I
had the same question.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
would blood type--

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Rare blood types
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.113 align:middle line:90%


00:43:33.113 --> 00:43:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, my question is what was
the blood type of the skeletons

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:90%
that were found?

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And they haven't--
we don't know that.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.000 align:middle line:84%
This discovery is another
one of the discoveries

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:90%
that came relatively late.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.910 align:middle line:10%
I mean, 1991.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.110 align:middle line:10%
We've been doing about 10,000
heart transplants a year

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.280 align:middle line:10%
successfully.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.327 align:middle line:10%
We, I mean society, the world.

00:43:55.327 --> 00:43:56.660 align:middle line:10%
And it started back in the '60s.

00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Remember Christiaan
Barnard and DeBakey and--

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.697 align:middle line:10%
and the reason they're
successful, scientists say,

00:44:01.697 --> 00:44:03.280 align:middle line:10%
is because we know
everything there is

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:10%
to know about the human heart.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.410 align:middle line:10%
So to have this
discovery come along so--

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I mean, '91.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.950 align:middle line:10%
That wasn't that long ago.

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:11.630 align:middle line:10%
To have this come
along so recently--

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.670 align:middle line:10%
1991, scientists--
this was published

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.000 align:middle line:10%
in the journal Neurocardiology,
Oxford University Press.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.530 align:middle line:10%
Discovery was '91.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:19.860 align:middle line:10%
It was published in '94.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:10%
They wait until '94
to even publish it,

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.765 align:middle line:10%
was that the heart has about
40,000 specialized cells that

00:44:26.765 --> 00:44:27.682 align:middle line:10%
are like brain cells.

00:44:27.682 --> 00:44:28.890 align:middle line:10%
But they're not in the brain.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:10%
They're in the human heart.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.840 align:middle line:10%
The heart has its own brain.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.360 align:middle line:10%
It's called the little
brain in the heart.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.650 align:middle line:10%
And those nervous
cells, those neurons,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:41.660 align:middle line:10%
they actually
learn independently

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:10%
of the cranial brain.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:43.730 align:middle line:10%
They remember.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:10%
They feel.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.770 align:middle line:10%
They sense.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.020 align:middle line:10%
And right there-- I mean,
think about what this means.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.980 align:middle line:10%
Every one of us, every one of
us has had trauma in our lives.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.790 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes we
resolve that trauma.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.340 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes we don't.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:59.360 align:middle line:10%
And when you go to a
therapist or a counselor

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and you need some
help and they ask

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:02.990 align:middle line:10%
you to talk about your trauma--

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:10%
maybe it was a betrayal or a
loss, the loss of a parent,

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.750 align:middle line:10%
of a loved one--

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.490 align:middle line:10%
and you leave and you say, OK,
well that helped a little bit.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.520 align:middle line:10%
But there's something
that's not resolved--

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:10%
this may help to understand
why because unless you are

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.870 align:middle line:10%
addressing the
neurons in the heart,

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.320 align:middle line:10%
there's an entire neural
network in the heart that rarely

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.120 align:middle line:10%
is addressed.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.210 align:middle line:10%
They're addressing what's
happening in the brain

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:10%
because that's the training.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.430 align:middle line:10%
So neurons in the heart--
they think, they learn,

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:34.130 align:middle line:10%
they feel, they
remember independently

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.810 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.400 align:middle line:84%
All right, so look at
what's happening here.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:84%
'91, scientists discovered
these specialized cells

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.230 align:middle line:90%
in the human heart.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying,
OK, they're there.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.200 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.980 align:middle line:90%
What do we do with these cells?

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:90%
What is that all about?

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:50.730 align:middle line:84%
Well now we know that we
are the only form of life

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.900 align:middle line:90%
that can do this.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.690 align:middle line:10%
We have two organs-- the
heart and the brain--

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.520 align:middle line:10%
and I'm-- you know,
as an engineer,

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.620 align:middle line:10%
my engineer friends have always
said forget about the heart.

00:45:58.620 --> 00:45:59.460 align:middle line:10%
That's Woo-Woo stuff.

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.502 align:middle line:10%
It's all about the brain.

00:46:00.502 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And my artist, musician friends
say forget about the brain.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320 align:middle line:10%
That's left brain stuff.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.370 align:middle line:10%
I don't even have a checkbook.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:06.330 align:middle line:10%
I can't even drive a car.

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.740 align:middle line:10%
I don't even have
a driver's license.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:10%
Just let me create.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:10%
It's all about the heart.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.050 align:middle line:10%
It's incomplete.

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:10%
Here's the deal.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.430 align:middle line:10%
They work together
as a partnership.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:18.600 align:middle line:10%
The heart-- for you to
become fully enabled, fully

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:21.300 align:middle line:10%
capacitated human is
to embrace the power

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.490 align:middle line:10%
to harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.070 align:middle line:10%
to become more than
either one of those organs

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:10%
can offer individually.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're the only form
of life that can do it.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.623 align:middle line:84%
And you can only do
it because of what

00:46:30.623 --> 00:46:33.750 align:middle line:84%
happened in human chromosome
2 200,000 years ago.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Who or whatever gave
us this capacity

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.660 align:middle line:84%
gave us the godlike
capacity-- and I

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.400 align:middle line:84%
say that because
it is attributed

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to the gods in
the ancient texts.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And other worlds
were able to do what

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.820 align:middle line:84%
you can do with your
heart and your brain

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.797 align:middle line:90%
when you put your heart into it.

00:46:49.797 --> 00:46:51.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's what we're
going to do right now.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.890 align:middle line:10%
Two organs can become
one potent system.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.740 align:middle line:84%
It's called heart-brain
harmony in lay terms,

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.220 align:middle line:84%
or more formally it is
called heart-brain coherence.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:07.102 align:middle line:84%
When you can create a 0.1
Hertz signal between the heart

00:47:07.102 --> 00:47:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, when you
can create the feelings

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
in your heart that
send 0.1 Hertz

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.220 align:middle line:84%
between your heart
and your brain,

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.450 align:middle line:90%
that's where the action is.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.820 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
happening right there.

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.500 align:middle line:90%
Why would you want to do that?

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.098 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of reasons.

00:47:21.098 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of reasons
why you-- and I'm just

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.140 align:middle line:84%
going to give you a couple
of pages of them right now,

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.340 align:middle line:90%
just a handful.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Super longevity.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.730 align:middle line:84%
When you harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:84%
you enable the enzymes
in the cells of your body

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:35.888 align:middle line:84%
that are designed to stop
the damage to the DNA,

00:47:35.888 --> 00:47:37.680 align:middle line:84%
to heal the damage
that's already occurred,

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.280 align:middle line:84%
and to rebuild the
caps, the telomeres.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.310 align:middle line:10%
You awaken those-- no?

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:47.020 align:middle line:90%
No, it's true.

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:47.940 align:middle line:90%
No, absolutely.

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.010 align:middle line:90%
So that is just from--

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.718 align:middle line:84%
without doing any more
beyond harmonizing

00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:84%
the heart and the brain,
one of the reasons

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:84%
is because it relieves
the stress that

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:59.100 align:middle line:84%
prevents that system
from becoming enabled.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Super immune response,
direct access

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.420 align:middle line:84%
to deep heart intelligence,
deep intuition,

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.343 align:middle line:84%
those 1,300 positive biochemical
reactions, super resilient.

00:48:10.343 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
talk about this.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have some
resilience, some experiences

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.160 align:middle line:84%
in here, deep intuition,
super intuition,

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:90%
access the subconscious.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:90%
Anybody in here do affirmations?

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:25.560 align:middle line:84%
If you do an affirmation,
for it to be effective,

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.440 align:middle line:84%
it must communicate
with your subconscious--

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.960 align:middle line:84%
here's the key-- in a language
your subconscious recognizes.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.188 align:middle line:84%
It must be the language your
subconscious recognizes.

00:48:35.188 --> 00:48:36.980 align:middle line:84%
When you harmonize the
heart and the brain,

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:40.250 align:middle line:84%
it's a hotline to the
subconscious without hypnosis.

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.395 align:middle line:10%
Super learning, super
memory, super cognition,

00:48:42.395 --> 00:48:44.103 align:middle line:10%
we're going to talk
about mirror neurons,

00:48:44.103 --> 00:48:46.430 align:middle line:10%
super heart rate
variability, and more

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:49.400 align:middle line:10%
just from harmonizing
the heart and the brain.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:54.650 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted you to see what a
powerful, powerful system this

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:55.860 align:middle line:90%
can be.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you never
use it, that's fine.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But if you choose to use it,
we have access to something

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.900 align:middle line:84%
that literally,
literally empowers us

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.010 align:middle line:84%
in what some people
call a superhuman way.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.385 align:middle line:10%
So heart-brain
harmony-- when you

00:49:09.385 --> 00:49:11.760 align:middle line:10%
harmonize the heart and brain,
that's just the beginning.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:10%
That's not the end.

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.393 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people, they
do this and say, OK, I

00:49:14.393 --> 00:49:15.520 align:middle line:10%
did my heart-brain harmony.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.320 align:middle line:10%
That's cool.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.270 align:middle line:10%
It can do some things.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.450 align:middle line:10%
But it also opens the door
to so, so, so much more.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.252 align:middle line:10%
It's only the beginning.

00:49:22.252 --> 00:49:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Now you all know
everything in the body--

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.220 align:middle line:84%
how am I doing on
time, by the way?

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to start
talking really fast.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Heart-brain coherence.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.047 align:middle line:84%
It synchronizes the
systems of the body.

00:49:38.047 --> 00:49:39.630 align:middle line:84%
You know that
everything is connected.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.300 align:middle line:84%
But you may not
know how connected.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:46.320 align:middle line:10%
You all know Dr. Bruce Lipton,
my dear friend, colleague.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I was presenting
with him recently.

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And I shared this slide.

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And he said-- his
eyes get really big.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I love it when Bruce-- he
goes, I want that slide.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:84%
This is-- it was 2018, they
published the most recent map

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.587 align:middle line:84%
of the metabolic pathways
of the human body.

00:50:07.587 --> 00:50:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to share that map.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't read it,
don't worry because neither

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.910 align:middle line:90%
can anyone else.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It is so complex.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.780 align:middle line:84%
This is how connected
everything in your body is.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it's
important in just a minute.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Here's-- are you ready?

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.168 align:middle line:90%
OK here's the map right here.

00:50:20.168 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that awesome?

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the reason when a
pharmaceutical company tells

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.390 align:middle line:84%
you on the label
of a prescription

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:33.407 align:middle line:84%
that there are side effects,
there are no side effects

00:50:33.407 --> 00:50:34.740 align:middle line:90%
because everything is connected.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:37.410 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible-- for
example, you cannot take

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.153 align:middle line:10%
an antihistamine and expect
its effects to be limited only

00:50:41.153 --> 00:50:43.320 align:middle line:10%
to one part of the system
because everything else is

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.418 align:middle line:10%
connected.

00:50:44.418 --> 00:50:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking
an antihistamine,

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.020 align:middle line:90%
it may make you drowsy.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.562 align:middle line:84%
Don't operate heavy machinery
or drive while you're doing it.

00:50:49.562 --> 00:50:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It may make it hard to
pee for some people.

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:54.780 align:middle line:90%
It may make you nauseous.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.060 align:middle line:84%
All those because everything
is interconnected.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is the
really good news.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:00.210 align:middle line:90%
This is really good news.

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is so interconnected,

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.700 align:middle line:84%
when you harmonize your
heart and your brain,

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:09.080 align:middle line:90%
guess what else gets harmonized.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Every organ, every gland,
all the systems in your body.

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.657 align:middle line:84%
So it is not limited to
the heart and the brain.

00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:17.365 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I wanted
to show you this.

00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:18.170 align:middle line:90%
That make sense?

00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:19.040 align:middle line:90%
You good with that?

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes, no?

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.142 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, audience
participation.

00:51:22.142 --> 00:51:23.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.610 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share with
you how this happens.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
show you something.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:31.510 align:middle line:84%
You all have seen metronomes
used for illustrations.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:35.270 align:middle line:84%
You've been with my brother Dr.
Joe or any people like that.

00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:36.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you another one.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And the only reason is
because I can show you

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.680 align:middle line:10%
something different than
what they're showing.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show a
series of metronomes.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.980 align:middle line:90%
They're right here.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But they are mounted
on this board.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.850 align:middle line:84%
And that board is
setting on a rigid table.

00:51:52.850 --> 00:51:55.400 align:middle line:10%
The table doesn't move.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:52:00.230 align:middle line:10%
What that means is
kinetic energy--

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:04.190 align:middle line:10%
these metro gnomes
are limited in motion

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:09.230 align:middle line:10%
because they are bolted to this
and they are on a fixed table,

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.070 align:middle line:10%
all right?

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So if they are
moving long enough,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:84%
eventually they will
probably come into sync.

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.950 align:middle line:10%
It takes a while
because the system

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.020 align:middle line:10%
is limited by its environment.

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:24.110 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when
we are not operating

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.430 align:middle line:90%
in the heart-brain coherence.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.320 align:middle line:10%
We are limited--
we're at the mercy

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.500 align:middle line:10%
of our external environment
because we've not harmonized

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.160 align:middle line:10%
our inner environment.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.460 align:middle line:84%
However, this gentleman
is going to do

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:36.330 align:middle line:90%
something very interesting.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:40.430 align:middle line:84%
He's going to take this
board with the metronomes

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and lift it from the
rigidity of the table

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and set it on top of rollers.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It happens to be a couple
of empty Coke cans.

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:90%
He was just being resourceful.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And once it's on those
rollers, the system

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.680 align:middle line:84%
is freed from the limitation
of a fixed environment.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It now can move
relative to itself.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And watch how quickly it
comes into synchronization.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.843 align:middle line:84%
And then once it's in sync, he
will take it off the rollers,

00:53:11.843 --> 00:53:13.760 align:middle line:84%
put it back on the table,
and look how quickly

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.280 align:middle line:90%
it loses its synchronization.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.140 align:middle line:10%
That's the
equivalent-- when it's

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:21.200 align:middle line:10%
on those rollers, that's the
equivalent of you harmonizing

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.580 align:middle line:10%
the heart and the brain.

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:10%
When he takes it
off the rollers,

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.790 align:middle line:10%
that's when we're
going through our day

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:27.980 align:middle line:10%
and we may feel a
little out of sync.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.350 align:middle line:10%
And that's exactly
what's happening.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Does it makes sense what I
just described, first of all?

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to turn
up the audio here.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I think I should
have audio on this.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:38.798 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:53:38.798 --> 00:53:41.980 align:middle line:10%
[CLICKING]

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:52.453 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.453 --> 00:53:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, watch how quickly
these come into sync

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:56.290 align:middle line:90%
because they're--

00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:59.742 align:middle line:84%
see how they're moving
relative to the fixed surface.

00:53:59.742 --> 00:54:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Now watch what happens.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:06.943 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:08.860 align:middle line:10%
He's going to let those
run for a few seconds.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.780 align:middle line:10%
And he's going to take
it off of the rollers

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.870 align:middle line:10%
and put it back on the table
and watch how quickly they

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:14.690 align:middle line:10%
lose their sync.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:18.690 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKING]

00:54:18.690 --> 00:54:40.190 align:middle line:90%


00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:43.103 align:middle line:84%
So they are totally
in sync right now.

00:54:43.103 --> 00:54:45.020 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to do a
little time lapse here.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:49.430 align:middle line:10%
And now he's going to take
it off of the rollers.

00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:50.240 align:middle line:10%
Watch what happens.

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.573 align:middle line:10%
And look how quickly it happens.

00:54:51.573 --> 00:55:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.740 align:middle line:90%
So you see what's happening.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.700 align:middle line:84%
When we are not in that
heart-brain harmony,

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.950 align:middle line:84%
we are subject to the external
environment and all the things

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that pull us out of our
heart, that pull us out

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.870 align:middle line:90%
of being objective sometimes.

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.270 align:middle line:84%
When we find that
heart-brain harmony,

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.060 align:middle line:84%
when we can create that, and
it's very, very easy to do--

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:41.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to go back
to the other program now.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It gives you an edge.

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:48.330 align:middle line:84%
It gives you the ability to
be more objective, to be--

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:49.130 align:middle line:90%
let's see.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll make sure I
got the right one.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:52.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.360 align:middle line:10%
I want to see if this next--

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.769 align:middle line:10%


00:56:03.769 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:10%
yeah.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.173 align:middle line:10%
And it also does what you're
going to see right here.

00:56:08.173 --> 00:56:09.840 align:middle line:10%
You saw this the other
day, some of you.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:10.715 align:middle line:10%
Some of you have not.

00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:13.410 align:middle line:10%
These are human neurons,
a living human brain.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.362 align:middle line:10%
These are random firings.

00:56:15.362 --> 00:56:17.820 align:middle line:10%
This is typically-- this is
probably what's happening right

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.620 align:middle line:10%
now--

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:20.100 align:middle line:10%
our brain, your brain, my brain.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.475 align:middle line:10%
These are random thoughts
inside of a living human brain.

00:56:22.475 --> 00:56:25.140 align:middle line:10%
This is-- Japanese cameras now
can actually document this.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:27.090 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty wild.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:31.010 align:middle line:10%
Japanese cameras being used
in American universities.

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.400 align:middle line:10%
I like that.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.030 align:middle line:10%
What would happen if we could
harmonize all of those neurons

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:40.020 align:middle line:10%
to fire at the same time and
then take that and apply it

00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:42.660 align:middle line:10%
to our own healing or
to our own intuition,

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:46.250 align:middle line:10%
to access deep states of
awareness or consciousness?

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:90%
What would that do?

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what happens
when we're in no coherence.

00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:52.230 align:middle line:10%
This is-- I love this.

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:56.070 align:middle line:10%
This also is Japanese
cameras in a Russian research

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:58.710 align:middle line:10%
facility being used in
American universities.

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:00.718 align:middle line:10%
True international cooperation.

00:57:00.718 --> 00:57:02.010 align:middle line:10%
Look at this, what's happening.

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:04.800 align:middle line:10%
You're going to see
over 95% of the neurons

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:08.040 align:middle line:10%
in the front of this brain are
going to fire simultaneously.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.960 align:middle line:10%
That is the
equivalent of those--

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.760 align:middle line:10%
right there.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.050 align:middle line:10%
Look at that.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.140 align:middle line:10%
That's the equivalent
of those metronomes

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.030 align:middle line:10%
coming into synchronization.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.830 align:middle line:10%
And you and I are
given the ability

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:24.450 align:middle line:10%
to do that through the power
of coordinating, harmonizing,

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:25.680 align:middle line:10%
creating coherence.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.968 align:middle line:10%
There it is right there
again, one more time.

00:57:27.968 --> 00:57:29.760 align:middle line:10%
So that's what we're
going to do right now.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:30.280 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.350 align:middle line:90%
How do we do it?

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Here it is-- this is a new
technology called glass brain

00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:35.790 align:middle line:90%
technology.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a human brain

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:40.740 align:middle line:84%
showing how different
portions of the brain

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.640 align:middle line:90%
harmonize at different times.

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So right there, you're
seeing in the back,

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:47.950 align:middle line:84%
there's certain portions of
the brain that are harmonizing.

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:48.750 align:middle line:10%
How do we do it?

00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:50.580 align:middle line:90%
There are three steps.

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:51.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to--

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lead you
right through them.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Shift the focus.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Shift the breath.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
shift the way you feel.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.693 align:middle line:90%
I got a bright light here.

00:57:56.693 --> 00:57:57.737 align:middle line:90%
Quick question?

00:57:57.737 --> 00:57:59.070 align:middle line:90%
Quick relevant burning question.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:02.016 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] what causes
the difference [INAUDIBLE]??

00:58:02.016 --> 00:58:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it is
no longer bound.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not bound to
a rigid surface.

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:13.090 align:middle line:90%
It's allowed to move freely.

00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:14.005 align:middle line:90%
It's moving freely.

00:58:14.005 --> 00:58:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:15.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So when we are able to harmonize
our heart and our brain,

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:23.630 align:middle line:84%
we are not bound by our
external environment any longer.

00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's the power of
what we're doing right here.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.380 align:middle line:90%
So I want to do this.

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.513 align:middle line:90%
Laurie, how much time do I have?

00:58:29.513 --> 00:58:30.772 align:middle line:90%
Do I have an hour?

00:58:30.772 --> 00:58:32.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I got so much I
want to share with you.

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:34.313 align:middle line:84%
>> You have an hour
and seven minutes.

00:58:34.313 --> 00:58:36.973 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, when I
was a kid, I actually--

00:58:36.973 --> 00:58:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I may have contributed
to my parents' divorce.

00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, because every time
they would have friends over,

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I would drag all of my science
stuff out of my bedroom

00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.620 align:middle line:90%
laboratory into the living room.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would show them all my
collections of all my rocks

00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and all my fossils
and all my seashells

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and all my butterflies.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And then I would
begin the experiments

00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.100 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes
would lead to fire

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and sparks in very
inappropriate places and times.

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:06.080 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that was
the reason they divorced.

00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.653 align:middle line:90%
But it probably didn't help.

00:59:07.653 --> 00:59:09.070 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like that
when I come here.

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.320 align:middle line:90%
I want to show you everything.

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:11.677 align:middle line:90%
I've got so much we want to do.

00:59:11.677 --> 00:59:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But this is important
because it's all

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.400 align:middle line:84%
going to hinge on what
we're doing right here.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.692 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like to do is,
can we bring our lights down

00:59:17.692 --> 00:59:19.410 align:middle line:90%
a little bit?

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.180 align:middle line:90%
We covered a lot of ground.

00:59:21.180 --> 00:59:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I talked to you about why
the world is changing,

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:25.800 align:middle line:84%
our relationship to
that change, the fact

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.760 align:middle line:84%
that we are literally wired
to thrive in that change

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.460 align:middle line:90%
if we embrace our humanness.

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're only beginning
to understand really

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.240 align:middle line:84%
what that means
through what we are now

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.880 align:middle line:90%
calling soft technology.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:42.020 align:middle line:90%
Every cell in your body--

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.312 align:middle line:90%
I want you to think about this.

00:59:43.312 --> 00:59:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body is like
a little electrical circuit.

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And it does everything
the circuit does.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.960 align:middle line:90%
You store energy.

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.100 align:middle line:90%
You release energy.

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.530 align:middle line:90%
You receive light as photons.

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.750 align:middle line:90%
You emit light as photons.

00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.700 align:middle line:90%
You access memory.

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.770 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability
to share that memory,

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:03.170 align:middle line:90%
to store that memory.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.650 align:middle line:84%
You create very harmonized
systems just the way

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.540 align:middle line:84%
our machines are
doing right now.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.503 align:middle line:84%
And you regulate all of that
through your relationship

01:00:11.503 --> 01:00:12.920 align:middle line:84%
between your heart
and your brain.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.337 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you do
it unconsciously,

01:00:14.337 --> 01:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know
how you're regulating.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.650 align:middle line:84%
To become fully human,
to gain our mastery,

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.110 align:middle line:84%
this is what the mystics and
the yogis and the healers

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.920 align:middle line:84%
and the curanderos and the
monks and the nuns in Tibet--

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.490 align:middle line:84%
this is what they've dedicate
their lives to master.

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your
help with that.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Is how do we access
and harmonize

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
this internal
technology to become

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
the best people we can be?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
What does it really mean to
even be human, to be fully human

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and not be at the whim
of our external world,

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.510 align:middle line:84%
our external environment,
to be our own master,

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to have control of
our own biology?

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of those things
I've said to you,

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
they all begin with
how we apply breath,

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
how we access this relationship
between the heart and the brain

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and our uniquely human
ability to create emotion

01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:09.440 align:middle line:84%
on demand when we feel
like having that emotion.

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.400 align:middle line:90%
One more discovery.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
What's that woman
doing right there?

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yawning.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Yep.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.748 align:middle line:10%
And when you see somebody yawn,
a lot of times what happens?

01:01:15.748 --> 01:01:17.540 align:middle line:10%
I do this from the
stage all-- we come back

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.970 align:middle line:10%
from lunch and everybody goes
out and has beer, wine, pasta,

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:21.830 align:middle line:10%
pizza.

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:24.440 align:middle line:10%
And then they come back into
a warm room for the afternoon.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.180 align:middle line:10%
And I see a lot of that.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.450 align:middle line:10%
And then I see people
next to them doing that.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:33.375 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes it's not
just the people that do it.

01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:35.750 align:middle line:10%
But you know, if you share
your life with any other forms

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
of life, they often will--

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.320 align:middle line:10%
they'll do exactly
the same thing.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:43.680 align:middle line:90%


01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.350 align:middle line:10%
I-- up until July of last year,
I shared my life with a little

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.870 align:middle line:10%
16--

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.040 align:middle line:10%
well, he was a
13-pound kitty that

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:56.640 align:middle line:10%
lived with me 16 years,
my wife and I, that

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.190 align:middle line:10%
slept right here on my chest.

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometime after I would go
to sleep, he would come up.

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
And he'd be right there.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd wake up in the morning,
and his face is right there.

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:07.132 align:middle line:84%
And either way, I'd mess
with him in the morning.

01:02:07.132 --> 01:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd open one eye,
and he opens one eye.

01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'd open the other one,
and he opens the other one.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.575 align:middle line:84%
And I'd open my mouth, and
he'd show me all of his teeth.

01:02:12.575 --> 01:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have
this relationship.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.230 align:middle line:90%
We all know that it happens.

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:18.190 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
why does it happen?

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the greatest mysteries

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and one of the deepest powers
that you have as a human.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, it is
because of a phenomenon

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:31.020 align:middle line:84%
that is called mirror neurons, a
relatively new class of neurons

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:33.603 align:middle line:84%
that were only
discovered in 2004.

01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Guess where they're located.

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Just take a wild Conscious Life
Expo psychic, intuitive guess.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Right in the neocortex that you
were given access to in the way

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.470 align:middle line:90%
that you do 200,000 years ago.

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
Mirror neurons.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Now technically, they are
called cubelli neurons.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you why
they're so special.

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:57.450 align:middle line:84%
A mirror neuron fires when
you have an experience.

01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
So you're out playing
soccer or you're

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
out playing golf or having
wild, passionate sex or playing

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
great rock music
or whatever it is.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Those mirror neurons are firing.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.250 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.100 align:middle line:90%
No surprise there.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.480 align:middle line:90%
But look at this.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.810 align:middle line:84%
They also fire when you
witness someone else

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:15.060 align:middle line:90%
having an experience.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why you could be
lying motionless on your couch

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
on a Sunday afternoon
watching the soccer game.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.227 align:middle line:90%
You're lying down.

01:03:22.227 --> 01:03:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Your heart's beating fast.

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Your muscles are tense.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
You might be perspiring.

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:26.818 align:middle line:84%
But you're just-- I
mean, think about it.

01:03:26.818 --> 01:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
You're just lying there.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
This is why porn is so
powerfully addictive

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.737 align:middle line:84%
and why so many people have
problems because their body--

01:03:34.737 --> 01:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
your brain doesn't
know the difference

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
between watching soccer
and playing soccer,

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
between watching porn
and being in the porn.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:43.860 align:middle line:84%
You're firing off all of those
very addictive chemicals--

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.838 align:middle line:84%
the serotonin, the oxytocin,
the adrenaline all--

01:03:47.838 --> 01:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're very
addictive chemicals.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Your brain for all
intents and purposes

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:53.670 align:middle line:84%
does not know the
difference between watching

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and having the experience.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a really very,
very powerful, powerful

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:03.180 align:middle line:90%
biological process.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Elon Musk is developing computer
chips to put in the human brain

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to mimic what you already
have the ability to do.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I talked about this on Friday.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
And this is the danger.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
The danger is when we begin to
replace our natural abilities

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:19.800 align:middle line:84%
with devices and machines, those
abilities begin to atrophy.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And you don't want to lose this.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
to you about this.

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Where are they located?

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.478 align:middle line:90%
I just gave the answer.

01:04:24.478 --> 01:04:25.710 align:middle line:10%
Here it is right here.

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.050 align:middle line:10%
The mirror neurons right
now, the only ones we know,

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.120 align:middle line:10%
this is where they're
located right here.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.590 align:middle line:10%
All in the neocortex.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:32.900 align:middle line:10%
Everything OK?

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.700 align:middle line:10%
You guys good?

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.120 align:middle line:10%
OK, everybody's
checking stuff out.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.180 align:middle line:10%
I just want to make sure that
I'm not doing something I'm not

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:38.580 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be doing here.

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.280 align:middle line:10%
It's my guilt complex.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.250 align:middle line:10%
It's my performer.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.380 align:middle line:90%
So how powerful are these?

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
a couple of examples.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a person
actually having pain.

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is the part of
the brain right there--

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:54.990 align:middle line:90%
these are the pain centers.

01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
If you are a
therapist or a healer

01:04:57.330 --> 01:05:00.750 align:middle line:84%
or a doctor or a massage
therapist or a body worker,

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.067 align:middle line:84%
you all know that you
empathize with your clients.

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
When you're empathizing,
look what happened.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.390 align:middle line:90%
There's a person empathizing.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Look at their-- not 100%,
but they're feeling--

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:10.860 align:middle line:84%
they're literally
feeling the pain.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They're not just
sympathizing, saying,

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
oh, you know, I really
feel for you, brother.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
They're not doing
that-- or sister.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.450 align:middle line:90%
They're saying, I feel the pain.

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:19.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.070 align:middle line:90%
They are.

01:05:20.070 --> 01:05:20.400 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.900 align:middle line:90%
I love-- this is a musician.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.568 align:middle line:90%
This is a musician.

01:05:23.568 --> 01:05:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Left and the right
side of the brain,

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
trained in music, loves music,
loves to perform the music.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:30.900 align:middle line:10%
Look at the parts of
the brain lighting up.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.780 align:middle line:10%
The next image is
someone that does not

01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:37.170 align:middle line:10%
know how to play an instrument,
is not trained to perform

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.460 align:middle line:10%
but loves music anyway.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.580 align:middle line:90%
And look at this.

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Look at the part--
just a listener.

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Look at the parts-- look
at-- that is 100% identical

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:45.410 align:middle line:90%
right there.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Look at that right there.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the same parts of the brain
right there and right there.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
These are mirror neurons.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.400 align:middle line:90%
These are mirror neurons.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.650 align:middle line:90%
This is what they do.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm sharing with
you the science.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I promised that
I would tell you

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:06.630 align:middle line:84%
when I deviate from
the accepted science.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to
do that right now.

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:12.330 align:middle line:84%
I believe from studying ancient
text this is one of our most

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.295 align:middle line:90%
underutilized potentials.

01:06:14.295 --> 01:06:15.920 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to
share with you now

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.270 align:middle line:84%
many neuroscientists probably
would not agree with me

01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:20.230 align:middle line:90%
yet on the one hand.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Other hand, they don't know
what the mirror neurons are for.

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:26.503 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is unlocking--
the key to unlocking

01:06:26.503 --> 01:06:27.795 align:middle line:90%
some of our greatest potential.

01:06:27.795 --> 01:06:30.720 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to show you Elon
Musk is actually creating--

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.220 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned this
and I talked to you

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.470 align:middle line:10%
about this-- this
chip right here.

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the first chip-- it's
now being manufactured

01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to be implanted in the
human brain that interfaces

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.230 align:middle line:84%
with the brain so
the brain can talk

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.670 align:middle line:90%
to the hard drive of a computer.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
That's not a wire.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It's like Bluetooth technology.

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And young people love this, man.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Gamers love this.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:52.950 align:middle line:90%
They're saying, oh sweet.

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I can play Grand Theft
Auto Number Three

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:59.297 align:middle line:90%
without having to use my cables.

01:06:59.297 --> 01:07:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:02.740 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:06.540 align:middle line:84%
When we begin to replace our
natural abilities with chips,

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
we begin to atrophy
those abilities.

01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I talked about
that on Friday.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to talk
about it anymore now.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
say is we already

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.390 align:middle line:90%
have-- we are the technology.

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think all-- remember
what I said earlier.

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Our creations are reminding us
of something within ourselves.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
happening here.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
We're building
devices and machines

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
that mimic what we
already are to remind us

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:30.330 align:middle line:90%
of what we already are.

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
The question is, will we
embrace our humanness,

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
or are we going to give
our power away forever?

01:07:36.090 --> 01:07:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Once it's gone, it's gone.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I believe this is what the
masters did in the past.

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:46.380 align:middle line:84%
When I-- my first
trip into Tibet,

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:50.130 align:middle line:84%
I chose an overland route
to go to the monasteries

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.410 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to
because I've studied

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:54.645 align:middle line:90%
martial arts since I was a kid.

01:07:54.645 --> 01:07:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm fascinated by not
only the coordination,

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
but the inner
expression of what's

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
happening with the body
in the outer world.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the great
masters was living

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
in a cave in the highlands
of Central Tibet.

01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.200 align:middle line:84%
His name was-- anybody
know who it was?

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Milarepa.

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:18.760 align:middle line:90%
Anybody study Milarepa?

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Love it.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.069 align:middle line:84%
So and I wanted to see
the place where Milarepa

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:24.840 align:middle line:90%
had had his experience.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
If you know the
story-- if you don't

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
know the story of Milarepa, it's
very similar in some respects

01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:31.620 align:middle line:90%
to the story of Buddha.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Both Buddha and Milarepa came
from privileged families.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.569 align:middle line:84%
They were sheltered from a
lot of the evils in the world.

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:42.840 align:middle line:90%
They were families of privilege.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Buddha went into the world
and it changed his life.

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:50.399 align:middle line:84%
Milarepa went to another
village as a student

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:52.890 align:middle line:90%
studying the mystical arts.

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And when he returned
to his village,

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
another army had come and
burned his village to the ground

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:00.779 align:middle line:90%
and killed all of his family.

01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And he was enraged.

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.890 align:middle line:90%
And he sought revenge.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.319 align:middle line:90%
And he tracked down that army.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And when they were not expecting
it, he burned their camp.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And he killed many,
many, many people.

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.069 align:middle line:84%
And he immediately
knew that it was

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:17.939 align:middle line:84%
a misuse of his power, of
what he had been taught to do.

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:18.899 align:middle line:90%
And he retreated.

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:20.792 align:middle line:84%
He renounced all of his
worldly possessions,

01:09:20.792 --> 01:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%
all of his friendships.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:25.920 align:middle line:84%
He retreated to a series of
caves that still exist today

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%
and spent the rest of his life.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
He said, I will only use my
mystical powers for good.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And I will teach any students
that want to come to me.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.819 align:middle line:90%
I will not go to them.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:39.149 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this place
that he performed miracles.

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
see the miracles.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.069 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
miracles remain today.

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:46.290 align:middle line:84%
What Milarepa would
do is when he wanted

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
to help free one of his
students from the limitations--

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
their perceived limitations,
he would walk over

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.935 align:middle line:84%
to the wall of the
cave, the rock wall.

01:09:56.935 --> 01:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And he'd put his hand
against the wall.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.977 align:middle line:84%
And he would just
continue to push

01:09:59.977 --> 01:10:02.130 align:middle line:90%
as if that rock didn't exist.

01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a one
or two-time deal.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all over the
inside of this cave.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.352 align:middle line:84%
And he did it with
his feet as well.

01:10:08.352 --> 01:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
There are-- some
of the impressions

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:10.650 align:middle line:90%
are, like, this deep.

01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:12.775 align:middle line:84%
Some of them-- there's one
that goes all the way up

01:10:12.775 --> 01:10:14.550 align:middle line:90%
to my elbow.

01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:18.060 align:middle line:84%
In his mastery, the
wall of the cave

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.280 align:middle line:84%
was no longer a limit
to his existence.

01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm not limited
by the walls of this stone.

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you see something like
that happen, one of two things

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.160 align:middle line:90%
occurs within you.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.640 align:middle line:10%
You either blow it off and you
discount it because you cannot

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.775 align:middle line:10%
accept what you've seen--

01:10:35.775 --> 01:10:37.150 align:middle line:10%
in this case, you
would no longer

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.010 align:middle line:10%
be a student of Milarepa--

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:42.550 align:middle line:10%
or you change your
belief system to embrace

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:44.050 align:middle line:10%
what you have just seen.

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And now your belief
system is expanded

01:10:46.930 --> 01:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
to allow for that
possibility for you as well.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So the-- Jesus did
this all the time.

01:10:54.330 --> 01:10:55.130 align:middle line:90%
All the time.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.463 align:middle line:10%
This is what the healings were--

01:10:56.463 --> 01:10:59.620 align:middle line:10%
not to impress people,
but to show them

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:01.210 align:middle line:10%
that there was a
power within them

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:04.960 align:middle line:10%
that exceeded what
they had been--

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.810 align:middle line:10%
what they were told were their
limitations, their perceived

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:09.340 align:middle line:10%
limitations.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So when we see something
like this happen,

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
that is precisely
what's going on.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not limited
to the ancient masters.

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not limited to the
miracles of another time,

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:21.050 align:middle line:90%
although it can be.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:23.050 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly-- your brain--

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:24.550 align:middle line:10%
now, I want you to
think about this.

01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:26.133 align:middle line:10%
Your brain doesn't
know the difference

01:11:26.133 --> 01:11:29.860 align:middle line:10%
between witnessing an experience
and living the experience.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.830 align:middle line:10%
Are you with me on that?

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.255 align:middle line:10%
All right, where does
the witnessing occur?

01:11:35.255 --> 01:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%


01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
Your brain doesn't know the
difference between witnessing

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.090 align:middle line:90%
and imagining the experience.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:51.110 align:middle line:84%
If you can see it in your mind's
eye and feel it in your heart,

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
your brain doesn't know
the difference between that

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.793 align:middle line:84%
and you watching that
experience outside of your body.

01:11:56.793 --> 01:11:57.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you.

01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:58.870 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
These are scans of
the brain right here.

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:05.890 align:middle line:84%
That's the top of the
brain, the back, sides.

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:08.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the brain
where someone actually

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:10.563 align:middle line:84%
is reaching with their
arm across the table.

01:12:10.563 --> 01:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Look at the parts of the
brain that are lighting up.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.290 align:middle line:10%
You all can see that.

01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
The next scan is
now someone is--

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:20.590 align:middle line:90%
they're doing the reaching.

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:23.705 align:middle line:84%
Here is where they're watching
someone else do the reaching.

01:12:23.705 --> 01:12:24.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not reaching.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And look at the parts of the
brain that are lighting up.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Can you all see that?

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.340 align:middle line:84%
OK, here's where it
gets really cool.

01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
The next scan is they're
not doing the reaching.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not watching
someone else.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.710 align:middle line:84%
They are imagining themselves
doing the reaching.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Your brain-- it's not 100%.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.280 align:middle line:90%
But look how much it is.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Your brain doesn't
know the difference.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what do you
feed your mirror neurons?

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
What do you feed
your mirror neurons?

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
When you think about yourself
consciously and subconsciously,

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.110 align:middle line:90%
how do you see yourself?

01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the
answer to that is,

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.825 align:middle line:84%
you are giving that
information to the mirror

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
neurons to produce the chemistry
in the body that matches

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.270 align:middle line:90%
what it is that you're seeing.

01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Would you like the opportunity
to update what you're

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:10.200 align:middle line:90%
feeding your mirror neurons?

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, good because we're
going to before our afternoon

01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
is over here.

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Your mirror neurons are
responding to your self image.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And that's the question.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And I ask myself this
question all the time.

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:22.178 align:middle line:84%
What am I feeding
my mirror neurons?

01:13:22.178 --> 01:13:23.220 align:middle line:90%
I-- and many of you know.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.595 align:middle line:84%
I talked a little
bit about this.

01:13:24.595 --> 01:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm the product of a
very dysfunctional,

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
alcoholic family--
abusive alcoholic family.

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
If you ever been in
a family like that,

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:37.252 align:middle line:84%
you are steeped in criticism
that lends to self-doubt.

01:13:37.252 --> 01:13:38.460 align:middle line:90%
No, you know what I'm saying.

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.460 align:middle line:90%
You're steeped in that--

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
the question is,
do you accept that?

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Do you believe what
you're being told?

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:47.860 align:middle line:90%
And if you're a young person--

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I was blessed with a
really strong soul compass.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
I did not believe a
lot of my criticism.

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I have a younger brother,
four years younger.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.370 align:middle line:10%
And God bless him, he
believed everything.

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:01.690 align:middle line:10%
And it is the governing
factor in his life today

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:04.090 align:middle line:10%
for his relationships,
the kind of jobs

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:07.780 align:middle line:10%
he feels that he's worthy of
pursuing, the kind of people

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.640 align:middle line:10%
that he feels that
he's worthy of being

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.010 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of,
the kind of women

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:16.420 align:middle line:10%
that he draws into his
life as life partners.

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It all plays-- and
I've talked to him.

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk to
someone intellectually.

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
But unless you're willing to
really embrace this deep truth,

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like water
rolling off a duck.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
make any difference.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So what do you feed
your mirror neurons?

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to talk to you
about this a little bit.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call this
physics for the advanced soul

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
because you're all
advanced souls.

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.630 align:middle line:90%
And we all like physics.

01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:43.972 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go really fast.

01:14:43.972 --> 01:14:45.180 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE] men and women?

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.022 align:middle line:10%
>> Pardon me?

01:14:46.022 --> 01:14:47.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there a difference
between men and women.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:49.550 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a big difference
between men and women.

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Which one do you
want to talk about?

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:53.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:54.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:55.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know where
that question came from.

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.170 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:56.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:57.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mirror neurons.

01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
mirror neurons, no.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Physiologically were the same.

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the filters and the
perceptions of our maleness

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.720 align:middle line:84%
or femaleness that
interpret what's happening

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.180 align:middle line:84%
or that allow us to feed
those mirror neurons.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:12.430 align:middle line:90%
But the neurons are the same.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:13.840 align:middle line:90%
Neurons are the same.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.695 align:middle line:84%
So your woman-ness would
maybe feed your mirror neurons

01:15:16.695 --> 01:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in a different way than my
man-ness would, or maybe

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
my feminine is going
to match your feminine.

01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:15:21.370 --> 01:15:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Whole workshop that we
could do around that.

01:15:24.210 --> 01:15:26.600 align:middle line:84%
What we now know,
scientists are no longer

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.600 align:middle line:84%
arguing over whether or
not there's a field that

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.440 align:middle line:90%
connects all things.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:30.482 align:middle line:90%
We know that that's true.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:32.190 align:middle line:84%
There's a field that
connects all things.

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
spend much time.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Other speakers have done
a beautiful job with that.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Here's where this gets
interesting is this field--

01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:41.690 align:middle line:84%
it's not a field that--
and scientists do this

01:15:41.690 --> 01:15:42.490 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a field that
connects all things.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
There's this field out there
that connects all things.

01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Guess where the field is.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Every atom of your body
is emerging and collapsing

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
into that field in this
nanosecond right now and again

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.890 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We-- it's not that
the field is in here.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.640 align:middle line:90%
We are the field.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
You and I are wrinkles.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
We are little distortions in
an otherwise homogeneous field.

01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And our consciousness
is what holds

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:23.510 align:middle line:84%
this distorted form called
the human body in that field.

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:26.310 align:middle line:84%
That means we're
part of everything.

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And that means
because those atoms

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and the subatomic
particles are constantly

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.680 align:middle line:84%
emerging and collapsing,
they're not constant,

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.740 align:middle line:84%
it means that they
are malleable.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.610 align:middle line:84%
They follow whatever template,
whatever pattern is there

01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:43.410 align:middle line:90%
when they emerge.

01:16:43.410 --> 01:16:46.250 align:middle line:84%
When that pattern changes, they
emerge as a new expression.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.768 align:middle line:90%
That's why you can change.

01:16:47.768 --> 01:16:49.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where your
healing comes from.

01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:51.080 align:middle line:90%
That's where miracles occur.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the awesome good
news of our soft technology,

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
this awesome biological
technology that rarely

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:00.920 align:middle line:90%
does anyone tell us about.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
That's why you are a master
and not a victim unless you

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
choose to be a victim.

01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
So all potentials exist.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to do
this very, very fast.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I was actually-- this is great.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I was on a plane going
to Cancun two weeks ago.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And everybody on the
plane was wearing

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:24.710 align:middle line:84%
tie-dyed shirts, top hats, and
having a really great time.

01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I
must be involved

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%
in something I'm not aware of.

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yep, it's
a Grateful Dead reunion

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:36.080 align:middle line:84%
conference that's going
on on the beach at Cancun.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.580 align:middle line:90%
We're all deadheads.

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, to
the guy next to me

01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:43.310 align:middle line:84%
in a canary yellow suit
with canary yellow shoes

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and a canary yellow top
hat and a big beard that

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:49.250 align:middle line:84%
looked like the Wizard, I
said, that explains a lot.

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I wish we had had these when
I went to the Dead shows.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
These are awesome.

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:56.120 align:middle line:84%
If you think-- OK, look at
what's happening right now.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:00.240 align:middle line:84%
If this is the
quantum field and you

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.952 align:middle line:84%
can see a pattern
of energy, what

01:18:01.952 --> 01:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is happening to that
pattern right there?

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:05.230 align:middle line:90%
You tell me what's happening.

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it emerging, or is it
coming outward or going inward?

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:09.940 align:middle line:90%
It's collapsing.

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:10.740 align:middle line:90%
It's collapsing.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.730 align:middle line:90%
What is that patt-?

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.820 align:middle line:84%
This is where I'd like
to have the Dead concert.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.350 align:middle line:90%
Man, that was just like, whoa.

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:17.150 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm close to it.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But can you see
what's happening?

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:25.500 align:middle line:10%
OK, this is-- the quantum
field is in constant motion

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.210 align:middle line:10%
of potential.

01:18:27.210 --> 01:18:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Potential.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Everything you can
imagine is in-- it's

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.960 align:middle line:10%
in motion as a
potential in this field.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.510 align:middle line:10%
Your perfect relationship--
you say, oh, there's

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:37.800 align:middle line:10%
my perfect relationship.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.050 align:middle line:10%
It's right there in the field.

01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:40.320 align:middle line:10%
I can see-- oh, there it goes.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.120 align:middle line:10%
It's going.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.490 align:middle line:10%
It's going.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:44.330 align:middle line:10%
My perfect job.

01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:45.140 align:middle line:10%
My perfect job.

01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:46.670 align:middle line:10%
My perfect company.

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:48.380 align:middle line:10%
Oh yeah, well, where did it go?

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.760 align:middle line:10%
Because they're in motion.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They're in constant motion.

01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Can you see this
pattern right here?

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Does it look different
than these two?

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.740 align:middle line:90%
What's it doing?

01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.830 align:middle line:10%
Is it collapsing?

01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:01.550 align:middle line:10%
It's emerging?

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:03.200 align:middle line:10%
It's pulsing in place.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.090 align:middle line:10%
When this energy is no longer
collapsing or expanding,

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:12.200 align:middle line:10%
when it's pulsing in place,
you call that an atom.

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.480 align:middle line:90%


01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:19.410 align:middle line:10%
This is the atom of
your physical reality.

01:19:19.410 --> 01:19:21.240 align:middle line:10%
This is potential.

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:26.670 align:middle line:10%
When you reach in to this
field with your imagination,

01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:31.230 align:middle line:10%
with your vision, and
you see that potential--

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:33.120 align:middle line:10%
all right, now you've got it.

01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
How do you collapse
it into this world?

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:40.290 align:middle line:84%
You collapse it by feeding
it your love or your fear

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:43.320 align:middle line:90%
for what you are imagining.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.180 align:middle line:90%
So here it is.

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:48.690 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at all of the
relationships, all the jobs,

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:51.490 align:middle line:84%
all the health, all the
healing, all the careers.

01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And if your love or your fear--

01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:57.570 align:middle line:84%
these are anchors that
will stop the motion.

01:19:57.570 --> 01:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a pulsing field
of energy in our 3D world.

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.980 align:middle line:90%
That is the atom.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So here's how you
can think of this.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
You can use different languages.

01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
If you're a scientist,
these are scalar waves.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:12.912 align:middle line:84%
That becomes a vector
wave, the real thing.

01:20:12.912 --> 01:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
Or if you're not a scientist,
you say this is a wish.

01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.590 align:middle line:90%
These are possibilities.

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is an empowered
wish or a prayer.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Big concept.

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So the question is when you are
creating using affirmations,

01:20:25.770 --> 01:20:27.180 align:middle line:90%
for example.

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:29.490 align:middle line:10%
There's a huge difference
between working

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:34.030 align:middle line:10%
toward the outcome and
beginning with what you want.

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:37.630 align:middle line:10%
We were taught-- when I
was a kid, my mom told me--

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:39.428 align:middle line:10%
how much time do I have?

01:20:39.428 --> 01:20:40.910 align:middle line:90%
>> You have twenty-four minutes.

01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.140 align:middle line:90%
If I go-- if--

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.330 align:middle line:90%
do we have a hard out?

01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:47.002 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:47.002 --> 01:20:48.210 align:middle line:90%
>> If I go over four minutes?

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.430 align:middle line:90%
Can I go over four minutes?

01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:52.073 align:middle line:90%
I may not need to.

01:20:52.073 --> 01:20:54.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so when I was a kid
here is what my mom told me.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:57.370 align:middle line:84%
She says, if you scrape
your knee on the sidewalk,

01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:59.241 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
heal immediately.

01:20:59.241 --> 01:21:01.205 align:middle line:90%
And guess what.

01:21:01.205 --> 01:21:02.450 align:middle line:90%
It didn't.

01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:04.255 align:middle line:84%
She said it will heal
little by little.

01:21:04.255 --> 01:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It'll heal a little
bit tomorrow.

01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And it'll heal a little bit more
the next day, a little bit more

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.600 align:middle line:90%
the next day, a little bit--

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and I began to
believe that as a kid.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.687 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, my body--
that's exactly the way it

01:21:12.687 --> 01:21:13.487 align:middle line:90%
worked.

01:21:13.487 --> 01:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
When I began to understand
that things work differently--

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's
instantaneously.

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:20.428 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying you can
really change that paradigm.

01:21:20.428 --> 01:21:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I think some of you
are nodding your heads.

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.930 align:middle line:90%
You guys know that.

01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:25.290 align:middle line:90%
What do we feed that field?

01:21:25.290 --> 01:21:28.610 align:middle line:90%
Now there is a movement.

01:21:28.610 --> 01:21:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And my publisher, Hay House--

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been with them
since, oh, well--

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
my first book with them, I met--

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:39.260 align:middle line:84%
they asked me to come
on board in 1998.

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And my first book
with them was in 2003.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So I've been with
them quite a while.

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Hay House has done
a lot of books

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and these little decks
of affirmation cards.

01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:51.350 align:middle line:90%
You all seen those?

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:57.042 align:middle line:84%
They can be powerful if they
are stated in the right way.

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a little
tricky for me.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I actually-- I've taken
examples from my friends

01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.990 align:middle line:90%
and my fellow authors.

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:05.282 align:middle line:90%
And I've crossed the names out.

01:22:05.282 --> 01:22:07.710 align:middle line:90%
So I'm not picking on anybody.

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But I want to show you something
about how these affirmations

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.430 align:middle line:84%
work so that when we
do this on our own

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
here in just a few moments
that you are optimizing

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:21.240 align:middle line:90%
this potential, this language.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You're creating a system
that is open to information;

01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
this powerful, sophisticated,
advanced soft technology;

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing the
heart and the brain;

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.160 align:middle line:84%
using the mirror
neurons to create

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.600 align:middle line:90%
real change in your body.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.840 align:middle line:84%
That is a powerful technology
without any external machines

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:41.963 align:middle line:90%
doing that for you.

01:22:41.963 --> 01:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So let's just-- and
this is kind of fun.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:45.565 align:middle line:84%
Let's just take a look
at a couple of these.

01:22:45.565 --> 01:22:46.690 align:middle line:90%
I want you to look at this.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Here's an-- this is
a great affirmation.

01:22:48.850 --> 01:22:50.120 align:middle line:90%
Look at what it says.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I am open and ready to attract
abundance into my life.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, who doesn't
want abundance?

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
Know what, that would be a
great affirmation, right?

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell me, but does
anybody see a problem with it?

01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:04.200 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, look at this one.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I love this one.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:08.750 align:middle line:10%
I am ready to enjoy
perfect health.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.810 align:middle line:10%
Oh, don't-- the Hay House author
that wrote that, if she knew,

01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:13.415 align:middle line:10%
or he--

01:23:13.415 --> 01:23:17.010 align:middle line:10%
if he or she knew what
I was doing right now.

01:23:17.010 --> 01:23:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Look.

01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:19.725 align:middle line:84%
This one is a little
bit harder to read.

01:23:19.725 --> 01:23:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll read it for you.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:27.130 align:middle line:10%
I am willing to release old
patterns and negative beliefs.

01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:28.750 align:middle line:10%
OK, so let me tell
you how this works.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.700 align:middle line:90%
The universe is very literal.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.057 align:middle line:90%
Very literal.

01:23:32.057 --> 01:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to channel
the universe just

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.500 align:middle line:90%
for a couple of seconds here.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
So I'm the universe.

01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just received
your affirmation.

01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:45.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready-- I'm open and
ready to attract abundance

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
into my life.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.260 align:middle line:90%
So I'm the universe.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:48.370 align:middle line:10%
And here you are.

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:50.310 align:middle line:10%
You're affirming
that you're ready.

01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:52.040 align:middle line:10%
And so here's what I'm saying.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:56.400 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying, I'm really
happy, earth child,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:59.980 align:middle line:10%
that you are open and
ready to attract abundance

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.390 align:middle line:10%
into your life.

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.120 align:middle line:10%
And because I am the
infinite universe,

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:08.170 align:middle line:10%
I will allow precisely what
it is that you've commanded.

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.720 align:middle line:10%
I will allow you to
be open and ready

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.980 align:middle line:10%
and open and ready and open
and ready and open and ready.

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.170 align:middle line:10%
I will-- I am ready
to enjoy perfect--

01:24:17.170 --> 01:24:19.570 align:middle line:10%
I'm so happy, my
earth child, that you

01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:23.780 align:middle line:10%
are ready to enjoy perfect
health and ready and ready

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.580 align:middle line:10%
and--

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:26.710 align:middle line:10%
and when you want that,
when you get around

01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:28.627 align:middle line:10%
to letting me know when
you want it, you know,

01:24:28.627 --> 01:24:31.240 align:middle line:10%
just give me a little clue.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.560 align:middle line:10%
What's missing?

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.480 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.740 align:middle line:10%
>> There's no outcome.

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:37.240 align:middle line:10%
There's no outcome.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.500 align:middle line:10%
These are well-intentioned.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.630 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not making fun
of these people at all.

01:24:40.630 --> 01:24:43.120 align:middle line:10%
But I'm saying, if
you're going to do this,

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.125 align:middle line:10%
it depends on what it is that
you're saying to your body

01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:47.500 align:middle line:10%
and what it is
that you're saying

01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.680 align:middle line:10%
because when you use
these words and the words

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.583 align:middle line:10%
conjure images in your
heart or your mind,

01:24:54.583 --> 01:24:56.500 align:middle line:10%
because your heart can
see as well-- remember,

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:58.708 align:middle line:10%
you've got neurons in the
heart, neurons in the mind.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:01.730 align:middle line:90%
That's a fast afternoon.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Those mirror neurons
are going to trigger

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry in your
body for whatever it

01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:06.680 align:middle line:90%
is that you are creating.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.480 align:middle line:90%
And if you're creating this--

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to enjoy--

01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:15.290 align:middle line:84%
I know people who have
been really sick, cancer,

01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and they're relying on new
thought, new age modalities

01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:21.980 align:middle line:84%
which can be
effective if they are

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.180 align:middle line:90%
used correctly and properly.

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
I have friends that are
no longer in this world.

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.710 align:middle line:90%
They died.

01:25:27.710 --> 01:25:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They said, I'm going to
go the holistic route.

01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's cool.

01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:35.480 align:middle line:84%
But they never followed through
with the solid principles

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.940 align:middle line:90%
of what holism means.

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And they died learning.

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to follow
these kinds of things,

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.360 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not saying don't.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying let's give
our body-- your body

01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:49.280 align:middle line:90%
is so amazingly intelligent.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.220 align:middle line:90%
It wants to heal.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.890 align:middle line:84%
It has everything
it-- your body is

01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:54.320 align:middle line:84%
more in healing modality
than it's not until something

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.710 align:middle line:90%
gets in the way.

01:25:55.710 --> 01:25:57.365 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
heard we begin to die

01:25:57.365 --> 01:25:58.490 align:middle line:90%
from the moment we're born?

01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:59.370 align:middle line:90%
You ever heard that?

01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:00.170 align:middle line:90%
I was told that.

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:00.970 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:02.060 align:middle line:90%
That is complete crap.

01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Here is the truth.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Here's the truth.

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.720 align:middle line:84%
The truth is you begin to
heal even before you're born.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You begin healing in
your mother's womb.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
programmed to heal.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.240 align:middle line:90%
And you continue to heal.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.930 align:middle line:84%
From the moment that you
emerge, the cells in your body

01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
are in a healing modality until
something compromises them.

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And our job is to
get out of the way

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and allow our bodies do what
it is that they know how to do.

01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:31.370 align:middle line:90%
So you tell me.

01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:35.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a trick question,
I'll tell you right now.

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:37.090 align:middle line:10%
What would be a more
positive way to say this?

01:26:37.090 --> 01:26:39.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm asking because
I'm going to invite

01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:43.210 align:middle line:10%
us to go into this space of
heart-brain coherence and use

01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:46.330 align:middle line:10%
mirror neurons and create
something for ourselves.

01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:48.130 align:middle line:10%
And this principle
will be important.

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:48.970 align:middle line:10%
Just-- you can
just shout it out.

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:49.887 align:middle line:10%
What would be-- what--

01:26:49.887 --> 01:26:52.954 align:middle line:10%
[CHATTER]

01:26:52.954 --> 01:26:55.920 align:middle line:10%


01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.722 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:26:56.722 --> 01:26:58.680 align:middle line:10%
>> I have perfect health.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.760 align:middle line:10%
>> All of those
could be effective.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:05.260 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.540 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, you're close.

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:10.120 align:middle line:10%
All of those can be effective.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But think about
the slide about two

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:16.990 align:middle line:84%
slides back where
in a linear world

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.910 align:middle line:90%
you work toward the outcome.

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
In a quantum world, you
begin with the outcome.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, you would say
thank you for the perfect--

01:27:26.050 --> 01:27:26.850 align:middle line:90%
for the health--

01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:28.475 align:middle line:84%
the perfect health
that already exists.

01:27:28.475 --> 01:27:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that difference?

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I know people that--
one step removed, people

01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that say-- in meditation,
they say, I give

01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.990 align:middle line:90%
thanks for my perfect health.

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.990 align:middle line:90%
That can be good.

01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:40.360 align:middle line:90%
But look at what you're doing.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.440 align:middle line:84%
I give thanks for
my perfect health.

01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.240 align:middle line:90%
OK, say that.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I give thanks for
my perfect health.

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.245 align:middle line:84%
>> I give thanks for
my perfect health.

01:27:46.245 --> 01:27:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, thank you for my health.

01:27:49.330 --> 01:27:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for my perfect--
you see that difference?

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Direct, personal thank you.

01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:56.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a powerful, powerful sense.

01:27:56.830 --> 01:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
When you say I give thanks,
that's-- it's very proper.

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
That's very cool.

01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:03.490 align:middle line:84%
The universe says, oh,
I'm very happy that you're

01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:04.780 align:middle line:90%
giving thanks.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no incorrect way.

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:11.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm sharing with you principles.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm inviting you to embrace
those principles in your life.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And what I just said to
you, when you directly say

01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:18.650 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:20.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to your body.

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.786 align:middle line:84%
You know, you think you're an
individual, and you're not.

01:28:23.786 --> 01:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
You're actually a community
of about 50 trillion cells

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.397 align:middle line:90%
that's all working together.

01:28:28.397 --> 01:28:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I've got this community
that's called Gregg.

01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.570 align:middle line:90%
And I thank Gregg every day.

01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I went the other day
after my keynote.

01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.292 align:middle line:90%
And I went up to my room.

01:28:35.292 --> 01:28:38.000 align:middle line:90%
And I said, thank you, Gregg.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for working with
me to honor the people that

01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:43.120 align:middle line:90%
came to be in the room.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.480 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Very-- it's very direct, OK?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So what I'd like to do--

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Laurie, my timekeeper,
what I have

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:53.532 align:middle line:90%
like 15 minutes, 20 minutes?

01:28:53.532 --> 01:28:54.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You have 15 minutes.

01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:55.990 align:middle line:90%
See?

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:59.530 align:middle line:10%
I took that name
out right there.

01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:02.680 align:middle line:10%
So the key is this.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.720 align:middle line:10%
If you're going to
have an affirmation,

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.350 align:middle line:10%
you want to feel as if
the outcome is already

01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:11.197 align:middle line:10%
present, feel as if your
prayer's already answered,

01:29:11.197 --> 01:29:13.780 align:middle line:10%
your body's already healed, the
relationship is already there,

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.280 align:middle line:10%
your abundance is
already present.

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And you invoke all of
the senses that you can.

01:29:17.410 --> 01:29:20.073 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
mental experience.

01:29:20.073 --> 01:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
That must be a good picture.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.677 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got
their cameras up.

01:29:22.677 --> 01:29:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to get out of the way.

01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:26.680 align:middle line:90%


01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to
give you a formula.

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to put
all this together brilliantly,

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
transparently, expertly.

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have a great
experience in here.

01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Does it make sense
what we've said so far?

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
You all good with this?

01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:40.750 align:middle line:90%
I know it's fast.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.367 align:middle line:90%
It's very high level.

01:29:42.367 --> 01:29:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Two and a half hours
seems like a long time,

01:29:44.200 --> 01:29:45.310 align:middle line:90%
but it actually goes by--

01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:47.360 align:middle line:84%
didn't our day go
by pretty quickly?

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's not done yet.

01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Here's the formula.

01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And you say, if the mirror
neurons are so powerful,

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.530 align:middle line:84%
how come they don't kick
in for me all of the time?

01:29:56.530 --> 01:29:58.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the answer.

01:29:58.090 --> 01:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you are creating the
environment within your body

01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to optimize this
internal technology.

01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:07.430 align:middle line:90%
And here's how we do it.

01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we're going
to do-- be very familiar.

01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:12.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to create
heart-brain coherence.

01:30:12.730 --> 01:30:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And from that
heart-brain coherence,

01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:16.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to invite you--

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I'll lead you through a process.

01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to invite you,
because your brain doesn't

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:26.140 align:middle line:84%
know the difference between
visualizing and having

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.820 align:middle line:90%
the experience.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And the key is once you
have that to bring it

01:30:34.330 --> 01:30:37.600 align:middle line:84%
into your world, to
breathe life through what

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.550 align:middle line:90%
is called elevated emotion.

01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Our ancestors knew this.

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:43.480 align:middle line:90%
Elevated emotion.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.380 align:middle line:90%
What are the keys?

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.740 align:middle line:84%
You evoke the senses,
movement, feeling.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:49.210 align:middle line:90%
The keys to elevated emotion--

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:52.040 align:middle line:84%
every ancient temple that
I've studied has one of these.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Look what-- what's that
woman doing right there?

01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Drumming.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
What's that woman
doing right there?

01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Drumming.

01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And have you noticed
they're feminine?

01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:01.340 align:middle line:84%
What's this woman
doing right here?

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>> drumming.

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>> What's that woman
doing right there?

01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:04.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Drumming.

01:31:04.398 --> 01:31:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And look at all these women.

01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Typically the feminine
energy is drumming,

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.840 align:middle line:84%
drumming to create
the elevated emotion

01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:14.270 align:middle line:90%
for whatever the process is.

01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Elevated emotion is the key
to anchoring in your being

01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:24.170 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you envision,
what you sense, what you feel,

01:31:24.170 --> 01:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
what you hope to
bring into your life.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It's the missing link.

01:31:29.210 --> 01:31:31.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough to see it.

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:35.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the invitation to come
into this world, into this life.

01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:40.920 align:middle line:90%


01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Could you feel a
shift in your body?

01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.600 align:middle line:90%
[MURMURING]

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:44.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.760 align:middle line:90%


01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.910 align:middle line:90%
This was brief.

01:31:48.910 --> 01:31:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It was high level.

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you a
sense of the power

01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:56.800 align:middle line:84%
of this technology that you
embody by walking this earth.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through this
shift, this change, and people

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
around us that do not
understand what you understand,

01:32:06.650 --> 01:32:12.660 align:middle line:84%
in their fear, try to share
that fear with others.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to invite you to
come back to these moments

01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and to recall the gift
that you were given

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago for just
this time that allows you not

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:32.290 align:middle line:90%
to survive, but to transcend.

01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's as simple
as being human.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:39.060 align:middle line:84%
The key is to embrace
what it means to be human.

01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:40.092 align:middle line:90%
And we're all students.

01:32:40.092 --> 01:32:41.550 align:middle line:84%
We're only beginning
to understand.

01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:43.837 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I wanted
to say to you today.

01:32:43.837 --> 01:32:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for spending two
and a half hours of your life

01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:47.310 align:middle line:90%
with me.

01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:48.180 align:middle line:90%
I love you all.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all so
much for being here.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.536 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:51.536 --> 01:32:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you.

01:32:53.670 --> 01:32:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:55.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
