which I can't explain.

00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
One was where the crop was
lying perhaps 30 centimeters

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:46.730 align:middle line:90%
off the ground.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if the
stems of the wheat

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.190 align:middle line:90%
had been steamed over.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:55.740 align:middle line:90%

It grew normally
until the day before.

Then overnight, it
seemed to undergo

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:03.715 align:middle line:90%
some really peculiar change.

What I noticed in
the field in Pewsey

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.500 align:middle line:84%
were we had what I would
call a ghost circle.

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The crop grew horizontally
up until the first node.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And there, it bent at
an angle of 45 degrees,

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.180 align:middle line:90%
right on the node.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.115 align:middle line:84%
And you can see how
difficult it is for me

00:35:34.115 --> 00:35:35.900 align:middle line:90%
to make it bend on the node.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.670 align:middle line:84%
And then when it got
to the second node,

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.610 align:middle line:90%
it bent again at 45 degrees.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that is
that the crop in the circle

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:84%
was lower than the main crop
by about 15 centimeters.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So you had a very distinct
circle, 15 centimeters lower

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.250 align:middle line:84%
than the rest of the crop,
although the circle was still

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:90%
standing corn.

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Now I can't explain
how that happened.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I certainly can't explain
how it happened overnight.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.240 align:middle line:84%

be done by the man or machine

It's suggesting to me that some
kind of an energetic process

has happened there to
cause those plants to lay

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.820 align:middle line:84%

them all out as if water

The principal effect
on the plants,

which caused them to
lay down, was some form

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.270 align:middle line:10%

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:10%
the plans in very rapid bursts,
