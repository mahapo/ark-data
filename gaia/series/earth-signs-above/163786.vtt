It's how much you can do

The greatest danger
of doing a drawing

and grinding to a halt.
And if you got too tired,

But the other way to
answer that question

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%

>> I'd love to have enough
money to fund a team of people

00:42:48.897 --> 00:42:50.980 align:middle line:84%
to come out and help me
make a really big drawing.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.780 align:middle line:90%
That is my dream.

00:42:51.780 --> 00:43:01.820 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Back to California where
Andres Amador is doing just

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that, directing a team to
create a new collective form

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:09.510 align:middle line:90%
of artwork.

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Inhale from the Earth.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And exhale, forward
roll down to the ground,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.440 align:middle line:90%
touching the ground.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And then inhale, slowly
rolling up from the Earth.

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Bring the energy up.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.815 align:middle line:84%
And exhale, reaching up to the
sky, pushing energy to the sky.

00:43:27.815 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I called
them the prayer artworks,

00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:38.100 align:middle line:84%
because it really felt like
I was engaging in a living

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.210 align:middle line:90%
prayer, a prayer in action.

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.170 align:middle line:84%
But prayer feels very
religious, and what I'm doing

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:47.640 align:middle line:90%
is not about religion.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.650 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's about
spirituality in the sense

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that it is about how we can
engage life at a deeper level,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:84%
at a higher level, at a
more fulfilling level.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Start to lift.

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Lift, lift, lift,
lift, lift, lift.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.540 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.850 align:middle line:90%
It is kind of a strenuous job.

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.475 align:middle line:84%
See how you're still
make a deep gouge?

00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:13.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's still too deep.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> They start out by tracing
outlines for the principle

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.270 align:middle line:90%
heavy shadings.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:22.685 align:middle line:84%
On the beach, only the
deeper marks will be seen.

00:44:22.685 --> 00:44:25.312 align:middle line:84%
Light footprints will be
invisible from the sky.

00:44:25.312 --> 00:44:28.410 align:middle line:90%


00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.220 align:middle line:90%
How is that going?

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.145 align:middle line:90%
Does that feel OK?

00:44:30.145 --> 00:44:30.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you do
more on this one?

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Same technique.

00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Same thing.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.290 align:middle line:84%
To Ron, I'm going to
have you do spirals.

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:middle line:90%


00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.610 align:middle line:84%
Even with myself, I need to be
able to let go of the result.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.530 align:middle line:10%
But even more so when I
do it with anyone else,

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:07.032 align:middle line:10%
I'll have the desire to
have it be a certain way.

00:45:07.032 --> 00:45:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And people interpret what
I'm saying differently.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:14.645 align:middle line:90%
They have different abilities.

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Those can be
moments where I have

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.185 align:middle line:84%
to remember that all
things are impermanent.

00:45:19.185 --> 00:45:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The first impression
is startling,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.830 align:middle line:84%
and reveals a
promising creation.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Andres Amador is a master
of the art, sand art.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to do another layer,
because the water's receded out

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.200 align:middle line:84%
enough that we
can do a few more.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It'll kind of fade
into the back there.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:53.870 align:middle line:90%
That's cool.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:90%


00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you get your
moves and you get into it,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.590 align:middle line:90%
it's literally a dance.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.160 align:middle line:90%
It's-- not-- It was so good.

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like in between
painting, dancing,

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.080 align:middle line:90%
and some sort of Tai Chi.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.300 align:middle line:90%
It literally puts you in a flow.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.297 align:middle line:84%
We're going to, I think,
come together in the center,

00:46:26.297 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:90%
or as close to center as we can.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And the petals layer
from the center.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.018 align:middle line:84%
And I'll do, like, a zoom
back and do a picture.

00:46:33.018 --> 00:46:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:44.430 align:middle line:84%
When I do my art,
the people who see it

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.220 align:middle line:90%
are affected in some way.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.620 align:middle line:90%
And they're going to go out.

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
carry on in their day

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.640 align:middle line:84%
with a slight shift
in their being,

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
affect the next person.

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.450 align:middle line:84%
In the end, everything's
impermanent.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Our lives are impermanent.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And everything around
us is impermanent.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Our friends, the work we do.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Anything we can create
will eventually fade away

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and will be forgotten.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a
terrifying thought.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
It can have us
reach out for things

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:84%
that will give us
some kind of solidity.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, that's
all an illusion.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Security is an illusion.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And until we can make
peace with the fact

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:33.970 align:middle line:84%
of ultimately our
own mortality, I

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.000 align:middle line:90%
don't think we're truly living.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I think we somehow--

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.040 align:middle line:84%
there's a tension inside
of us that we're holding,

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't really
allow us to be free.

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:52.460 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.860 align:middle line:84%
I've done these
artworks as memorials

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:58.460 align:middle line:84%
where people are coming
together to remember

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.840 align:middle line:90%
someone who has died.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And we create something
beautiful together.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And then with the knowledge
that it will wash away,

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.202 align:middle line:84%
which really is kind
of the passage of life.

00:48:11.202 --> 00:48:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Land art is a creative
experience where energies

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.190 align:middle line:90%
converge.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Permanent or temporary,
solid like rock or as fragile

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.690 align:middle line:84%

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.270 align:middle line:90%
