the Nazca Lines are
certainly the most famous.

However, upon arrival,
there is just a desert

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:84%
plain to be found, a
jumble of stones and dust

This is where El Tela, the
weaving loom, is to be found.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the rare geoglyphs
that can be closely approached,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and which allows
us to understand

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:90%
how these lines were traced.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> In reality, it's very simple.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:84%
The stones are pushed to the
sides and the center is swept.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.150 align:middle line:84%
This means that a layer which
has more white clay in it

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
stands out against
the dark surface.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:90%
This is how the lines were made.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It's really not
very complicated.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the lines could have
been made with simple tools

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:84%
such as stakes of
wood and ropes.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.320 align:middle line:84%
But their precision proves
that the Nazca civilization

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:90%
understood mathematics.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Many people, like
Eduardo, are convinced

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.130 align:middle line:84%
that the Nazcas had some way
of getting up high so they

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:90%
could check their work.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> From the ground, they're
not easy to make out.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%

here is rather shapeless.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But the further up
in the sky you are,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.080 align:middle line:84%
the easier it is to see
what these people were

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.065 align:middle line:90%
trying to say to us.

00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask me whether the
ancient people could fly,

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:90%
I would say yes.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I think they used kites made
from canvas and feathers

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.540 align:middle line:90%

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:84%

their incredible longevity.

without anyone
looking after them.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The first reason for
that is geographic.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The lines are in the most
arid desert on the planet,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:84%
where it never rains and
where vegetation is rare.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
The absence of humidity means
there is very little erosion.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But sandstorms can also
play a part in this.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> All the surface dust is
pulled off as if the lines were

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.725 align:middle line:90%
being swept.

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So after one of
these storms, I like

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.505 align:middle line:84%
to fly my microlight
because it's possible

00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:14.600 align:middle line:84%
that the winds have
made new marks visible.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the ancient people knew
about this effect of the wind

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.745 align:middle line:84%
and used it as a maintenance
system to keep the lines clear.

the great straight lines

are the first that we can see.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:84%
They seem to stretch
out for kilometers.

Smaller designs can also
be seen, some of which

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.210 align:middle line:90%
represent animals.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The monkey, the spider,
and the hummingbird

How can these marks be
so precise, so straight?

of these symbols?

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
Why did this tradition of line
tracing last over 1,000 years?

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And everyone at Nazca
has their own explanation

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.934 align:middle line:90%
of the lines' origin.

00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:84%

figures in this particular part

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.950 align:middle line:84%
of Britain is because the
topsoil is quite thin.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
white chalk, and then you

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.170 align:middle line:90%
have a thin layer of soil.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.500 align:middle line:84%

see the white chalk.

We don't know since
when, but we do

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
know it has been here for
several thousand years.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We can't decode all
of this precisely

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.362 align:middle line:84%
because our wise
men, the [SPANISH],,

00:17:55.362 --> 00:17:57.810 align:middle line:90%
are no longer with us.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.160 align:middle line:84%
They left when the
conquistadors arrived.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So amongst all the signs that
are here, there are only four

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
we can easily recognize and that
we still use in our weaving.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Like the water king, which
is represented by the toad.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:84%
We can also recognize the
marriage symbol, these two

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
little doves, which allow us
to see clearly which is the man

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and which is the woman.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the llama, which
is a very important animal, part

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.150 align:middle line:84%
of life for indigenous
Aymaran society.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:38.550 align:middle line:84%
There is also the sign
we call [SPANISH],, which

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol we recognize and
preserve because it represents

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:90%
the direction of life.

The Nazca Lines were only
rediscovered in 1924,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:84%
when planes began to
fly over South America.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
But after 100 years of research,
their exact significance

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.850 align:middle line:90%
remains an enigma.

It was a woman,
Maria Reiche, who

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.780 align:middle line:84%
began to really
study the geoglyphs

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.880 align:middle line:90%
in a scientific fashion.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:84%
After many years of study, Maria
Reiche ended up with a theory

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that the lines are a
sort of star calendar,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
and their orientation
is linked to the stars.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Maria Reiche discovered
that some of the lines

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:84%
pointed to the solstice,
like those which crossed

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:90%

against the king.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.680 align:middle line:84%
He saw the slaughter

When he finally

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.850 align:middle line:84%

After that, the piles of stones

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.690 align:middle line:84%
At the Palpa site, we've

had been made on

where there's a lot of erosion,
sometimes rain, people passing

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.130 align:middle line:84%
by, earth movements, and
also dust and wind which

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:38.930 align:middle line:90%
caused erosion.

We identified several different
groups, such as this one here,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.550 align:middle line:84%
which has been restored
by putting the stones back

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.280 align:middle line:84%

have fallen inside the
figures and putting them back

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:84%
on the sides so that the figure
keeps its original contours,

be seen from far off.

It's a technique which
we use for buildings,

it's the first time

on the stone with
brushes and nothing else,

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and in some cases when
we're restoring them

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.200 align:middle line:84%
we use a little water to
clean the stones so as

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:90%
to make them more visible.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Nothing more.

More than 250,000 people come
each year to visit the site

>> Nice.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.120 align:middle line:84%
One is that if you stand in the
eye of the horse and you spin

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:47.660 align:middle line:84%
round three times, it
will bring you luck.

will tell you off.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Erosion is one of
our biggest problems.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:59.465 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all this, this is
because of people stepping.

We ask don't step on the
horse, so they step here.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you multiply
this by thousands.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:84%
This is why you get marks
like this and like that.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:12.240 align:middle line:90%
It's where people step.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Every time.

It's not the story.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:11.120 align:middle line:90%
We want to do it.
