often have an outcropped
side and a quarried side,

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
when the light is
relatively even.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The morning is ideal, so
as not to have shadows cast

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.590 align:middle line:90%
or contrast too strong.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to photograph
the zone entirely,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
taking shots from every angle,
and then to reconstitute it

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.650 align:middle line:90%
all using 3D software.

These blue squares are
the camera positions.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
This here is a faithful
model and carefully oriented,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:84%
because our concern here is
to have a perfectly precise

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
orientation, so
afterwards, we can

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:90%
simulate the course of the sun.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:14.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So here we have an arc, which
corresponds to the sun's

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:90%
position each hour.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:24.170 align:middle line:90%

Here, in 4000 BC,
and in comparison

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.380 align:middle line:84%
with today's situation,
in the morning,

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.622 align:middle line:84%
we have in this direction, the
sun which rises at the angle,

00:24:32.622 --> 00:24:34.705 align:middle line:84%
and in the evening, the
sun will set at the angle.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:84%

ancestors was certainly aware

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:84%
of the natural phenomena
that gave rhythm to working

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:90%
the land.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Some megalithic sites could
have served as observatories

to measure the course of the
sun and cycle of the seasons.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, to know whether these
sites were oriented in this way

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.050 align:middle line:84%
with that idea in
mind, to know if that

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.260 align:middle line:84%
was the initial
idea, the objective,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.592 align:middle line:84%
is difficult to say
one way or the other.

00:25:07.592 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If saying that they
could have been

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
part of a kind of spatial and
temporal marker, I think so.

00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Felix Gaillard protected and
restored the site in 1887,

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and what's important is that he
wrote about it 10 years later

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
and published a book,
which was quite important,

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:90%
called "Prehistoric Astronomy."

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And the fact the site
was perfectly oriented

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.610 align:middle line:84%
towards the solstices
fits the theory perfectly.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It was widely said that
the site was intentionally

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
replaced so that it corresponded
very well to the theory.

has come to make his own
examination of the site

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:84%
because for him, the astral
orientation of Crucuno remains

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.088 align:middle line:90%
uncertain.

00:26:09.088 --> 00:26:12.524 align:middle line:90%

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.190 align:middle line:84%

more than a simple rectangle.

00:26:23.618 --> 00:26:28.515 align:middle line:84%
I've worked on the archives,
and it gets really interesting.

00:26:28.515 --> 00:26:29.890 align:middle line:84%
There are big
surprises that when

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:84%
you study the plan
made by Murray Vicars,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
you see that instead of
there being 22 monoliths,

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:84%
there are 50 or so,
and they don't at all

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:90%
form a structure like that.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.060 align:middle line:84%

is that, that, that, and that.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Known as the Stonehenge
of the North,

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.016 align:middle line:84%
this stone circle is
found on Lewis Island

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
in the extreme
north of Scotland.

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Its very special location
leads to our thinking

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:84%
that the structure is
linked to the lunar cycle.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:10%
>> The Isle of Lewis is actually
on 58 degrees north alignment.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:47.230 align:middle line:10%
So the lunar standstill
only happens at 58 degrees.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The only other place it
happens is 58 degrees south

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:90%
in Cape Horn, in southern Chile.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.370 align:middle line:84%
So you know,
Callanish, part of it

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.438 align:middle line:84%
was built specifically with
that lunar alignment in mind.

00:27:57.438 --> 00:28:00.840 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Lunar alignments only
happens every 18.9 years,

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's when the
moon is closest

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:90%
to the horizon, how it skims.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's a set
of hills over there

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.720 align:middle line:84%
that actually looks like a
woman lying on their back.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And during the lunar
standstill, the moon

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.460 align:middle line:90%
skirts the hills there.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> This astonishing display
inspired artist Christina

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Walczuk, and she became quite
passionate about the site.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.450 align:middle line:10%
>> This figure has the
name "Sleeping Woman"

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:10%
or "Old Woman of the Moon."

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.530 align:middle line:84%
so from this point,
it looks like the moon

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is born from the figure and
then glides across the sky

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and disappears behind this
hill and then this reborn.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're standing at
the bottom of the avenue,

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.550 align:middle line:84%
it looks like it
sinks into the ring,

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's an absolutely
spectacular event.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to recreate
that in my painting.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:03.310 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The orientation of Callanish,
according to the lunar axis,

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.630 align:middle line:84%
has attracted attention
since antiquity.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a Greek historian
called Diodorus that mentioned

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.980 align:middle line:84%
that there was a lunar temple
on this kind of 58-degree north

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.010 align:middle line:90%
alignment.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>> According to other
ancient manuscripts,

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Callanish was the place where
the goddess of the moon visited

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Earth every 19 years.

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:33.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it was to capture
the power of the moon

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.289 align:middle line:84%
that the people of the north
raised this stone circle there,

00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:84%
where the full solstice moon
touched the mountain tops.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:84%
Raised in 3000 BC, this
site is unique in Europe,

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
because it brings together in
one place all three main forms

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.470 align:middle line:84%
of megalithic
structures, alignments,

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:90%
stone circles, and a tomb.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what you
call the chamber tomb,

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
which was inserted after the
monolith and the stone circle.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.470 align:middle line:84%
This would have had burials
in there, communal burials.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Burying the dead was
a major cultural, social,

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual development for
our ancestors 5,000 years ago.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The Neolithic see an entire
reworking of the relationship

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.090 align:middle line:90%
of people with nature.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Before, in the Mesolithic,
you were part of nature.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:90%
You moved around the landscape.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Your special places
were natural places.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Neolithic, when you
start settling in one place,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:35.080 align:middle line:84%
they start building
monuments, you know?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And this is that relationship,
we own this land.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.950 align:middle line:84%
This is why we turn to
cairns we built on hills.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:90%
These are our ancestors.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.970 align:middle line:90%
This is our land.

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> As for many megalith
sites, the placing of the site

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of Callanish within its
landscape has been thought out.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You often find stone circles
very close to water bodies.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's this liminality
between the living and the dead

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.844 align:middle line:84%
and the water and
the land that seems

00:31:01.844 --> 00:31:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to be so important to the
monument builders of stone

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
circles.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.520 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The representations
which guided the conception

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of Callanish have been revisited
5,000 years later by Christina

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Walczuk.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:17.824 align:middle line:84%
In the gallery she runs
with her husband Roger,

00:31:17.824 --> 00:31:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the paintings on show are
full of symbolic elements.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:25.260 align:middle line:90%


00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I like to get the
emotional point of view,

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual point of view.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be a
figurative artist,

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
now I try and pick out
the figurative element

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in the landscape and the stones.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:41.260 align:middle line:84%
I included the crow flying,
because in Celtic methodology,

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.020 align:middle line:84%
it represents death,
and this figure

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:90%
looks like it's a skeleton.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So we actually see
this as something

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that dies and is reborn in
relationship to the moon.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I personally think it's a
woman who's just given birth.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the skeleton,
who implies death,

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and I like to think
this is life, death,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.730 align:middle line:90%
and the cycle of life.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:11.646 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.646 --> 00:32:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> While Christina puts the
finishing touches to her latest

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.996 align:middle line:84%
work, Roger goes to the
site looking for symbols.

00:32:18.996 --> 00:32:24.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up to the stones now,
some people have noticed images

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
on the stones,
and we're artists,

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
we're interested in.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you noticed
here there's an image of a face,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.550 align:middle line:84%
like a woman's face, a bit
like an Egyptian sort of face.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:90%
This, we call the Woman Stone.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:42.560 align:middle line:84%
From inside, this one we
refer to as the male stone

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's obviously
very phallic.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The female stone
and the male stone

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:51.320 align:middle line:84%
work together to form a box,
those shelves there from a box,

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.190 align:middle line:84%
where the midsummer sunrise,
just after it, shines

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.540 align:middle line:90%
a beam of light to this stone.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:01.520 align:middle line:84%
It's bringing the adages
of the sun into the ring.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Lost in the middle of the
Scottish lochs and heaths,

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.940 align:middle line:84%
the site has a rare
strength and poetic quality.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.494 align:middle line:84%
It can't help inspiring artists
and firing the imagination.

00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Roger crisscrosses the
site and allows inspiration

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.430 align:middle line:90%
to carry him away.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> There would be the point,
that box, the equinox,

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.540 align:middle line:84%
it echoes the shape of the
landscape, that ridge there,

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:33.090 align:middle line:90%
that notch.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.187 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
midwinter sun sets.

00:33:35.187 --> 00:33:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you would
actually go like that when

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.360 align:middle line:84%
something's dazzling you,
yeah, to sort of stop it

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.780 align:middle line:90%
from dazzling you.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think they made that
stone deliberately to hide it,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:84%
because it was
hurting their eyes.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
This stone, I think,
represents revering

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.430 align:middle line:84%
the dead, because it seems
like a skeleton, yeah?

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's like revering the
dead near the cairn here.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps why the later
people built the cairn

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.060 align:middle line:84%
here because of this
stone with this image on.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The big stone in the
center, some people

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.460 align:middle line:84%
have suggested it's
like a rudder of a boat,

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
you know, the steering
part of a boat,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to steer the spirits of
the dead to the stars.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The Callanish,
which affects us today,

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.070 align:middle line:84%
is the work of people who
have mastered the cycle

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
of the seasons,
observed the stars,

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and voyaged on the ocean.

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Could these stones standing
on the hills of Scotland

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.211 align:middle line:84%
be simply the symbol of a
megalithic civilization?

00:34:34.211 --> 00:34:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This stone circle here
is just part of the Atlantic

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:84%
tradition, which you will
have links all the way down

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.604 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantic coast.

00:34:40.604 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of evidence to
suggest that people are moving

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.728 align:middle line:84%
up and down the Atlantic
seaways but also

00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:46.529 align:middle line:90%
ideas and traditions as well.

00:34:46.529 --> 00:34:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Some thousands of
kilometers to the south,

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.281 align:middle line:84%
like an echo to Callanish,
silhouettes of stones are lost

00:34:56.281 --> 00:34:57.081 align:middle line:90%
in the sea.

00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Witness to the changes in the
landscape over 5,000 years,

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.800 align:middle line:84%
these half-drowned arcs of
standing stones intrigue us.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Sited in the Gulf of Morbihan,
the island of Er Lannic

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.090 align:middle line:84%
has been declared
a natural reserve.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.070 align:middle line:84%
It is only accessible
by sea, and it

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:90%
is forbidden to set foot there.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So Laurent Lescop is
taken there in a boat

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.506 align:middle line:84%
by Yves Belenfant, who
knows the place well.

00:35:22.506 --> 00:35:26.790 align:middle line:90%


00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a double
semi-circle really.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not completely
two arcs of a circle.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So there we can see the
first, and the second you

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
can't see, because it's
completely immersed.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Here, we're at full tide.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.105 align:middle line:84%
So at full tide, they're at
about three to four meters

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:40.905 align:middle line:90%
maximum.

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:44.816 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.816 --> 00:35:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The monoliths that we see
here in the first arc,

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:50.770 align:middle line:84%
well, there's a big one
there, the one at the summit.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.780 align:middle line:84%
But the monoliths of
the second semicircle,

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.076 align:middle line:84%
which are completely immersed,
are three to four times bigger.

00:35:58.076 --> 00:36:01.004 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:01.004 --> 00:36:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Archaeological excavations
made near the stones have given

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:12.800 align:middle line:84%
clues to the
function of the site.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the
archaeological material that

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:24.110 align:middle line:84%
has been found, there's over
a ton of pottery and traces

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.690 align:middle line:90%
of elements of fumigation.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.950 align:middle line:84%
So this could have links with
some kind of cult practice.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:35.150 align:middle line:90%


00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:39.320 align:middle line:84%
There were also a number
of little flint arrows

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and as well, there were
casings, and in these casings

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.620 align:middle line:90%
were the burned bones of cattle.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So we have something which
is perhaps a lot more

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
to do with the ceremony, cult
of some kind, but what kind,

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.900 align:middle line:90%
it's very hard to say.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing is sure is that
the semi-circles of stone were

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:01.480 align:middle line:84%
raised on dry land in a
very different landscape,

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
which has since been altered
by the change in climate.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.990 align:middle line:90%


00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Laurent has made a
photographic survey of the site

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to model it in 3D and simulate
the original environment.

00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:19.630 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years ago, it's
estimated the water level

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.810 align:middle line:90%
was six to eight meters lower.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:26.260 align:middle line:10%
>> It's true that imagining this
place without water requires

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.450 align:middle line:10%
a little effort of
the imagination.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.670 align:middle line:10%
So this image will help
that effort of imagination.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a model which
will help to understand

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.568 align:middle line:84%
the proportions of this to
the scale of the landscape.

00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:40.060 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> These standing stones were
without doubt part of a group

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:45.280 align:middle line:90%
of interconnected sites.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, far off, on the
other side of the sea,

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.750 align:middle line:84%
is a construction
of dry stones, which

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:51.130 align:middle line:90%
the archeologists call a cairn.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:56.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.740 align:middle line:84%
The Cairn of Gavrinis
is a funerary monument

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.320 align:middle line:90%
built around 4000 years BC.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.807 align:middle line:84%
Beneath this massive stone
is hidden a treasure,

00:38:04.807 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the sites
explored by Laurent Lescop.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.790 align:middle line:84%
22 of the 24 blocks
of stone which

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.100 align:middle line:84%
make up the inner corridor
and funeral chamber

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.320 align:middle line:84%
are entirely
covered in carvings.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:10%
The site is known for this
reason as the Neolithic Sistine

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Chapel.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.390 align:middle line:90%


00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Laurent is carefully
surveying all the stones

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to model them in 3D and thus,
be able to better decipher

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.220 align:middle line:90%
the motifs.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> We can see the carvings
much more precisely.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.760 align:middle line:84%
One very important
element is the position

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.820 align:middle line:84%
of each carving within
the global space.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.340 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, until now,
what we had been seeing

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.770 align:middle line:84%
were carvings
reproduced on a plan.

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So we had little idea
of the volume over which

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:90%
the carvings stretched.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.080 align:middle line:10%
However, Gavrinis by closely
observing all of the stones,

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.000 align:middle line:10%
we see that some
carvings are directed

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.570 align:middle line:10%
by the volume of the stones,
by the starting model

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.590 align:middle line:10%
that the stone offered.

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Given the density,
the regularity

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and the way in which
things have been done,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.240 align:middle line:84%
we can ask ourselves if
it was the same hand which

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.340 align:middle line:84%
carved the whole site,
and in that case,

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.905 align:middle line:84%
we would have ourselves here
a Michelangelo of that time.

00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the remarkable
elements is found here.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.440 align:middle line:90%
These are, in fact, boats.

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.900 align:middle line:90%
They are here and there.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And then these elements, like
points, would be the crew.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of representing
the boats and their crews that

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.370 align:middle line:84%
is found in a lot of
carvings of this time.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The maritime environment
certainly influenced

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.817 align:middle line:84%
the artistic repertory of
the Neolithic occupants

00:39:53.817 --> 00:39:54.617 align:middle line:90%
of the region.

00:39:54.617 --> 00:39:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> When you see the current,
you can see it makes arcs,

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:84%
and you could ask yourself if
these forms inspired what we

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:90%
find inside.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:13.810 align:middle line:90%


00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurent's objective is also
to make a precise 3D model

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:90%
of the exterior of the site.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.577 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.577 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Here, for example, we have
the general volume of the cairn

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:10%
as a scatter plot, and you can
see there are some elements

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:31.410 align:middle line:10%
missing, which will probably be
completed by the shots we take

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:10%
with the drone.

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
With the images
taken by the drone,

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll be able to have the
whole of the site all at once

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of detail, which will
then come in very, very useful.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, we'll take off.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Can we sweep the facade there?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:90%
We'll go from left to right.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:10.140 align:middle line:90%
>> There, that's perfect

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The use of models for the
exterior is to get the complete

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.460 align:middle line:84%
volume and the interior to have
detail of all the carvings,

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.810 align:middle line:84%
to relate the inside
to the outside,

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.180 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to place the
corridor very precisely

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.530 align:middle line:84%
in the cairn and have an image,
a bit like an ultrasound image.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Laurent thinks that
the corridor of the Cairn

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
of Gavrinis was lined up in
relation to the axis of the sun

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:36.170 align:middle line:90%
at the winter solstice.

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.160 align:middle line:84%
On the 21st of December,
the first rays of the sun

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:47.680 align:middle line:84%
light up the corridor
in the funeral chamber,

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.660 align:middle line:84%
one more sign that
shows the close link

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.490 align:middle line:84%
for Neolithic people
between nature

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and all the forces
that drive it.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:42:02.820 align:middle line:90%


00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Natural elements, whether
they be stone, water, wind,

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or the stars have contributed to
the placing of these megaliths.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.380 align:middle line:84%
>> This proximity between
standing stones and natural

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.105 align:middle line:84%
forces has helped to feed many
beliefs and legends throughout

00:42:18.105 --> 00:42:18.905 align:middle line:90%
the ages.

00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.660 align:middle line:10%
>> There are several legends
linked to the Giant Gargantua,

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.750 align:middle line:10%
to the fairies, to the
Corrigans, or Brittany elves.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:31.610 align:middle line:10%
For example, the
Giant Gargantua,

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:10%
who often had a pebble in
his shoes, pulled it out,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and when it fell
it became a menhir.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it's said that the spindle
of a fairy spinning wheel

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:44.170 align:middle line:90%
was turned into a menhir.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Or that the dolmen were the
houses of the Corrigans,

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:84%
those mischief elves,
that once night fell

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
could lead you into
infernal dances,

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and you'd never be seen again.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.330 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Very close to
megalithic monuments

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.340 align:middle line:84%
are often found natural
outcrops of rock

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:84%
on the surface
formed geologically

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.620 align:middle line:90%
by natural erosion of granite.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And these rocks,
which were often

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
thought to be
sacrificial stones,

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.670 align:middle line:90%
have led to many legends.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Some menhirs were used
for fertility rights

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:26.540 align:middle line:90%
for women wanting children.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Small flowers braided with oil
were brought to the menhir,

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:10%
and they rub their stomachs
against the menhir,

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.420 align:middle line:10%
naked preferably, and I've seen
this done, not by new agers

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.200 align:middle line:10%
but by older folk.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
So it hasn't yet disappeared
from tradition here.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It brings us back again to the
idea of a force in the stone.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:44.840 align:middle line:84%
When you see a
standing stone, I don't

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.240 align:middle line:84%
want to be a total
Freudian, and I'm not one,

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.250 align:middle line:84%
but there is a phallic
quality all the same

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:51.030 align:middle line:84%
in these enormous
standing stones,

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.150 align:middle line:84%
a force in this shape
of virility and potency.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays, a lot of people
come to find energy

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.820 align:middle line:84%
in these megaliths, come
and place the hands upon it

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:11.590 align:middle line:84%
or to walk around it, lie
down, sit, lie and watch them.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Do these stones transmit energy?

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're flirting with what
can be scientifically proved

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.566 align:middle line:84%
and that which can't be between
the visible and the invisible.

00:44:21.566 --> 00:44:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It is this invisible
part that Maria Wheatley is

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.760 align:middle line:90%
exploring.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Daughter of a dowser, she
quickly became interested

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.512 align:middle line:90%
in the energy of megaliths.

00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Her favorite exploration
ground is the site of Avebury

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:45.880 align:middle line:84%
where anybody fascinated
by menhir should visit.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a special area because
it contains Earth energy,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.220 align:middle line:10%
and that's what our ancient
ancestors were looking for.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.740 align:middle line:84%
This is a ley line,
called the Saint Michael

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
line that's 300 miles
coursing across the landscape.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:84%
You get many ceremonial
centers lined upon this ley.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.470 align:middle line:84%
Avebury is at the exact
center of this line.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria thinks Avebury's
site is deliberate.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The site is in the middle
of a flow of energy

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
that crosses the southern United
Kingdom from west to east.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When you root a standing
stone into the ground

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:84%
on an Earth current, something
truly magical begins to happen.

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.360 align:middle line:84%
The stone absorbs
the Earth energy,

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:31.270 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of has
these energy bands

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.760 align:middle line:90%
that coil around the stone.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.790 align:middle line:84%
There's five above
ground and two below.

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Band number two sends an
electromagnetic signal

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.970 align:middle line:84%
to that stone, to that stone,
to that stone, to that stone.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a spider's web
of electromagnetic energy

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:49.960 align:middle line:90%
on the inside of a stone circle.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.900 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:52.900 --> 00:46:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Maria,
the capacity of the stones

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:15.060 align:middle line:84%
to absorb energy comes
from their composition.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> This type of stone
is a form of sandstone.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Sandstone formed
thousands of years ago.

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.655 align:middle line:84%
And it contains
a lot of silicon,

00:46:23.655 --> 00:46:25.280 align:middle line:84%
which is quite
intriguing, because when

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
we think of silicon, we think
of macrochips and microchips

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and everything that has
revolutionized our lives,

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:35.360 align:middle line:84%
because semiconductors
and those microchips

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:84%
are used today in our
PCs, our telephones.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, our ancient ancestors
may have used them

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.100 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different
way, because this

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.330 align:middle line:84%
is a massive piece of silicon
put into Earth energy currents

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to make them come alive
with those energy bands.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you a
dowsing demonstration now.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.710 align:middle line:90%
This is a dowsing rod.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It's made of copper and nickel.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite conductive.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:01.040 align:middle line:84%
It's particularly good at
picking up these energy bands.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:84%
So just by lifting the rod
up the face of the stone,

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:84%
when it gets to the top of that
third energy band, there we go.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.670 align:middle line:90%
There, it said found.

00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's the top there.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.630 align:middle line:84%
We just lift it up the
face of the stone again.

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.000 align:middle line:84%
That's particularly
strong there.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And lift it up the face
of the stone there,

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.035 align:middle line:90%
that's the energy band.

00:47:21.035 --> 00:47:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people think the
Neolithic people knew how

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.800 align:middle line:90%
to channel this energy.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:90%


00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people think somehow
our ancient ancestors were able

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate that energy
and transport stones.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.880 align:middle line:90%
That sounds quite fantastic.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.160 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there's a shred
of evidence for that.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.320 align:middle line:84%
With using our
equipment, we decided

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.680 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was any
electromagnetic activity

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.780 align:middle line:84%
happening in the Earth
currents, and what

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.690 align:middle line:84%
we found was three distinctive
electromagnetic signals.

00:47:56.690 --> 00:48:01.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a researcher who looks
into the Bosnian pyramids,

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and he claims that the signal
for levitation is 25 Hertz.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, we found round about 25
Hertz in this Earth current.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.500 align:middle line:84%
So could it be that our
ancient ancestors somehow knew

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and manipulated that
frequency of levitation?

00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria also thinks she has
unlocked the secret of why

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the megalithic sites have
such an attraction for us.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> With our equipment, we
realized that the Earth

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:47.130 align:middle line:84%
currents and underground water,
particular type of underground

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:51.570 align:middle line:84%
water, emits a frequency, and
that frequency is seven Hertz.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.827 align:middle line:84%
Seven Hertz is when
you feel relaxed.

00:48:55.827 --> 00:48:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you're
in a meditative state.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure that is why people
are drawn to these sites.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:03.150 align:middle line:84%
They know what's good
for them, and they

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.460 align:middle line:84%
feel that there's something
about these sites.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.600 align:middle line:90%
They make them feel good.

>> The energy released by these
sites attracts us even today,

00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:20.880 align:middle line:84%
although, according to Maria,
our ancestors could feel it

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:90%
much more powerfully.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Our ancestors were more
connected to the landscape,

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and also, I think their
sensitivity was increased.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Today, we just walk around.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.030 align:middle line:84%
We've got synthetic
clothes on, made of nylon.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Some of us wear synthetic shoes.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.750 align:middle line:84%
We're not connected
to the earth,

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:90%
so we've lost that connection.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I feel ancient
sites, they're places

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.980 align:middle line:84%
where we can get a connection
back to Mother Earth.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's about really
connecting back to the Earth

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:49.241 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the Earth
in all of her glory.

00:49:49.241 --> 00:49:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Megaliths attract us through
their evocative power for they

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.720 align:middle line:84%
draw us back to the
origins of our culture.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.470 align:middle line:90%


00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.730 align:middle line:84%
They illustrate an essential
period of humanity's history

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:11.110 align:middle line:84%
6,000 years ago, when our
ancestors settled, marked out

00:50:11.110 --> 00:50:13.870 align:middle line:84%
their territory,
buried their dead,

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and set the foundations
of a civilization which

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.145 align:middle line:84%
the megaliths symbolized
spectacularly.

00:50:19.145 --> 00:50:24.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.280 align:middle line:84%
While science has allowed
us to better understand

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.100 align:middle line:84%
who built these monuments,
at what time they were built,

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and how, a question has
never been answered.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:37.110 align:middle line:84%
For our ancestors took with
them the rituals and beliefs

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.000 align:middle line:84%
that brought these
places to life.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.750 align:middle line:90%
