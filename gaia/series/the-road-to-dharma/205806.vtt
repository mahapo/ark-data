00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, shit, shit,
shit, and saying it out loud.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Like, slow down.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm not comfortable with this.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
freak him out as well.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Like, I understand
the energy exchange.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:39.428 align:middle line:84%
But it was very hard for me
to chill out and be at peace

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
with gliding down the
mountain and not knowing

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.440 align:middle line:90%
where the gas station is.

00:09:18.653 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.188 align:middle line:10%
I guess we go up here.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:90%

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:90%

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%

the map two days ago.

>> Everyone seems
in good spirits.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Despite Ken running out of
gas and Tiffany's fears,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.210 align:middle line:90%
he had the ride of his life.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And we simply siphoned
gas from my bike to his.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Elle is riding well, and
even carries her mechanic

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%
on the back of her bike.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And Fred continues
to push onward

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:90%

As we arrived in town, I
had the rare opportunity

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.550 align:middle line:84%
to finally challenge
the locals to a race.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.922 align:middle line:84%
It's not often that I have the
chance to be the fastest rider.

[EXCITED TALKING]

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:10%
From here at the town of
Govind Ghat at 6,000 feet,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:10%
we'll embark on a
13-kilometer trek

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:30.580 align:middle line:10%
to the base camp of Hemkund
Sahib at 11,400 feet.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
From here, we can go to the
Hidden Valley of the Flowers,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:84%
or we can take the nearly
4,000-foot vertical hike

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.658 align:middle line:84%
to the temple in Glacier
Lake at 15,200 feet.

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:44.075 align:middle line:84%
For this part of
the hike, the key

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.550 align:middle line:84%
is to get up there
before nightfall,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
so some of the riders
decide to take mules

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:90%
instead of hoofing it on foot.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear, riding the mules
isn't as easy or safe as one

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:90%
might think.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Mark takes an early fall,
his size way too much

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:90%
to handle for this mule.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And Elle, her mule bucks her
off as well after her guide

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.146 align:middle line:84%
persisted in hitting
the mule to go faster.

00:12:20.146 --> 00:12:21.505 align:middle line:90%
>> He bucked me off.

00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Up, up.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.725 align:middle line:84%
>> He was kicking it,
banging it, yanking it.

00:12:26.725 --> 00:12:30.685 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- it
just retaliated.

00:12:30.685 --> 00:12:31.590 align:middle line:90%
But now it's cool.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.535 align:middle line:90%
Got back on it.

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Gave it love.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
And I told the--

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.430 align:middle line:84%
him if he hit it again,
I was going to hit him.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:90%

these are massive mountains.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.640 align:middle line:10%
We are in a little valley,
surrounded by high Himalayas.

11,000 feet.

00:13:37.435 --> 00:13:38.380 align:middle line:10%
We are at 11,000 feet.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Just walking.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:10%
No access road, nothing.

all of this stuff?

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:44.490 align:middle line:10%

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.605 align:middle line:10%
>> Must have taken a long time.

00:13:46.605 --> 00:13:49.760 align:middle line:10%

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:10%

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.360 align:middle line:10%
Four stories.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.350 align:middle line:10%
Look at this structure.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:10%
All by hand.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people have to hit
rock bottom to figure out what

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:90%
has to change.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.990 align:middle line:90%
I was one of those people.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It happened to me.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:10%
You know, we all go
through those black periods

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:10%
in our life.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.280 align:middle line:10%
And at one point
in my life, someone

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:10%
has taken that
strength away from me.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Really made me afraid
of confrontation,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and just as much because my
anger is not always bridled,

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.860 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say nasty things right
off the top of my mind.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Works that way.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's quick and it's not
always the best thing to say,

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:90%
but it's what comes out of me.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So what I've
trained myself to do

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
or what I've been trained
to do over the last however

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
many years is to just sit and
be quiet, and take it and just

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
wad it off in that little
ball and just deal with it.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It's easier than having the
confrontation, you know?

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Tomorrow, we'll make the
nearly 5,000-foot vertical hike

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
to our last sacred
peak, Hemkund Sahib,

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:84%
the important Sikh
temple in Glacier Lake.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
But today, we journey
into the mountains,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
to the Hidden Valley

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you have all
that freedom here that you

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
don't have at home, that
you've got to be the dad

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to step
up and lay down the rules

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%
for the kids.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:90%
I was talking to Anand once.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:10%
I talked to him about
some of the problems

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:10%
I have with my 12-year-old,
and that he could get violent

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:10%
with me.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:90%
He's pushed me.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.483 align:middle line:84%
And Anand's first question
was, what does his dad do?

00:16:29.483 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
That's always somebody's
first question,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:90%
is, what does the dad do?

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of have
to say, I don't know.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hoping that
that's something that Anand

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:90%
would talk to Jeff about.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
That could be a
man-to-man discussion

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:84%
those two could have that
I think would really help,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.120 align:middle line:84%
because Jeff thinks he's,
like, in the middle,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:84%
between me and Draven,
when actually he

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:90%
needs to be with me.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.110 align:middle line:90%
We have to be on the same team.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:18.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So today, I had
an ass kicking day,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.760 align:middle line:90%
spiritually and emotionally.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:84%
So kind of it all started
out with the whole breakfast

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.480 align:middle line:84%
scenario as people
are bitching, you

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:36.470 align:middle line:84%
know, because we had
basically naan for breakfast.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm the type of person
that when I exercise,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.070 align:middle line:90%
I make sure I have protein.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I have fruit or whatever.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And this morning we just had
what was essentially bread.

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I wasn't
happy about that.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I have eaten out of
trash cans, you know?

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
So I don't need the middle
to upper class experience

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
where I show gratitude through
only having this little bit,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and then I go back to my life.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I know what it is like
to have nothing to eat.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And that just was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And I said, look.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm rich.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted to, I could leave,
and I can eat filet mignon

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
right now at 8 o'clock
in the morning,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
so don't talk to me about
fake middle class gratitude.

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.855 align:middle line:84%
And that I think was
the moment, you know?

00:18:17.855 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
All of the minor irritations
culminated into that one little

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:90%
smack comment, you know?

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was silence at the table.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
my angriest moment.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, everything that I've
experienced just all--

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
from life just all came
crashing into my response

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.360 align:middle line:90%
to that comment.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.492 align:middle line:84%
>> In relating that story
to Anand on the way up

00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Valley of
the Flowers today,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:84%
I told him I just kind of
more or less wanted to get up

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:90%
and leave.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And he turned on
me, and not mad,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
but in that unique
kind of Anand way.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a scolding
way, you know?

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.240 align:middle line:84%
He said to me,
you're a nice guy,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
but you don't always have
to be a fucking nice guy.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.807 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your intention
for the journey?

00:19:09.807 --> 00:19:11.140 align:middle line:90%
What was your intention to come?

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
What did you put in
the fire last night?

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I want peace.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Peace for myself and
the people I love.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And why do you think
you may lack full peace?

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I never feel it.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you don't
accept your power.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of
you you're denying,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.340 align:middle line:90%
suppressing, afraid of it.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I am afraid of it.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Until you don't accept that,
till you don't embrace that,

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.875 align:middle line:90%
you won't experience peace.

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And this journey for
you is about that.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.430 align:middle line:84%
You know, people at
home were more excited

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
about this than me, because
I've been afraid of this.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
You're afraid of who you
are, the truth of who

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:84%
you are, because you
know that's powerful.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And you think you won't
be able to handle it.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.177 align:middle line:84%
>> You think that you need
to prove yourself to know

00:20:15.177 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:90%
that's who you are.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:90%
You need to accept that.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.650 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to become that.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's why you are afraid.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.395 align:middle line:84%
You think you can't
become it, that it's

00:20:21.395 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:90%
a becoming, that you will fail.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a becoming.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It's you getting out of
your way, you accepting it.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Not believing those
toxic thoughts

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that float around in your mind
of self-denial, of insecurity,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
or fear of failure.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I also fear hurting people.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And you can't.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.010 align:middle line:84%
That's just a defense mechanism,
because you are afraid to fail.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:50.480 align:middle line:90%
So then a thought comes.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't do that
because I'm afraid to.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:53.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of hurting people.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:90%
It's attached to that fear.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's convenient for me to
just remain in my comfort zone.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
The magic always happens outside
of your comfort zone, Ryan.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:90%
That's where peace lies.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Not in the box.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:19.232 align:middle line:84%
It's just a convenient
thought attached to that fear.

00:21:19.232 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to, because I
don't want to hurt people.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
By being in that space,
you are hurting people,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
because you're letting them
continue in the toxicity.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:34.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:90%
In your presence.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
This morning, when they were
going into their toxicity--

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
oh, my husband is so rich, I
can bring a helicopter here.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Somebody dare say
that in my presence.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.670 align:middle line:90%
That's why they all sneak out.

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
If they have the courage,
let them say it around me.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Why would they not say
that in front of me?

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.335 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:21:58.335 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you'd tell them.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.667 align:middle line:90%
But they need validation.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:84%
That's why they're
speaking in front of you,

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.510 align:middle line:90%
so that they can feel validated.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And then these toxic
thoughts are validated.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> They become real
to their people.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.933 align:middle line:84%
They become part of
their personality.

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:18.440 align:middle line:84%
They become part
of their nature.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they
throw it everywhere

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
they go, even in a
magnificent space like this.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about,
my husband is so rich,

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.863 align:middle line:84%
he can send a helicopter to
pick me up and I can go eat.

00:22:30.863 --> 00:22:32.738 align:middle line:84%
These people are animals
who are eating here.

00:22:32.738 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So there, you're hurting.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.358 align:middle line:90%
>> You're hurting the planet.

00:22:41.358 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
You're hurting the
soul of the planet.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.122 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.122 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why our
world doesn't change

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.048 align:middle line:84%
with so many wonderful,
good people like you.

00:22:52.048 --> 00:22:54.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:54.092 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you need
to accept your power.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Take this time to
really-- once we stop,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.740 align:middle line:90%
you need to speak up.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:13.570 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> We are approaching towards
the end of the journey, yeah?

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.007 align:middle line:90%
So-- at least up here.

00:23:40.007 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Then we'll be in Rishikesh
for three or four days.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.610 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
integration [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's important for you to be
aware of your intention, yeah?

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And to be aware that you
are not on a visit to India

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:84%
to Golden Triangle,
organized by a tour operator.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:90%
Let just that be clear.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the trip you all came on.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.800 align:middle line:90%
This is a journey for learning.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a journey for expanding.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey
for transcendence.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.640 align:middle line:90%
Be aware of that.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
I have a very young body,
which likes to eat also.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm eating the
same thing you are.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.750 align:middle line:90%
So grow up.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
We are on a spiritual journey,
and I want spirituality

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.240 align:middle line:84%
only till it comes in
package, in the box I want.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not Costco.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We are not at Costco
or Barneys or Nordstrom

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.150 align:middle line:90%
or any shopping mall, all right?

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We are on a journey
of transformation.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Every little opportunity
I'll take to test you.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.540 align:middle line:84%
We'll do the teaching, and then
within the next hour or two,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
you will get the opportunity
to practice the teaching.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we can sit and all we
can do is I can keep teaching.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And we can keep
reading from scriptures

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.690 align:middle line:84%
and I can talk about
transcendental reality and all

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.490 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And you say, wow.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.453 align:middle line:90%
And then what alters?

00:25:26.453 --> 00:25:27.370 align:middle line:90%
We are still the same.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Just new vocabulary.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:90%
New information in the mind.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Nothing within us has altered.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:35.380 align:middle line:90%
We are the same people.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Magic will only happen
outside of your comfort zone.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:90%


00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Somebody said to me,
oh, I was expecting

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.030 align:middle line:90%
we would do more yoga.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.030 align:middle line:90%
This is yoga.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
Yoga is [NON-ENGLISH].

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:90%
The sensation of self is yoga.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
The transcendence
of self is yoga,

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.830 align:middle line:84%
towards transcendence of
the mind, its reactions,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.955 align:middle line:84%
its calculations, its
agendas, its expectations.

00:26:04.955 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:84%
The conditioned self,
the transcendence

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioned self
is the beginning of yoga.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Not the stretching.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:90%
That's just called stretching.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.445 align:middle line:90%
Don't call it yoga.

00:26:15.445 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Call it stretching.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Some will be triggered
by something.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:90%
Some others will be triggered.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Not one thing will
trigger everybody, right?

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:90%
None of it is personal.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But these are
opportunities to practice,

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
to really look at self,
that at, how does self

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.700 align:middle line:90%
react at these moments?

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
This is not a journey to feel
better, do you understand?

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.450 align:middle line:90%
You come here to transcend.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We come here to expand,
not just to put Band-Aids.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:03.110 align:middle line:90%
We come here to go deeper.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we test.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.260 align:middle line:90%
What if our attention is taken?

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:90%
What takes our attention?

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.192 align:middle line:84%
When we get up, as we
sit around the table,

00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
what do we talk
about in those gaps?

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:90%
What are our conversations?

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
What are we giving
our attention to?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:31.245 align:middle line:90%
Gossiping, cribbing, grouping.

00:27:31.245 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.520 align:middle line:84%
It's life at play,
right here, right now.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
we get to practice,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.558 align:middle line:90%
because there is no escaping.

00:27:41.558 --> 00:27:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
We can think about it, but
all of us here, none of us

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is that weak to
escape, to run away.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.310 align:middle line:90%
We are all here, very strong.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.840 align:middle line:90%
And none of it is personal.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking to a
personal individual.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.510 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about states of
consciousness, states of mind,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.040 align:middle line:90%
states of unconscious mind.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we are in
a group, when we

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:84%
are in a collective
village like this,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:20.070 align:middle line:84%
it's our dharma,
our duty, to not

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:84%
engage in the downward
progression of somebody.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Sympathy is not compassion.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Sympathy just adds
to the pain body.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Pity and sympathy are a
degradation of human spirit.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:84%
When you pity somebody,
you degrade them.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:90%
You take away their dignity.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.530 align:middle line:84%
When you sympathize,
you join their misery.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.810 align:middle line:90%
It expands.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most
humanity hovers around.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.350 align:middle line:90%
Pity and sympathy?

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:90%
Because so that we can belong.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Compassion might not seem
sometimes gentle or kind.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.340 align:middle line:90%
It goes much deeper.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it will express
itself as fire, very abrupt.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's our duty when
we are in a group

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and in a journey
like this to be aware

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.780 align:middle line:90%
that we are here to evolve.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody is
stuck in an altered

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:30.300 align:middle line:84%
or a downward progression
of consciousness,

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.945 align:middle line:84%
that you serve that individual,
that we serve that individual.

00:29:33.945 --> 00:29:34.820 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear me, Ryan?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.630 align:middle line:84%
To help or serve
that person who is

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
stuck in that state
of consciousness

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to come out of it,
because that's what

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
we are here all together for.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear me?

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, three people
here or two people there,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and then they're talking
about those people there.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And energetically,
you can sense it.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.408 align:middle line:90%
What, do you think I'm blind?

00:30:01.408 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I can do this with my
eyes closed and ears shut.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:22.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And when we're so clearly
seeing our egos' conditioning

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
exposed, will our group of
Ryan, Jeff, Elle, all of us,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:34.080 align:middle line:84%
will we move to
protect and fear,

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.200 align:middle line:84%
or will we expand
and find freedom?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:42.290 align:middle line:90%


00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> So it is our duty.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.680 align:middle line:90%
It is our dharma.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.410 align:middle line:84%
It's our responsibility
not only to ourselves,

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.140 align:middle line:90%
but each and every one.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Don't underestimate
how deeply you

00:30:53.690 --> 00:31:00.650 align:middle line:84%
can impact everybody's journey
just by the way you are being.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:90%

them?

then I go back to the chant.

00:32:05.573 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:10%

walk with purpose.
