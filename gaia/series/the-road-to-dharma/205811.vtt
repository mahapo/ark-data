illusion in their mind

that they are free
while they walk around

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:84%
enslaved by their own
small self waiting

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
to take up arms and
ammunition against self

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.600 align:middle line:90%
and against each other.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So the opportunity
of us coming together

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
in such sincere intention is to
set ourselves free from self.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we are the ones who
are in our way every moment,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle line:90%
not the experience.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the experience
that is in the way.

And when you begin to
really access the true self,

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
then you are purely
experiencing, purely,

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:90%

All conflict ends.

Be very aware of what you give
your attention to in your mind

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and what you give life
to through your words.

Otherwise, there'll be no peace.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:84%
We'll be trying to
feed off each other.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.410 align:middle line:90%
You hear me?

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%

And I think when I allow
myself to focus on petty,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
you know, unimportant things,
that same power can really

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.550 align:middle line:84%
pierce people in a way that
I'm not really too proud of,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and kind of hurt people.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not proud of that.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
For him to say, you know,
you can affect people deeply,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
it's like, OK, well, where
do you want to go with that?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.180 align:middle line:84%
How deep do I want to pierce
them and inspire them?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Or do I want to hurt them and
leave casualties along the way?

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.590 align:middle line:90%

to try to come out, come home
to that from a place of love.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Like if they're being
violent towards me

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and violent towards one
another with their words

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.540 align:middle line:84%
or with their actions, if
I react to that with love,

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.990 align:middle line:90%
how could they be violent back?

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:90%

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.270 align:middle line:10%

not returning with the group

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:90%
to Rishikesh where we started.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Going back to Rishikesh is an
important part of integration.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But Mario often gets pulled
off onto side adventures.

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Valley
of the Flowers,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:84%
he wandered off and missed
Anand's very important talk.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I have lots of energy.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I put the energy out.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:90%
I get lots of energy.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes I don't know
exactly what to do

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:10%
or how to focus it in
it and it burns up.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:90%
And I can start a lot of things.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go
into Nepal, Tibet,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:90%
we were right on the borders.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
It made sense.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's so much
beautiful things

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
right here in this part
of India in the Himalayas,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
that I got to respect
what this has to give me.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.990 align:middle line:84%
So that was something
Anand said, hey,

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
stay focused, complete
your cycles, finish it

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:90%
and things will be all right.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going through sort
of a life change right now,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:10%
so it's not necessarily a fear.

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Maybe some sort of an
ego, self-centeredness.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of factors
playing in my life right now.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And you know, while you're
trekking and hiking up

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:84%
in the Himalayas and you do
get to spend a lot of time

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.000 align:middle line:84%
while you're
walking, you can walk

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
with people and talk
and chat, but you also

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.087 align:middle line:84%
spend a lot of time by
yourself to contemplate.

00:12:27.087 --> 00:12:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what a
lot of people are doing,

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
myself included.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Contemplating on really what
is my next step and where

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
do I want to go.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think being up in a
place like the Himalayas

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:90%
kind of brings clarity.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.246 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.246 --> 00:12:53.675 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) The river is
flowing, flowing and rolling.

00:12:53.675 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:10%
The river.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:10%
>> As a man, I think in the
world we live in, there's a lot

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:10%
of pressure on men socially.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:10%
So it's important for men to
first come into their power

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:10%
and not seek the who
am I through money.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:17.685 align:middle line:10%
Men have a deep insecurity
around money and sexuality.

00:13:17.685 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:10%
Do you understand?

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:10%
Sex, money, fame, power.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:10%
But money more so,
because money means power.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:10%
Power to provide,
power to take care.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:10%
Money means attention,
it's a self-worth thing,

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.180 align:middle line:10%
do you understand?

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:10%
So, we give a lot
of meaning to money.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:10%
So it's very important
for a man to first

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:10%
really set himself free and
know himself independently

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:10%
of the money, of his self-worth,
what he is really made of.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.296 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely, absolute certainty.

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:10%
Feel very certain in it.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.020 align:middle line:10%
And then one has to stop
looking at money as money.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:57.905 align:middle line:10%
That's an art.

00:13:57.905 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:10%
Until you stop looking
at money as money,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:10%
you will always be poor.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.980 align:middle line:10%
No matter how much you
have, you will always

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.093 align:middle line:10%
have issues with it.

00:14:06.093 --> 00:14:08.510 align:middle line:10%
So even when you think about
your career, you don't think,

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:10%
how will I make money?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:10%
You think about how am I
going to support people?

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.880 align:middle line:10%
How am i going to help people?

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:10%
How am I going to
make people feel?

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.158 align:middle line:10%
What am I going to
create, which is going

00:14:16.158 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:10%
to create something of value?

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:10%
Something which is
going to touch people.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:10%
And the money starts to flow.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.472 align:middle line:10%
The moment you start
thinking on the money level,

00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:27.430 align:middle line:10%
you have given up your power.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:10%
You succumb to a
man made entity.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> When speaking about
money and prosperity,

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Anand went on to tell us
about his father who came

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to Rishikesh where Anand was
born over 40 years ago with

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
just $0.25 to his name.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.190 align:middle line:84%
This is before the
Beatles ever came there,

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.570 align:middle line:90%
before it was on the global map.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Just a small jungle town where
his father built up photography

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.270 align:middle line:90%
to a jewelry business.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But it was this business
and his life's work

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:90%
that he almost lost.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.337 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:02.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And you know, so I was
telling this story about

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.220 align:middle line:10%
my father.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.250 align:middle line:10%
So he once got an order,
I think this was about,

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.970 align:middle line:10%
more than a decade
ago, I was very young.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:10%
And the biggest
order of his life,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.183 align:middle line:10%
once he had started
the jewelry design,

00:15:14.183 --> 00:15:18.800 align:middle line:10%
jewelry business for a few
thousand dollars, you know.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:10%
It was big money for that time.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.977 align:middle line:10%
Around $50,00, $60,000,
something, you know.

00:15:25.977 --> 00:15:27.060 align:middle line:10%
And then he would sell it.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:10%
So it was a lot of money
at that time in India.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:10%
And in a small village
like Lakshman Jhula.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.297 align:middle line:10%
So he went and bought
this big order,

00:15:36.297 --> 00:15:37.880 align:middle line:10%
he bought all the
gems and everything.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.088 align:middle line:10%
He found the best gems and
everything, massive amount

00:15:40.088 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:10%
of emeralds.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:10%
He had the buyer ready who
was going to pay for it.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.106 align:middle line:10%
Who was going to buy.

00:15:47.106 --> 00:15:50.760 align:middle line:10%
He was coming back from
where he bought it,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.982 align:middle line:10%
he stopped at a temple.

00:15:52.982 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:10%
A Goddess, Divine Mother temple.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:10%
He had, you know in
jewelry business,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.290 align:middle line:10%
gems are small things, this can
be millions of dollars, rights?

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.570 align:middle line:10%
So he went into the
temple, he came out,

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.437 align:middle line:10%
he had the bag on
him, everything gone.

00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:11.060 align:middle line:10%


00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.896 align:middle line:10%
From inside the temple.

00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:16.220 align:middle line:10%
All of it, gone.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:10%
So whatever he had built till
that time was gone in a moment.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.760 align:middle line:10%
I remember him coming
back from there.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.295 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, you know, my mom,
they were sitting there.

00:16:28.295 --> 00:16:30.023 align:middle line:10%
So she asked him,
how was the trip?

00:16:30.023 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:10%
He said, yeah, it was great.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:10%
I loved the journey.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.965 align:middle line:10%
I went to these places, I got
the best gems and everything

00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and then I sat in
the taxi cab and I

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:10%
went to the beautiful temple.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:10%
Oh, yeah, and then at the
temple, I lost my stuff.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.593 align:middle line:10%
So that was not the
first thing he told her.

00:16:45.593 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:10%
And he said, you know,
I remember still,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.700 align:middle line:10%
he said very clearly, he said,
you know when it came to me,

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:10%
I was very happy.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:10%
When it's taken from me
why should I be unhappy?

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.060 align:middle line:10%
It was never mine to begin with.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.405 align:middle line:10%
If I need it, I'll get it.

00:17:03.405 --> 00:17:07.279 align:middle line:10%
And if I don't, I'll
get something else.

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:10%
I will get whatever I need,
I have no doubt about it.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:10%
And his business grew
exponentially after that.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.588 align:middle line:10%
He started from scratch again.

00:17:16.588 --> 00:17:18.130 align:middle line:10%
And I think he did
a pretty good job,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:10%
and never compromised
on principles.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.462 align:middle line:10%
So never.

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:10%
I've never seen him compromise
on principles, very clearly.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Now, it
shall, it shall be.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:45.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Today we hike up to the last
sacred peak, Hemkund Sahib.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:51.180 align:middle line:84%
We start at 11,400 feet and go
to 15,000 feet of elevation.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:54.180 align:middle line:84%
It's nearly a vertical
hike, and the oxygen levels

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
make it harder and
harder to breathe.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.520 align:middle line:10%
>> When we went up to the
Valley of the Flowers,

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:10%
just felt really cleansed
and really refreshed.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And it's kind of funny, because
I really resisted doing it.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Do I really want to
go to the Sikh temple?

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure and everybody
kept amplifying

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that it was going to be
harder than Kedarnath,

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and I was like, well, I
don't want to do that.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.384 align:middle line:84%
I don't feel like
I'm in that space.

00:18:23.384 --> 00:18:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING)
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Early on in the hike, Jen
is having a lot of difficulties

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:84%
with the altitude and the
lack of oxygen. Jeff, however,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
is being more
helpful than before.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.440 align:middle line:84%
He seems continually
inspired by Anand's wisdom.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So much so, that he starts
making his own inquiries

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.830 align:middle line:84%
into the nature of his
ego, and perhaps his

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and human nature's
propensity for violence.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Being a million, the
population came down to two

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:18.975 align:middle line:84%
or three million of just me and
some women that had the same

00:19:18.975 --> 00:19:19.775 align:middle line:90%
ideas.

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
I suppose there would
be years of peace.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But then eventually, I'm
sure the ego would come out,

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:35.530 align:middle line:84%
the individual needs would come
out, and we would go to battle,

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.692 align:middle line:84%
even though we look the
same, we believe the same,

00:19:38.692 --> 00:19:40.808 align:middle line:90%
we want the same, I suppose.

00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:90%
We would still end up fighting.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere in human nature
it's that ego, I guess,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
that leads to destruction.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So maybe here I can do
something about me personally.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the reality is, I've
got a pretty good cold right

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:10%
now and we basically reached
the climax of our physical

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:10%
challenge today, going up
our most challenging hike.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But I was absolutely going
to persist through it

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of hiking up
it and hiking down it,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
despite my sickness.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say being in this
environment definitely assists

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
in a mindset, if
you will, that there

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
are some techniques,
some processes,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.900 align:middle line:84%
some mindsets that
can help you persevere

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.990 align:middle line:84%
through those challenges,
despite the illness,

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and to conquer them.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, those are very
valuable kinds of tools for us

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
to have that we carry with
us beyond this journey too,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.120 align:middle line:90%
in all walks of our life.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> En route to Hemkund Sahib,
the mantra that Anand gave us,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and that many of the Sikhs
around us are chanting,

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:90%
is waheguru.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.322 align:middle line:84%
Waheguru is a celebration of the
guru within, the power within.

00:21:17.322 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:90%
[CHIMING]

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Waheguru, the guru
inside, the warrior inside.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:29.383 align:middle line:10%
Waheguru has taught me for
so long and brought me here.

00:21:29.383 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Waheguru inside
and all the people

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:90%
that have chosen to be here.

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I think the wise guru inside
has all made the choice,

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.908 align:middle line:84%
and then the mind has just
caught up this whole trip.

00:21:37.908 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:90%
We're halfway through the hike.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING)
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Start going up the
mountain and I felt so easy,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
like I was just kind
of gliding through.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:08.885 align:middle line:84%
And all I had in my head was
the Sikh chant, Satnam Waheguru.

00:22:08.885 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept saying
it over and over,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and then I'd have a
voice interject saying,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:90%
walk with purpose.

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go
back to the chant.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.067 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like,
walk with purpose.

00:22:21.067 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You know, I stopped to look at
the view at the midway camp.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Some of the Sikhs were
like, come have chai.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Another one was saying, come
on, come with me, come on.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It was just very
inviting and very easy.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And it just didn't faze me.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And we'd literally climb
the whole mountain with them

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
chanting nonstop around us.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And their singing
just kind of, it

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:90%
was like we're almost floating.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, the tone, and it
was just the same mantra

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:00.690 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, and
whatever they were saying

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:90%
was the strongest sound current.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And it felt that way.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So even though it
was the hardest,

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.920 align:middle line:84%
it felt like it was the easiest,
because we were actually

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.910 align:middle line:84%
in the company of Sikhs,
of people who are really

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
taking a pilgrimage, because
it was the end of the season.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:90%
So it was fabulous.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:90%
My favorite one by far.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.505 align:middle line:84%
The temple, the
communion with the food.

00:23:23.505 --> 00:23:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:37.080 align:middle line:84%
It was just giant, giant pots,
like huge vats, metal of chai,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and then like a soup
that was like porridge

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.950 align:middle line:90%
and a curry soup mixed together.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was free.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting,
because it wasn't cooked

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:90%
in like the best environment.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:84%
It probably was
one of the, coming

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.740 align:middle line:84%
from an American standpoint,
one of the less hygienic places

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:90%
to cook food.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I think it was a garage.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't even think that was
like a kitchen, you know.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
But the love and
the fellowship just,

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.420 align:middle line:84%
it just made everything
more flavorful, you know,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:90%
it really did.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:22.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the place
which signifies that a life

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:90%
of purpose.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Purpose to evolve,
purpose to serve others.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.340 align:middle line:90%
Just not about me.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Which has been a big
teaching for these people.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Most of the challenges that
faced is when they have been,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and what about me?

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I don't like
this, oh, you know.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So this last journey
last week is service.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
A life of purpose,
a life of greater

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:84%
meaning than the little I.
What does their life stand for?

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:90%
What is your legacy?

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.230 align:middle line:84%
What are you adding
to the collective,

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.130 align:middle line:84%
to the unified field by the way
you be, by the way you live,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:84%
by the way you think,
what do you believe in?

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:84%
What are you willing
to surrender?

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:84%
What are you willing
to stand up for?

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think those are
important questions.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of time, we
lose this question

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and we are caught
up in petty things.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:90%
A life of purpose is important.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.965 align:middle line:90%


00:25:26.965 --> 00:25:28.840 align:middle line:10%
A free man is always a
warrior, but a warrior

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.170 align:middle line:10%
who stands up for principle,
stands up for life,

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:10%
for compassion, for service,
for life beyond little I,

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:10%
for light beyond, what about me.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:84%
To a warrior, power
is an authentic power.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Power which is nothing
over the other.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:90%
It is connection.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.660 align:middle line:84%
It is realizing that you are
the whole and the whole is you.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.790 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing more powerful
than that realization.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So a warrior walks free,
lives free, and serves.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Lives radically.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.940 align:middle line:84%
A warrior would never
be, the yogic warrior

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.508 align:middle line:84%
would not be contained
within the society's norms.

00:26:03.508 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And there will always
be a little bit

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:90%
of madness in the warrior.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Can't be too sane.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.390 align:middle line:84%
As Krishnamurti said,
to be well adjusted

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:18.480 align:middle line:84%
to a profoundly sick society
is no measure of health.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
So a warrior is living in
the world, but not of it.

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>> As we all gather here at
this frigid glacial lake,

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
we'll have the opportunity
to dip our little I,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
the individual I into the
frigid waters and connect with

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:42.020 align:middle line:84%
the unity, the power and
the source of these great

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:90%
mountains.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But when we talk
about masculine power,

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.820 align:middle line:84%
it is to stand up
for principles.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Not dogma or fanaticism,
but principles of evolution,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
principles are something
which are beyond the, what

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.020 align:middle line:90%
about me syndrome.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:90%
To stand up.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And also, absolutely
be ready to surrender,

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.666 align:middle line:90%
because that's powerful too.

00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:14.170 align:middle line:84%
To be ready to surrender
when it's needed, absolutely.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.059 align:middle line:90%
A strong spine and a soft heart.

00:27:16.059 --> 00:27:37.086 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.086 --> 00:27:39.261 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) I'm coming home.

00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:42.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm coming home.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm coming home
straight to my heart.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.787 align:middle line:10%
I'm coming home.

00:27:45.787 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:10%
>> I saw him go under a couple
of times and I was really

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.310 align:middle line:10%
starting to panic.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Pretty, pretty bad blowout.

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.838 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it was
one of those bang!

00:27:54.838 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:10%
>> That's what this
trip's all about.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.654 align:middle line:10%
You drop into the thick and
you go about everything.

00:27:59.654 --> 00:28:01.485 align:middle line:10%
>> (SINGING) I'm coming home.

00:28:01.485 --> 00:28:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.686 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming home.

00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming home to the
place of unity in my heart,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.560 align:middle line:84%
