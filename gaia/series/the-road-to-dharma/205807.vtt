00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.070 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are even bringing

Life is a journey into the

And our life is marked

There's nothing wrong with
Sydney or LA or any of that,

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.110 align:middle line:90%
but it's continuous.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
You see, you have to
much stories and too much

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.230 align:middle line:84%
familiarity there--
too much hooks

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to define yourself with, to find
your safety escape mechanism.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:10%
Here, there is no place
to escape, nowhere to go.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize, the moment
we have an escape position,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:90%
you take it.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.095 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Most people, the moment that is
a-- you are in a trigger stage,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.428 align:middle line:84%
and there is an escape
route, we take it.

00:07:04.428 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%

authentically--

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.650 align:middle line:84%
every moment, and simple
moments as a little hike,

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and simple moments
when you feel cold.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize that there
are people sleeping naked

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
on the sides of the street,
and you have a rooftop.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you can find
gratitude, immense gratitude

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, then how are we
different than a person who's

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%

because he wants to buy food?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:90%
How are we different?

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we are in
a different circumstantial

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:84%
If we were put in that
circumstantial reality, who

I had the sleeping

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.818 align:middle line:90%
have the sleeping bags.

00:28:54.818 --> 00:28:57.360 align:middle line:84%
They all needed to go through

And he had that little
wicked laugh that he does.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And I just laughed
as well and thought,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:90%
everyone's going to be so happy.

This will be a straight up
hike to reach the first temple

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.270 align:middle line:84%
at 12,000 feet,
then a second ascent

It's a grueling hike
for an unknown reward

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:10%
and not all will

See, that's what this
journey is about.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
It's what we think we

what we think happened
to us in the past,

freedom from circumstance,
