didn't understand him

he was 97 years old.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And I immediately looked
at him and said, you're 97?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.240 align:middle line:84%

it really started-- you
know, every 100, 200 yards,

00:08:36.583 --> 00:08:38.000 align:middle line:10%

catch my breath.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:90%

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I was going to stay and
meditate at the temple.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.460 align:middle line:90%

my way up to the top,

symbolic of my sister,

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.910 align:middle line:84%
to not talk and just
be with themselves.

in getting to know Anand

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and studying with him
for six years now,

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I've asked him questions
like, how do you know

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:90%
some of the things you know?

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.033 align:middle line:84%
And he's amazed me with
some of his abilities.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And I won't go deep into it,
but one of the things he said

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
is that he just becomes
still like a clear pond.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And when you're still like
water, any ripple that comes,

you're able to see it.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm practicing the
stillness and really existing

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
in that gap.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.105 align:middle line:84%
Any little ripple off a person,
off anything, you really

00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:56.980 align:middle line:90%
know what's going on.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So he's able to read people
quite quickly because of how

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:90%
still and in the gap he exists.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.772 align:middle line:84%
And then in comes a ripple,
and he knows exactly what's

00:16:07.772 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:84%
going on with that
person and that person

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.688 align:middle line:90%

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:90%
May you be--

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel sorry for him?

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes it's just
indifference, you see?

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.823 align:middle line:84%
In the Yoga Sutra, Patanjali
says, the first thing

00:19:06.823 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:84%
is to the wicked
is indifference.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's too much to us in the
beginning to have compassion,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.140 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.910 align:middle line:84%
When somebody's
acting so disgusting.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So the first practice
is to be indifferent.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
That really has no
power, no meaning.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, and even in the
social scheme of things,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.500 align:middle line:84%
they have n no
power, no meaning.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.437 align:middle line:90%
>> That's where they get.

00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
do have their power.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> In that domain.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:90%
In their mind.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> In their mind.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:35.510 align:middle line:90%
In their story.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But in the truth, in the
reality, they have no meaning.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.870 align:middle line:84%
So indifferences
is the first one,

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:84%
and then the second
can be feeling sorry.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
They're just ignorant
particles, left and right.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But here, Shiva gives you
an opportunity to practice,

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
To not get into a
fairy tale land.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Life comes to you no
matter where you are.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't it?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Valuable lesson.

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, to have the
two experiences juxtaposed

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.125 align:middle line:84%
against each other
was ideal, actually.

00:20:04.125 --> 00:20:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.775 align:middle line:84%
So could that
little trigger rape

00:20:08.775 --> 00:20:10.693 align:middle line:90%
you of all that magnificence?

00:20:10.693 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I won't let it now.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:13.242 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Just for a split
second, though.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were
talking about last night.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That transcendence, you see?

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:84%
That transcendent
consciousness that you

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
exist in a transcendental
consciousness, that you--

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:90%
it's like children playing.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:90%
It has no meaning.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any power
to pull you left or right.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:38.468 align:middle line:90%
Your soul goes beyond that.

00:20:38.468 --> 00:20:39.510 align:middle line:90%
It has no meaning to you.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:90%
Say, OK.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:43.960 align:middle line:84%
It is a pig and it is a dog,
and it is an ignorant particle.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
A dog is a dog is a dog.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
That is the nature of a dog.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
A scorpion is a
scorpion is a scorpion.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.445 align:middle line:90%
It's the nature of a scorpion.

00:20:51.445 --> 00:20:52.315 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:53.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:56.763 align:middle line:84%
>> If you step on a scorpion
in LA, what will it do to you?

00:20:56.763 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sting you.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you step on a
scorpion in Himalayas,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.343 align:middle line:90%
what will it do to you?

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They don't have stingers?

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] They will sting you.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So no matter where you
step on the scorpion,

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:90%
it will sting you.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do
with you or the location.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the nature of the scorpion
to sting when you step on it.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you comprehend?

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.807 align:middle line:84%
>> So like, nature of ignorant
particle is to act ignorantly.

00:21:19.807 --> 00:21:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether you place
the ignorant particle

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.215 align:middle line:84%
on the great
Himalayas, magnificent,

00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by great masters, or
you place the ignorant particle

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:84%
in a community, you place that
ignorant particle in politics,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:30.830 align:middle line:90%
you place--

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:31.788 align:middle line:90%
>> They're omnipresent.

00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:32.588 align:middle line:90%
No doubt about it.

00:21:32.588 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So these people
exist everywhere,

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:90%
the state of consciousness.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you go to
security at the airport,

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.540 align:middle line:90%
they exist there too.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just the ultimate irony
to have it exist right here.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's the
beauty of it, right?

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the beauty of it.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was talking,
that the path is you.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:55.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not the path.

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
There is no path outside.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:90%
You are the path.

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.201 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:59.201 --> 00:22:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> As we headed
down from Tungnath,

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Anna was running in
excitement down a shortcut,

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
but lost control and was
heading right for a cliff.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Had she not forced
herself to fall,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:90%
she would have gone right over.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, she hits
her head directly on a rock.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.673 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.673 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I don't
want to hurt you,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:29.840 align:middle line:84%
but I might have to
just a little bit.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.206 align:middle line:90%
It's a beauty, eh?

00:22:37.206 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want
it to be a beauty.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:90%
>> It us.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.700 align:middle line:84%
That's something you'll remember
every time you comb your hair.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a whole rock field
literally a foot below her,

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.390 align:middle line:10%
two foot below her,
right where she stopped.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.550 align:middle line:10%
If she would have
tumbled one more time,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.937 align:middle line:10%
it would have been
dramatically worse.

00:22:52.937 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:10%
So it's kind of a
blessing in disguise

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.418 align:middle line:10%
that she stopped right there.

00:22:56.418 --> 00:22:58.210 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good that it's
oozing a little bit,

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.252 align:middle line:84%
because it's keeping the
swelling down, you know?

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:03.148 align:middle line:90%

00:23:11.585 --> 00:23:11.920 align:middle line:90%

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:12.895 align:middle line:90%
Checks the experience.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:18.662 --> 00:23:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Might be a little
pressure on that up there,

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:90%
because it's longer than that.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.710 align:middle line:84%

and keep the pressure on?

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:90%

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:90%
That's a good idea.

Really, first 10, 15

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
used to his speed,
which was a bit too,

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
let's say, aggressive
or too dynamic to me.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Then I did-- after
that, I settled down

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.550 align:middle line:90%
and I really enjoyed.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.010 align:middle line:84%
It was just like through

said, oh, I would never

she said, no way I'm going
to ride with Mark anymore.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.840 align:middle line:90%
I can see that Mark is a rock.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Sitting behind him, I
feel absolutely secure

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:90%

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.100 align:middle line:90%
She said, no way.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:90%
She had a terrible time today.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And she said, even
Mark mentioned

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.250 align:middle line:90%
that he almost lost her twice.

It might begin with belief.

Then somewhere, the
belief has to end

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.700 align:middle line:90%
and knowing has to begin.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So when belief ends, knowing
begins, that's spirituality.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:55.903 align:middle line:84%
An expansive, evolutionary,
fluid knowingness.

It's including everything.

idea is exclusive,
