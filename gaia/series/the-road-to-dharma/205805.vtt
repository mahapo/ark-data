which actually means nothing

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:40.570 align:middle line:90%
in the--

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.340 align:middle line:84%
on this road, it's
more like 60k.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> As we leave for this last
10 kilometers to Kedarnath,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
we're very aware
the later it gets,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
the later we start our hike
up to the top of Kedarnath.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So we could be going from
a hard, mud-filled day

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:84%
of riding in scorching heat to
an incredibly steep hike that

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
sees us arriving in frigid,
absolutely pitch black night

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.725 align:middle line:84%
conditions at the
temple of Shiva.

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.717 align:middle line:84%
>> But moments like these,
journeys like these,

00:10:29.717 --> 00:10:32.300 align:middle line:84%
that's the whole point of this
pilgrimage is for you to become

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:84%
aware, absolutely,
of your own programs,

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of your own capacities,
how the mind catches you.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of
life itself, mastery.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.148 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
In the "Bhagavad
Gita," Krishna says,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
"Be thou the master
of your mind, Arjuna,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
not a master of a
thousand armies.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.870 align:middle line:90%
Be thou the master of yourself."

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.678 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we can
have so many things,

00:10:58.678 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
but the only real thing
we don't have is ourself.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.380 align:middle line:10%
That's why this ritual practice
called self-realization,

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:10%
you begin to realize
who you really are.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
conditioned part of us which

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:90%
gets conflicted, isn't it?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:90%
That's our journey.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Why we are joining together
is to really realize

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:90%
that all there is is love.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.750 align:middle line:10%
And then the fight
that we create

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:10%
is only self-imposed,
self-sabotaging.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
We are a lot more powerful
and a lot more capable

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:90%
than we ever imagined.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.397 align:middle line:84%
That's the beginning and
end of all teachings.

00:11:35.397 --> 00:11:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> As we begin the
pilgrimage to Kedarnath,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that Ken is
withdrawing himself a bit from

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
the group, staying alone, and
playing that natural skeptic

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
who wants to observe before
he fully jumps into this thing

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.970 align:middle line:90%
called spirituality.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Jeff told me that
I was too protective.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:10%
I was like, well that's--

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm the mom.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.025 align:middle line:90%
That's my job.

00:12:08.025 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
At home, I'm the-- you
know, I'm the bad guy.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:10.993 align:middle line:90%
I'm the rule maker.

00:12:10.993 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was kind
of like a hard-ass.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to come--
we've got to come

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.213 align:middle line:90%
to some kind of agreement.

00:12:15.213 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've asked
Anand for some help.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And he said later--

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
he told me just to absorb
all I can right now,

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and later we'll talk
about it before we leave.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.490 align:middle line:84%
We started together,
but you know,

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted him to be
able to do his own--

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
go at his own pace,
do his own thing.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So he went ahead of me.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:84%
>> As Kedarnath is a sacred
pilgrimage for many Indians,

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
there are people here,
including elders,

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
who've waited their
whole lives to come.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So there are horses here
to help those who can't

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.300 align:middle line:90%
make this tremendous hike.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
Fred decides to hop on a horse
as just three months ago,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
he had a hip
replacement surgery.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:90%
>> 14 kilometers straight up--

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:90%
I thought I was going to die.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
I kept saying, like,
fuck this, fuck this.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.283 align:middle line:90%
That was, like, my mantra.

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:84%
I was trying to get
that out of my head.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm like-- but I couldn't.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:13.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:84%

continuous hiking straight up,

we're arriving at what's
not even the halfway point

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%
of the hike.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We'll take this first break,
and regroup, and then make

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that final push to get
up to the top, which

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
is still nearly 3,500 feet
away, before the sun goes down.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.282 align:middle line:90%

>> I couldn't get in the zone.

00:13:58.091 --> 00:13:59.033 align:middle line:10%
I tried.

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't get in that zone.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.575 align:middle line:10%
>> You've got to
keep-- do the mantra.

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:10%
Just keep doing the mantra.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.283 align:middle line:10%
Stay with the sound,
Om Namah Shivaya.

00:14:06.283 --> 00:14:08.220 align:middle line:10%
Because the mind
starts to go, and you

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.340 align:middle line:10%
start paying attention to that.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:10%
It's not like you
are incapable of it.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:10%

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.550 align:middle line:10%
>> In this very moment,
you are on top, right now.

Right now you are at the bottom,
and right now you are here,

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.880 align:middle line:10%
and right now you're at the top.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:10%
So you've got to just
visualize yourself

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.430 align:middle line:10%
there and pull yourself.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:10%
So it's not like, when
am I going to make it?

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.623 align:middle line:10%
That question is not even there.

00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:10%
You are already there.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.435 align:middle line:10%
You're just going to
meet yourself in time.

00:14:31.435 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:10%
And what happens
is that when you

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.975 align:middle line:10%
start to get a little
tired, the thoughts

00:14:34.975 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:10%
start to give up,
finding an escape route.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.680 align:middle line:10%
And so you've got to just stay
with the mantra, the sound, Om

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:10%
Namah Shivaya.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:10%
Because you're
going a Shiva place,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:10%
stay with that Om Namah Shivaya.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:10%
You just stay with that sound.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> "Om Namah Shivaya"
means to really transcend

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the circumstances, specifically
to go beyond birth, life,

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and death, beyond the part
of you that exists in time.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
When you go beyond
that, then you

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:84%
find freedom from circumstance,
freedom from time--

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Om Namah Shivaya.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And these mantras are
very, very powerful.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's something Anand has
taught me from the beginning.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
When I was first in
India, I got sick.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And I remember Anand
silently doing a mantra

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
and sending it to me.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And for 30 minutes,
I could feel it.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:90%
I felt completely better.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:90%
I felt in a different frequency.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And so I just stayed with that.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is all from him
silently saying a mantra.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So I knew quite quickly
the power of mantra,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:84%
the power of sound, and
the power of my teacher.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> As my master used to say,
the true teacher's job is not

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to lead you to him.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:84%
A true master's job
is to lead you to you.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.190 align:middle line:84%
He told me one day, if you
want to be pleased by me,

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.315 align:middle line:90%
don't be around me.

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:21.940 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
pleased, and somebody

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to put a Band-Aid on your ego
and brush you a little bit,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.880 align:middle line:84%
make you feel better, get
a massage in the evening,

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
get up in the morning,
do a little exercise.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:90%
It'll make you feel better.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.937 align:middle line:84%
But if you are really about
awakening and freedom,

00:16:34.937 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:90%
then you come to me.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.728 align:middle line:84%
And I will not promise
that you will feel good.

00:16:37.728 --> 00:16:48.822 align:middle line:90%


00:16:48.822 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I was
saying that mantra,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.530 align:middle line:90%
and I was pretty good with it.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.485 align:middle line:84%
And then people would
ask me if I want a horse.

00:16:54.485 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:90%
And I'd be like--

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:84%
every guy you'd pass,
he's like, want a horse?

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.440 align:middle line:90%
It was like, yes-- no.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't want a horse.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was getting dark.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But I finally got to the top
after almost puking a million

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.040 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Like, I had to keep stopping.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:90%
My hands were tingly.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And got in the
building and saw Anand.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, you made it.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And I just bawled my head off.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:90%
And I just released so much.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:90%

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Just answer that question.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I know-- I knew
that I was safe.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, I could
have wait for a while

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:90%
to just catch me up.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But what kept you-- let
me ask you a question then.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Then what kept you from
accepting the truth which

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:90%
you knew inside?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you-- why would
you not accept that truth

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.726 align:middle line:84%
as more valid than the
panic of your mind?

00:26:35.726 --> 00:26:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Why would you not accept that
inner voice which kept saying

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:90%
that you are safe?

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Why would you not-- why
would you bypass that?

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Why would you not listen to that
more than the pathetic voice

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:48.212 align:middle line:90%
in your head?

00:26:48.212 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
All that was
happening was you were

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.500 align:middle line:84%
walking on a straight road
up the mountain with nowhere

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Did you see how
small that town is?

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:01.367 align:middle line:84%
You would have to
try hard to get lost.

00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:02.450 align:middle line:90%
You'd have to be on drugs.

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just the empty
road, almost full moon,

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and no one is around.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.460 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's beauty, isn't it?

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.027 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now I can
tell, not yesterday.

00:27:15.027 --> 00:27:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the triggered
feeling state.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.985 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
are talking about,

00:27:17.985 --> 00:27:20.270 align:middle line:84%
that when you are in a
triggered feeling state,

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.760 align:middle line:84%
you use your mind,
you use your senses

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:90%
to justify that triggered state.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:84%
So the thing of beauty
becomes the things

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:90%
of-- thing of horror.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:90%
To these guys, they were--

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.210 align:middle line:84%
once you were-- at least four
people came to me, oh Anand,

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:34.930 align:middle line:90%
you have to come outside.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:36.597 align:middle line:84%
Look at the moon, and
look at the stars.

00:27:36.597 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
How many of you saw the moon
and the stars last night?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.984 align:middle line:90%
What did you experience?

00:27:40.984 --> 00:27:42.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Bliss.

00:27:42.085 --> 00:27:42.885 align:middle line:90%
>> Love.

00:27:42.885 --> 00:27:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Gratitude.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:27:45.042 --> 00:27:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in
the triggered feeling

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.170 align:middle line:84%
state, the moon, the
darkness becomes haunting.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:55.803 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.803 --> 00:27:58.220 align:middle line:84%
>> At this point in the journey,
we're starting to see how

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.320 align:middle line:84%
quickly we can all
fall from grace.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.258 align:middle line:84%
I got hit with a dose of
Elle's blame and anger.

00:28:04.258 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But in general, it seems
like the group is really

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:84%
starting to embrace, at
least intellectually, what

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Anand is trying to say.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But we'll see tonight,
as the sun goes down

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and we're faced again
with wet blankets

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and freezing cold temperatures,
just how conditioned

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:19.860 align:middle line:90%
our minds are for comfort.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times in life you
are faced with moments where

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.310 align:middle line:84%
you don't have what
you think you need?

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.824 align:middle line:84%
But do you really need
what do you think?

00:28:29.824 --> 00:28:33.520 align:middle line:10%
We are so caught up in
the periphery of our likes

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and dislikes, of our
agreements and disagreements,

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:10%
and our little conditioning.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The true invitation
of this life is

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to discover the
truth of who you are.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only thing
that will set us free.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth of who you
are is incompatible to any image

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:53.860 align:middle line:90%
you have of yourself.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:90%

come around this corner,

and the gravel--

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:10%
I hit a patch of gravel.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.280 align:middle line:10%

But you can't believe
with your own eyes.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:10%

everything you know about
