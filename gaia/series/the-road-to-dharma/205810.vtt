these guys a short time,

I've faced death

on previous adventures
and all this, you know,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.545 align:middle line:84%
there was something in
me that was just still

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:13.180 align:middle line:90%
not totally at ease with it.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:84%

uh-uh, not yet.

was panicking in the water.

00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:90%

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, my heart was pounding.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Adam's
heart was pounding.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:10%
>> It got real for
a second, you know?

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:10%
The going under and the gulping.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.940 align:middle line:10%

as his spirit and
his emotions go,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%

time where he was sure

that the mother was
going to take him

and then she just spit
him back out, that had

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
to have changed something
inside of him I'm sure.

is two or three days before he

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
left his body, I went into his

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:90%
a rock.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.603 align:middle line:84%
He said, OK, let's meditate
and we meditated for an hour

00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:42.075 align:middle line:84%
and I was so full of
energy, strong, powerful.

00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:90%
So we called him Maharaji.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Maharaji means the
king, the royal one.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Maharaj meaning
the king of kings.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And the day he left his
body I remember he asked--

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:90%
he called my mother--

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
because always suspected
that God a sacred feminine--

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to go to the Ganga right
there in that moment

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.240 align:middle line:90%
and bring Ganga water.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:84%
She brought the Ganga water and
it was full moon that night.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.060 align:middle line:84%
She brought the
Ganga water and he

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
asked her to put three
drops in his mouth.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And she put three drops of
the Ganga's water in his mouth

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:90%
and he was gone.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Third drop and he left his body.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I think that's brilliant.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.250 align:middle line:84%
As in the Vajrayana

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%

says our whole life

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:84%
is a preparation for the moment
of death, how conscious you

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.300 align:middle line:90%
are in that moment.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So I think he was
pretty conscious.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:90%
Third drop.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:90%
He timed it perfectly.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.850 align:middle line:90%
So I sense him is always here.

pushing me here and there,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:18.140 align:middle line:84%
you know, and mostly about
kind of stepping into my power,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of coming out of
my shell, you know?

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- that
stays with me every day

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.720 align:middle line:84%
since we've been back
here and translates

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to everything for me, right?

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
From riding the bike to just
sitting and talking to people.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Like it just sits in the
back of my mind, you know?

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And really I think freedom
just means the freedom

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.680 align:middle line:84%
to be your full
and present self.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've seen
it happen among us

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and I know it's
happened for me now.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:56.180 align:middle line:84%
You've got to just strip away
that who you think you are,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%
that who you want
other people to think

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
you are, to just be who you are
and strengthen that every day,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I think
freedom to me means anyways.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just to be
that, just who I am

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and the best who I am that I am.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think as a man you're
probably stronger as a man

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
to be able to care
and understand

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:24.410 align:middle line:84%
than you are to, you know, be
a bigger man, be a tougher man.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Like who cares really, you know?

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
able to be a man

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.573 align:middle line:84%
and show some sensitivity
at the same time.

00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what needs to happen.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:42.588 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.588 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm not of the
thing that, you know,

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.755 align:middle line:84%
once you come together you
have to stay together forever.

00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:90%
That's just an idea.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It's nowhere in
nature it exists.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Nature is playing and they
come together and move away,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.400 align:middle line:90%
come together and move away.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's not--
away is not denial.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fight.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.703 align:middle line:90%
It's just a natural progression.

00:22:01.703 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Some people are meant to come
together and stay together

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.880 align:middle line:90%
forever.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Some people are meant to come
together and serve each other

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.210 align:middle line:84%
on a certain level
of evolution and then

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
they transition onto
different pathways that

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.480 align:middle line:84%
is not necessarily bad, which
we have created such a stigma

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:90%
upon, you know, on divorce.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So for there to be
a divorce, there

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
has to be first a marriage, huh?

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's the marriage which is
to be blamed, not the divorce.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.722 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing of it, even when

00:22:34.722 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I was sharing with
Jeff and Jen, is

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.080 align:middle line:84%
to drop this idea of
OK, what can I get.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.430 align:middle line:90%
This is the problem, you see?

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:84%
What you have to start in
relating is how can I serve?

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:47.430 align:middle line:84%
How can I help
this person evolve?

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
How can I create an
environment for this person

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
to have an expansive
experience of life?

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
Not from an arrogant,
self-righteous place

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.030 align:middle line:84%
but from a very humble,
whole, complete space.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:10%
>> She's done a lot of things
on her own just to get to this

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.310 align:middle line:10%
point that's really helped out,
and now I've realized that I

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:10%
have to maybe open up more.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being so
reserved and chilled out,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
I have to actually acknowledge
the things that she's done

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and really celebrate
it with her, you know,

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.513 align:middle line:84%
so she doesn't
feel alone in this,

00:23:22.513 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:90%
that we're together in this.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, Anand asked us to
write some notes to each other.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The first letters kind
of apologizing for maybe

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:84%
what we've not
focused on each other

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and been a support
to each other.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the main thing
that I really apologize

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:90%
is really neglect.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been there and
I thought I've been there,

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:84%
but I've just been
a shell at times.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I apologized for the
years that I used to drink.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:03.230 align:middle line:10%
I apologized for resenting him
for being gone all the time.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I apologized for
not communicating

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:10.900 align:middle line:84%
or being too harsh, being
too hard, building up walls.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.710 align:middle line:90%
A lot of things.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.250 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I'm totally
changed from this trip.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I think I said
before I'm softer.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.240 align:middle line:90%
I just feel like a new person.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I think freedom means
not living in your head.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I was in my head all the
time creating stories,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.920 align:middle line:84%
creating problems that
didn't need to be there.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.230 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, the
hike to Kedarnath,

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:39.300 align:middle line:10%
the long motorcycle
rides were the things

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.850 align:middle line:10%
that got me out of my head
even more so than meditation.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I felt
totally free, when

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:90%
there was no thoughts, no--

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.140 align:middle line:90%
nothing there.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Just empty and just living
and being fully present.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's freedom.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're definitely--
we connected again.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:84%
We still have a lot
to work on, but this--

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.020 align:middle line:90%
it brought us back to this--

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
I think we're on
the same page now.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I think we're back together.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at him sleeping
last night and I was like,

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I really love him.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm in love again with more
than just him, with everything.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:41.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> After my experience two days
ago swimming across the river,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm reminded of how powerful
and how sacred she is.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I think in general
it's shown me to see

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:90%
the sacred in all of life.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> With the guru, I think
it's really important to have

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.080 align:middle line:84%
a sacred relationship that
sometimes you do need to shut

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
up and listen and really
drop your agenda if you want

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.462 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.462 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:84%
I would also say
that, you know, it

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to be
the form of a guru.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
At any moment it could
be something else.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.685 align:middle line:84%
It could be your
relationship and you

00:26:20.685 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:84%
can treat that as
sacred and now you're

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
starting to be on the
path and let there be

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:90%
something sacred in our lives.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.530 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.947 align:middle line:84%
Why not have
something mysterious?

00:26:28.947 --> 00:26:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Why not have something sacred?

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Would you rather not?

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Would you rather not have
anything sacred or mysterious

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.680 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think we choose
to not have that.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
exactly, but I think

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.410 align:middle line:90%
we choose to not have that.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And so that's something I
think anyone can practice,

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.410 align:middle line:84%
be it the moment they
walk up to the person

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and say hello and treat
them in a respectful way

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.907 align:middle line:84%
just because they're valuing
that moment and the time

00:26:57.907 --> 00:26:58.865 align:middle line:90%
and that person's eyes.

00:26:58.865 --> 00:27:03.870 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> We traveled to
four sacred peaks,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:12.170 align:middle line:84%
but those peaks can be
anything and anywhere.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And on this journey
I think we all

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:84%
realized that we have the
choice of how we see life.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.554 align:middle line:90%
We have that freedom.

00:27:21.554 --> 00:27:24.014 align:middle line:90%

happens inside of us until we

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:48.805 align:middle line:84%
are not radically ready to pay
attention to that, you know?

Till then, it's

Shiva says to the goddess,
the master to his beloved,

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:21.250 align:middle line:84%
pay not attention to my
words, divine feminine,

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:84%
pay attention to the gap between
my words because in the gap you

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:84%
will find the being and
you will merge in it.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.440 align:middle line:84%
When you merge in the
being, all understanding

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.680 align:middle line:84%
will dawn on you because
you are it already.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.670 align:middle line:84%

But I think human beings,
we can agree with it,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:90%
but it takes a lot of courage.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
It takes a deep
understanding of detachment.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.160 align:middle line:84%
It takes a deep understanding
of stepping in one's own power.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
It takes a deep awareness to
take an absolute responsibility

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.240 align:middle line:90%
of one's existence.
