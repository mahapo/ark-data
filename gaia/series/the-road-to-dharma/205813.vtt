Someone has to become empty.

And if you are too full,
too arrogant, too proud,

ideologies, and stories,

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.850 align:middle line:90%
you can never tune in.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.500 align:middle line:84%
So to tune in, one has to
be empty, empty of thought,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.955 align:middle line:84%
empty of stories,
empty of fear, empty.

of power, or vortex,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:84%
or any place to receive or to
learn, one has to turn empty,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
not to agree or disagree,
like or dislike.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Drop all judgment.

So even for me, I feel like a
ghost or a wanderer in life.

You know, I could have
gone a whole lifetime

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:90%

And I met Jennifer.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And I realized
when we first met,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
it was probably, like a lot of
people, a toxic relationship.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, you meet somebody in
a bar, and you grow together.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And since then, we've grown,
and we've quit drinking,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:90%
quit doing all that other stuff.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I guess for
me, the relationship is--

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't want it just to
be having a person here

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:90%
to listen to me.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I want to share my experiences
positively with Jennifer.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
But the definition of
relationship is it is tough.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%

They're not in a

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Because religions are based

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
We are on a journey
to realize what

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
it means to be truly human,
what it means to be truly alive.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And these places offer
up an opportunity,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
because there is immense power.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
All the yogis who came here were
not because of some religion,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:90%
see?

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:84%
They came here to be
in an environment,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.380 align:middle line:84%
to be in an
energetic space which

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
was conducive to going
deeper within oneself,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.760 align:middle line:90%
to realizing who I am truly.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Who am I beyond all
the content of my mind?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Because only the truth of
who I am will set me free.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
So all of the yogis and
the masters who came here

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
was to discover self,
to realize self.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And then people have experiences
like this in a place.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.110 align:middle line:84%
That place starts to reverberate
with that energy, you see?

So if you go to a bar, and
it's been a bar for 20 years,

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and now it's not a bar--
but when you go in there,

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
into the bar, in that
space, you can still

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:90%
feel the vibrational energy.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So when these masters,
or these beings,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
have been meditating in these
mountains, in these spots,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
the place starts to
reverberate at that frequency.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:00.017 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.017 --> 00:11:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we have been

the practices.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So the riders could sense it the
moment we entered this valley.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is not to do with
any particular religion.

Hindu religion-- no.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:90%
We are here as human beings.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to tap into
the heritage of humanity,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.718 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
heritage of humanity.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And these great Himalayas,
these great mountains,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and these sacred spots
offer that opportunity.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But not everybody who
comes here will feel that.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Definitely a lot-- a lot
of people will come here.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
They will ring the bell
and do the little rituals

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
on the surface, go around
the motion, you see,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.950 align:middle line:84%
just go through the
motion and be gone.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to really
tap into the profound energy

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of the space, you
have to go subtler.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Only the beings who come with a
specific state of consciousness

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and beings who are ready to
be empty will be able to tune

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:90%
to that reverberation.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.408 align:middle line:84%
And their being will start to
reverberate at that frequency.

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I have never seen
anyone pet a cow.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.182 align:middle line:10%
>> I love cows.

00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:37.858 align:middle line:10%


00:12:37.858 --> 00:12:38.900 align:middle line:10%
>> That cow was in bliss.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The cows love you too.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>> They're so sweet.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.740 align:middle line:10%
There will be no more
meat in my house, ever.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.030 align:middle line:10%
Like, I'm already vegetarian,
but Jeff will get them no more.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:10%
>> No more, not after that.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.533 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:10%
>> He seemed pretty
convinced too,

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:10%
like after seeing that and
talking to Anand for a moment,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:12:59.930 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Every being has the right
to live, wants to live.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:10%
And why would you want
to ingest your body

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:10%
with something dead, something
which has struggled to live?

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:10%
All you're eating,
really, is misery.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:10%
You're eating misery.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:10%
That struggle, that
moment of that struggle,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:10%
and what's happened in
that struggle, the brain

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:10%
of the animal, this triggers
release of hormones which gets

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:10%
absorbed in the muscles.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.506 align:middle line:10%
And you're eating that.

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Why would you do that to
yourself, or to the animal,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.830 align:middle line:10%
or to the-- ?

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Transferring to the people.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:10%
>> And then you can justify
the protein or the--

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:10%
I have never, in my life, ever
had even a bite of anything

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:10%
that died.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:46.850 align:middle line:10%
And I think I'm in pretty
good shape for the protein.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:10%
Climb any mountain.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:10%
>> You need iron.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.080 align:middle line:10%
You need iron.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Climb any mountain
in flip flops.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:14:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Today Anand gives us some
time to explore Badrinath,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
to slow down and absorb
the town, and the temple,

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and these great Himalayas
in whatever way we like

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and on our own.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> When we first met, we would
fit together on the couch

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%
so well, you know?

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Our hearts were beating.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And our heads, our
minds was as one.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And we ventured into having
these beautiful children,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.500 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.210 align:middle line:90%
They're totally killer.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that over
time, I'd come home from work,

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.030 align:middle line:84%
and I'd take the kids
to give her her space.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:90%
And we'd have a good time.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But I realized that I wasn't
making those special date

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.550 align:middle line:90%
nights for her.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
I was letting her
have her space alone.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But I was with the kids and
forgetting that opportunity

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.022 align:middle line:90%
to really spend with her.

00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:84%
You know, 12 years
later it's like, dude,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:14.688 align:middle line:90%
where's the date night?

00:15:14.688 --> 00:15:15.488 align:middle line:90%
Shit.

00:15:15.488 --> 00:15:16.792 align:middle line:90%
You know, she plans them all.

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:20.648 align:middle line:90%


00:15:20.648 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm going to come back for
some of these for souvenirs.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm happy that we got to
go out to dinner by ourselves,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:90%
like a date night.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And now we're walking
around looking

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.535 align:middle line:90%
at this beautiful temple.

00:15:35.535 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really happy.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
>> When feeling this Temple of
Badrinath and any of the sacred

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:84%
peaks, it's really interesting
to know the energy behind it.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:84%
For example, when they were
first creating Badrinath Temple

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and erecting the statue
of Narayana, which is also

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
called Vishnu,
many powerful yogis

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
gathered, pouring
energy into it for days.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
They would meditate, chant, and
even wake it up in the morning.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They'd bathe it, feed it, and
continue to do so to this day.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
In essence, they're seeing
and feeling it as alive,

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.720 align:middle line:90%
as having spirit and energy.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel a transition.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:54.500 align:middle line:10%
I feel a shift happening in
myself and in everyone here

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:10%
that whatever it is
that we came here

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:10%
with that we wanted to let
go of is going to be gone.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:10%
My father was very abusive
emotionally and mentally.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And from that, there's that
feeling of not being enough.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I couldn't
achieve that love.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.070 align:middle line:84%
The last few years, I've really
been working through that.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
But that self-doubt
has still been there.

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons why I'm here

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is to work through
that, rise above.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A true life has no war
in it, no violence in it,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:90%
no lack in it, no fear in it.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we are only living
with the mask, you see--

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.910 align:middle line:84%
the mask, the facade,
afraid to be found out.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.305 align:middle line:84%
So we have to keep
the facade up somehow.

00:18:20.305 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we
are threatened,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.800 align:middle line:84%
somebody threatens
that facade, we judge.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.920 align:middle line:84%
We get together to
pull that person down.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So my master used to
always say, if you

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.120 align:middle line:84%
want to be liked by everyone,
you have to die today.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:90%
Because still, you are alive.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
There will be people--
and you speak the truth,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:84%
more people will dislike
you than like you.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:19:23.025 align:middle line:90%


00:19:23.025 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:90%
>> My baby.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Today we head past Badrinath
to the last town before Tibet,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Mana.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.220 align:middle line:84%
From there we hike into
the Himalayas to a point

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.785 align:middle line:84%
where it's 60 miles of pure
Himalayan peaks just flooding

00:19:40.785 --> 00:19:41.785 align:middle line:90%
you with their presence.

00:19:41.785 --> 00:20:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, on this trip, I never
expected that we would be

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.888 align:middle line:10%
taking pictures of each other.

00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:10%
This is us by the bridge.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:10%
This is us by the waterfall.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:10%
You know, we both
have to become whole,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.610 align:middle line:10%
each member, so we
can come together

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:10%
and share the experiences.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:10%
So I feel closer to
her, because we never

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.985 align:middle line:10%
have enough time to be close.

00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:03.575 align:middle line:10%


00:21:03.575 --> 00:21:09.540 align:middle line:10%
I know there's still a hard
path that we both have to take,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.620 align:middle line:10%
but it's getting there.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> This concept of relationship,
a lot of time we enter a ship,

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a
dead entity, you see?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Now we are on a
ship, and that's it.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And somehow this ship
will take us somewhere.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.835 align:middle line:84%
And then we cease to
relate to each other.

00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We are on a ship,
and we are kind

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.007 align:middle line:90%
of just, what's your problem?

00:21:33.007 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you fine?

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
I have-- I give you
everything, right?

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a common
thing in the ship.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:43.600 align:middle line:84%
On the ship, when there is
waiters to serve you food,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and the weather is fine,
and it's going from point A

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%
to point B, isn't it?

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And in between, people
forget to relate, to connect,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:84%
to be present, to listen,
to just observe each other.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And the distance keeps
increasing in time.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So I always say, don't
get on a ship, you know?

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Stay on the shore.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
ship, it's like it's

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.100 align:middle line:84%
based on the concept or an
idea that somehow you will

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
get somewhere because of this.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.573 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the misery begins.

00:22:20.573 --> 00:22:22.740 align:middle line:10%
You start to think that the
other person is supposed

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:28.160 align:middle line:10%
to make you happy, you know?

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.980 align:middle line:10%
And that's such a fallacy.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.295 align:middle line:90%
It's an atrocity.

00:22:32.295 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, you
have to come to whole.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.210 align:middle line:84%
When two wholes relate to
each other, there is beauty.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But when you are conflicted
inside, for a momentary time,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
for some time, your attention
shifts on the other,

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:84%
and you feel a
pleasurable experience.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But then the familiarity--
it becomes familiar.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.398 align:middle line:84%
It becomes part
of your who am I.

00:22:57.398 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
When it becomes the moment,
it becomes part of your who

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:84%
am I. The attention
shifts back to the misery,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and what's missing,
and the split part.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.018 align:middle line:84%
So if we stay long enough here
without a practice-- you see?

00:23:09.018 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
If we stay long enough-- like
a lot of people in the village,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
they stay long enough here,
it becomes part of their

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.090 align:middle line:90%
who am I. Do you understand?

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And then it's just
a mundane life.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.900 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
transformational occurring.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:84%
They're not connected
to the source.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:90%
There is no practice.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It's just going
through the emotion,

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.570 align:middle line:90%
going through the emotion.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.600 align:middle line:84%
As I always say, the
only way of relating

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.180 align:middle line:84%
is evolutionary, where the
primary awareness is how can I

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.075 align:middle line:84%
serve you in your evolution,
not to make you feel better,

00:23:43.075 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to put a Band-Aid on
your little thing.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go shopping,
or let's do this.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:90%
But how can we evolve?

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:90%
How can we transform?

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:90%
How can we expand?

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.120 align:middle line:90%
How can we set each other free?

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Not how can we set--

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:84%
hold each other hostage, but
how can we set each other free?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
coming from that space,

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:08.805 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole
different way of relating.

00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment you point
finger one at somebody else,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.400 align:middle line:90%
the three are pointing at you.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I think one of
the biggest violent acts we do

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.720 align:middle line:90%
is blame.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
The moment there is--
because you are with me.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:90%
I was happy a moment before.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:90%
And now I am unhappy.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And you are in front of me.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.580 align:middle line:90%
So you are the problem.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.500 align:middle line:90%


00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we really
turn honest, you

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
begin to realize that the only
being who can set you free

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.520 align:middle line:90%
is you.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you really
begin to realize that.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Then the person in front of
you is just a reflection.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:90%
And you want to serve.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:90%
How can I set you--

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.300 align:middle line:84%
how can I help you
in your journey?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:57.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when are in touch with
that source, you're so full.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:03.580 align:middle line:84%
You're so full of life,
there's nothing missing.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.630 align:middle line:90%
So now let's go on our ways.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll take a couple
of hours just by ourselves.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Go wherever you want to be
silent, but not down, up.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.670 align:middle line:84%
You can be here or anywhere
for a couple of hours.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:90%
Just be with yourself, yeah?

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:90%
No together.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.635 align:middle line:84%
No two people together,
separate, alone, by oneself.

00:25:32.635 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%

00:26:42.683 --> 00:26:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And I finally told
him, well, what

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I've been thinking about is
that if you're so different here

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:84%
with these other people and
you can't be like that with me

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:84%
in your family, then
something's wrong.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe I need
to set him free

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:84%
if that's who he really is and
he's not happy where he is.

Most people, in their love,
they're only insecure in it.

love is freedom.

The true love will set you free.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
It won't bring insecurities,
