00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Fred, he's 75 years old.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.640 align:middle line:84%
He came from a generation that
your wife looked after you.

This is how things are.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:90%
It's the war generation.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've just watched
him kind of unfold

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
as this whole thing goes.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
Just like a sponge, he
just keeps soaking it in

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and soaking it in.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And good for him.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm proud of him all
the way for sure.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Last night, he was telling
me that this is the strongest he

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:90%
has felt in years.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:84%
He's the oldest he has
ever been right now

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and this is the strongest
he has felt in years.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.642 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking,
I said because--

00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I told him, because you're
not identifying just

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle line:90%
with your body.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
There's something
greater pulling you.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
You're accessing something
deeper in yourself.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.610 align:middle line:84%
His eyes were full when
he talked about it.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'm going
home more aware, stronger,

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and more present.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the real
purpose of the journey.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So people are really tapping
in, getting stronger,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.408 align:middle line:90%
getting more silent, mostly.

00:05:47.408 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
A few have a little
more money to do.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, by the
time we are in Rishikesh,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:84%
they'll surrender their
little defense mechanisms

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:90%
which are still going on.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.006 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm really proud of you, man.

00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Mark.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Really provided evidence to
someone who is very analytical

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:10%
that there is something
beyond physical.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of the beast is
I need the proof, if you will.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Although, I've heard
repeatedly, Ken,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.950 align:middle line:84%
just kind of jump in the
water, and embrace, it

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and don't test the
temperature, and the like.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.220 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, I wish us
women kind of gone in like

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.400 align:middle line:10%
the extraordinary area.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Our area was like a dungeon.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.557 align:middle line:84%
So I'm standing in there and
I asked the woman next to me.

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And she's a little
scared, because she

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know English.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
She taps on her daughter to
try and talk to me, because I'm

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
saying, do we go naked?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Do we wear underwear?

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:55.710 align:middle line:90%
What do I do?

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's giggling and it was
a very sweet feminine moment

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.885 align:middle line:84%
everyone just getting
into it and kind

00:07:02.885 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:84%
of laughing, and giggling,
kind of screaming,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:90%
because it's so cold.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And then rushing to put
on our clothes again.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:16.762 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I think the
journey is not yet done.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
We are going to be in Rishikesh
where further integration will

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.488 align:middle line:84%
The most important
work will happen

00:07:22.488 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:84%
once we get back down on the
banks of the divine mother

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Ganga and we go do
some introspection.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Because people have
been going, they

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how
much has shifted.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:10%
>> That was an
unbelievable experience,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:10%
climbing straight
up the mountain,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:10%
going into that nectar, chanting
in the temples, coming down.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was
a great last peak

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to climb before preparing for
that little mountain road.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The longest ride,
so stay focused.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
In the long wide, what happens
after a while, you know,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:90%
you just lose a little focus.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.239 align:middle line:90%
So stay present, stay focused.

00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
Got it?

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.260 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's tune in.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Stay connect to the
breath, deep breath.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Connect it to the mountains,
the road, to the sky,

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to nature, to every being
in the circle and out.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Visualize in your
mind's eye everybody

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
arriving at the central
center and at Lakshman

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Jhula safe, sound, and happy.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Anand has set out a very
long day of riding to get

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:10%
to our home base of Rishikesh.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.330 align:middle line:10%
To make it there would
be a 12 hour ride,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:10%
covering 285 kilometers.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And in India, things
never go as planned.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The thought of riding
12 hours after 20 days

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of constant hiking
and biking is only

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.070 align:middle line:84%
tempered by the allure of
our peaceful destination

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:90%
on the Holy Ganga river.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And as Anand said,
follow the river home.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If I go back and I'm more
loving and Jeff is more loving,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.070 align:middle line:84%
then that's, at
least, a huge start.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Selflessness, inclusion of
all, not exclusion, inclusion.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a strong principle.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.460 align:middle line:84%
A woman will test
the man on that.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And if he's weak, she will
lose all respect for him.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So one of the strong
principles should

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
be an expansive view, a
grander sense of life,

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
a grander sense of
self, a selflessness,

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
not a self-centered living.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not about me.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.957 align:middle line:84%
All I want is a
true man will test

00:11:21.957 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and she would not respect
the man, even though she

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.530 align:middle line:90%
might feel happy in the moment.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So till you're in
your power, you're

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.830 align:middle line:84%
trying to feed off
each other, and you're

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:90%
going to destroy each other.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.105 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, to
every individual according

00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
to their understanding
and their person

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.647 align:middle line:84%
and they had to come up
with their principles.

00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And not to confuse principles
with dogma or just opinions.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Principles are beyond your
conditioned way of thinking.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:90%
They are more universal.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.558 align:middle line:84%
They not only heal
you, but heal everybody

00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:90%
around you and the world.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:12:17.647 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.647 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> All of a sudden, we hear
that bang, bang, bang, bang,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:90%
crinkle, crinkle, crash.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Look down and there it was.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just throw it in the car.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:90%
It makes it sound better.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Faster too.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I always thought,
yeah, dude, I got it.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm spiritual.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:10%
I know I'm kind-hearted.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:10%
And I still think that,
but now, you know, there's

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:10%
still a guideline that I can
try to take home and instill

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.408 align:middle line:10%
with my family.

00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:47.825 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
trip's all about.

00:12:47.825 --> 00:12:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Drop the frickin'
ego about everything.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, figure it out and then go
home and be the man and be the,

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I guess, leader for
my kids and my wife.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:90%
We can all get together.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:10%
>> And then that's
when I was like, well,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.700 align:middle line:10%
we can either just start over
or keep bringing up things from

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:10%
the past.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:90%
He's like, OK, let's start over.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:35.523 align:middle line:90%


00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:37.690 align:middle line:10%
>> I've said it before, I
wish she was here with me,

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.520 align:middle line:10%
more for the experience then
than I actually miss her.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:10%
That's where my heart is.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.920 align:middle line:10%
While we're talking about
Kim, can I show you this?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.920 align:middle line:10%
She gave me this a couple
of days before I left.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
It says, my hero, because I'm
getting back on the bike after

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I more or less swore up
and down that I wouldn't.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:90%
And she encouraged me to do it.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so I am her hero.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:19.820 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>> At this point, we're still
150 kilometers from Rishikesh.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:84%
We're running out of
light and encountering

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.475 align:middle line:90%
some interesting traffic.

00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.522 align:middle line:10%
>> There was a crossroads and I
ended up taking the upper road,

00:14:36.522 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:10%
because it looked like
the most traveled,

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.160 align:middle line:10%
so I thought that
was the right road.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.640 align:middle line:84%
0.5 kilometers, boom,
the tire blew out.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Pretty bad blow out.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was
one of those bang.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.143 align:middle line:90%
And the tire went flat.

00:14:48.143 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, it was
managed to get the bike

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:50.852 align:middle line:90%
off the side of the road.

00:14:50.852 --> 00:14:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So I guess, yeah,
good thing if I

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.237 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have had a
blow out I. Probably

00:14:54.237 --> 00:14:56.740 align:middle line:84%
would have went who knows
how far before I realized

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:84%
I was going in the
wrong direction.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.065 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, within 10
minutes, the mechanic

00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
came along right
behind me and he

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
had the tire off
and five minutes,

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
put it on the back of
his bike, and took off.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> As night starts to set in,
these roads get even crazier.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The winding truck-filled
sheer cliffs

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:84%
now become a sea of
blackness with blinding

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.200 align:middle line:84%
white lights and no idea
of where the edges are.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I decide to pull over
wondering if we should just

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
stop, regroup, and maybe stay
overnight rather than risk

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
driving for hours and
hours in the dark.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is Ryan and
Anand are somewhere up ahead

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.623 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.623 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's pretty spooky when
the truck's coming at you

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and whatnot.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Not many railings
up around in there.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:90%
And there's cars too wide.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.948 align:middle line:84%
There's trucks that they're
pushing me off the road.

00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you've
got to be right there.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And just the way the
truck lights come forward,

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.550 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of blinding.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:90%
You don't see for a minute.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Really if it wasn't for
Ana, she was like a rock.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
She just kept telling me,
you know, it's all right.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:90%
Take your time.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:90%
We're going to get there.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.438 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I should
have stopped, but I

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to be the only
guy that didn't show up here

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.530 align:middle line:90%
last night.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:33.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Evolution in its very
nature is discontinuous,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
meaning that has to come a point
where whatever exists ceases

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
to exist the way it has
for however long it has.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.315 align:middle line:84%
There has to be a
total quantum leap.

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we are
really coming together

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
for that quantum leap
can only occur right

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.030 align:middle line:84%
now in this very
moment where you said,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:84%
you know what, that's
what's going to happen.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
And then every
part of your being

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
supports you in the
follow through of that.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.457 align:middle line:84%
The mind will come back and try
and interfere after a while.

00:17:06.457 --> 00:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's what we have to
be vigilant and aware to keep

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:09.956 align:middle line:90%
the continuity.

00:17:09.956 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Again, the mind will start
using whatever we have developed

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:90%
as an escape mechanism.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:84%
For instance, whatever
it is, the mind

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle line:84%
will start using it as
an escape mechanism.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you, again, still have
to create, again, quantum leap.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
creates a radically

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.450 align:middle line:84%
alive, passionate,
compassionate life, you see.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're
simply vegetating

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where
the most important part

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.520 align:middle line:84%
of our growth and our
evolution as individuals

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and as a community and society.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what, for me, has
been one of the great practice

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%
is that in the moment.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, where do I need
to leap right now?

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.795 align:middle line:84%
Not because of waiting,
oh, when that will happen,

00:17:54.795 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
or when will I have more money,
or when will I have that,

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.330 align:middle line:84%
and when the weather
will be better.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:02.120 align:middle line:84%
No, you decide right
now what needs to leap.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So last night, I made a
decision we'd keep the group

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.140 align:middle line:90%
at the hotel.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.825 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want to
risk riding at night

00:18:19.825 --> 00:18:20.950 align:middle line:90%
on these treacherous roads.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely
was a small window

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:90%
to see what it's like to lead.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think Anand
created that on purpose.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
But as a teacher, I'd
say he definitely lets

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:90%
experience do the teachings.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
He allows for opportunities
and for windows for me

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.960 align:middle line:90%
to see what it entails to lead.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We've all dealt with
circumstances on this trip

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.837 align:middle line:84%
going beyond the
previous circumstances.

00:18:45.837 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's also important
then to take it a step further

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.207 align:middle line:84%
and say, how can I
add to the situation?

00:18:51.207 --> 00:18:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just, OK,
how can I be free now,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.185 align:middle line:84%
how can I add to what's
going on around me?

00:18:56.185 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Keep that presence,
which Anand started

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.143 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, the valley of
flowers and a lot of people

00:19:00.143 --> 00:19:02.670 align:middle line:90%
not being leaders.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
So we appreciate everyone
doing that, holding space.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.050 align:middle line:84%
We all held space last
night for Mark get back safe

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanic stepped
up and helped him out tons.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So that was sweet.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the biggest fear for
me was the transformation that

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I was going to go through and
I am going to, because change

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:90%
of life is scary.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's like
crossroads in my life.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I haven't yet come
to a decision.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Whatever is going to
happen will happen.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the universe
takes care of you

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.853 align:middle line:84%
and leads you in
the right direction.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> With 70 kilometers
ahead of us this morning,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing just how washed out
some of these roads really are.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And imagining riding
them last night,

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
tired, blinded by
lights, I'm just

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:84%
incredibly happy that Ryan
and Anand made it back safely

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:90%
to Rishikesh.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Because even in daylight,
we witnessed a near death

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're definitely focused
for this last leg of riding,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.160 align:middle line:84%
while back in Rishikesh, Ryan is
focused on helping Ana take out

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.140 align:middle line:84%
the stitches from when she
knocked her head on a rock

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:18.940 align:middle line:90%
a week ago.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we're all realizing
how many close calls we've had

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:84%
throughout this whole journey
and how protected we've been,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
kind of this crazy grace
on a trip like this.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:22:36.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
As we arrive home
in Rishikesh, we

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
take time to dip into the
sacred waters of the Ganga.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But we, of course, remember
the warnings Anand has given us

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of the trip.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:10%
>> So they got super
excited, they think it's a--

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.922 align:middle line:10%
it becomes part of a
religious thing, right?

00:22:54.922 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:10%
So they go and the
dip and they get

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.380 align:middle line:10%
so excited that they are
in the Ganga, you know,

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.220 align:middle line:10%
which is the
epitome of Hinduism.

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.090 align:middle line:10%
And then the mother
takes them and then

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:10%
she's not a mother anymore.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.400 align:middle line:10%
She's a witch.

>> The Ganga still raging
with the force of monsoons.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But thankfully, the group
finds a nice safe place

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to dip and have a
lighthearted splash.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Anand, ever the
adventurer, has decided

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.090 align:middle line:84%
to take some of the group up
the river looking for a place

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.030 align:middle line:84%
to swim across this
still incredibly fast

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and raging Ganga River.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.955 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, he finds
himself a nice little surprise.

00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:24:25.206 --> 00:24:26.936 align:middle line:10%
>> Ryan, does your
heart beat faster?

00:24:26.936 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:10%
>> A little bit.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:10%
I don't remember.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.255 align:middle line:10%

Just do it.

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:45.520 align:middle line:10%
Don't do it if you
don't feel like it.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:10%

And I said to myself
45 seconds before it

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:84%
happened, Jeff's getting
tired of dicking around.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.250 align:middle line:90%
He's just going to go.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.877 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

the first one that will fucking

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:90%
do it.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And then Mario
and those guys.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.165 align:middle line:84%
And I watched the whole thing

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.810 align:middle line:84%
I saw Jeff and Adam both
get taken into that eddy.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And Jeff started to have a
little bit of a panic session.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And I saw him go under
a couple of times.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.015 align:middle line:84%
And I was really starting
to panic, you know.

And having only known
these guys a short time,

00:25:31.242 --> 00:25:32.200 align:middle line:90%
it seems kind of weird.
