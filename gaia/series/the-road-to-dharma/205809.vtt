What you are doing
is when you're

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:84%
offer this symbolic of that
you are offering your inner--

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:27.230 align:middle line:84%
your singular light into
the universal light.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So you are merging
into the infinite.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.693 align:middle line:90%
So that's the symbol.

00:17:30.693 --> 00:17:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're offering your light
is really you're tuning in.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.485 align:middle line:84%
You're tuning in
with the source,

00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:36.830 align:middle line:84%

that your light--

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
this light in your hand becomes
symbolic of your inner self

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%

and Ryan will also leave behind
the comforts of his wife Kim.

>> I think that when we
get into relationships,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:10%
oftentimes we just load
the other person down with

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.700 align:middle line:10%
expectations and we take away
their freedom a lot of times.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think that if
you really, really

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:84%
want to honor your
partner and if you really

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:84%
want to be of service to
your partner and service

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:84%
to your relationship, then
you give them freedom.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You give them absolute freedom
like this trip for Ryan.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like I
gave him permission to go,

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%

place where there's

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
such a deep sense of
trust and commitment

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
there that when you
really, really know that

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and really, really feel
that, you will do just about

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:90%
anything for your partner.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
whether it's telling

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.280 align:middle line:84%
them to take a trip
like this without you

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's getting them a
cup of coffee unbegrudgingly,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
it's just doing
things unbegrudgingly

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and because you
truly, truly want to.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just-- you've
got to give them freedom.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:90%
You've got to give them space.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:90%
You've got to give them love.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:90%
You've got to give them time.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And you've got to mean it all.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't be half-assed
about your service.

of his bike to look out for him
or see the signs of a seizure.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.883 align:middle line:10%
>> I get a little bit confused
and I have some trouble talking

00:19:53.883 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that, but you'd
never know that on the bike

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:10%
and I wouldn't either.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And then there has been
periods of like 20 minutes

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that I don't even remember
beforehand, you know?

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:90%
And I'm perfectly normal, so--

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Come out of it.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and then all of a
sudden I'm like, you know--

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't necessarily want to
be responsible for something

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.565 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm on the medication.

00:20:14.565 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that spooks me
the most about having somebody

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.402 align:middle line:84%
on the back is, you know, I know
I will not tense up on a bike,

00:20:20.402 --> 00:20:22.110 align:middle line:84%
but if somebody is on
the back and you're

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
like this thing on
my back, you know,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.713 align:middle line:84%
you've got to not
only self-correct

00:20:26.713 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:84%
but you've got to correct for
somebody else who's throwing

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.172 align:middle line:90%
your weight a little bit.

00:20:30.172 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you go, Well, that makes me
a little bit nervous sometimes.

about having a passenger

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and the passengers equally
concerned about trusting

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
their rider, Kim steps in before
leaving to give the ladies one

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:90%
last bit of advice.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If the bike starts to go
down, don't put your feet down.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Try and get your hands on the
seat and push yourself away.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:10%
Like push yourself
away from your rider

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:10%
so you don't end
up under the bike.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you're getting a
little scared or freaked out,

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
remember what they said about
the love conquering fear?

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I get into a corner
that I'm a little sketched

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I just love, love,
love, love, love.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.293 align:middle line:90%
Just put it out there.

00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't feel
like you're feeling it,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
if you're saying it
it's somewhere in there.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Try really, really
hard not to be nervous,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:90%
to just kind of hand it over.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you get
nervous on there

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.385 align:middle line:84%
and you're doing
this to your rider,

00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be nervous
about having you on the back,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and there's a very good
chance they might say, please

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:90%
get off my bike.

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.070 align:middle line:84%
They're all going to
take good care of you.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.350 align:middle line:84%
They really are going to
take great care of you.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So just be mindful, don't
freak out, go with it,

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:90%
and come back safe, OK?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.335 align:middle line:90%

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And suddenly the mood
changed as Ryan couldn't find

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:90%
the seizure medication.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:20.495 align:middle line:90%
No one could find his bag.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:90%
I hear you.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And like Anand said,
we're going to the area where

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
the cloudburst happened three
days ago causing a massive

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:40.330 align:middle line:84%
landslide killing 31 people, so
everyone definitely wants to be

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.550 align:middle line:90%
fully focused and ready.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So we'll look.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.350 align:middle line:90%
You don't know anything yet.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And as you go up and
look, and if it's not here,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
you'll get it.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.190 align:middle line:90%
So there's no reason to worry.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Those tires are going
to be OK in the rain?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:10%
They're bald.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:10%
The tires are pretty bald.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The road is semi
wet so be careful.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.150 align:middle line:90%
When it's semi wet.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.108 align:middle line:90%
It's the most slippery.

00:27:19.108 --> 00:27:21.978 align:middle line:90%

>> You can see it.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.250 align:middle line:90%
The rain starts coming in.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking up and I'm like,
that sun is going down.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know we're
40 kilometers away.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, we're
hitting dark very soon.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.300 align:middle line:84%
We hit more rain and
then there's lightning

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:84%
and now there's
lights coming at us.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:90%


00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.060 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.446 align:middle line:10%
We were just--

00:28:12.446 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:10%
I was just going in
and out of puddles

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:10%
not knowing what
you're going into.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Still dodging cars, still
dodging lights, still

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.120 align:middle line:84%
doing everything you would do
when it's not pouring rain,

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.187 align:middle line:90%
and it was ridiculous.

00:28:25.187 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.633 align:middle line:84%
>> I saw a guy on a scooter
that had nothing to do with me.

00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I just happened
to be passing him.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:90%
That's when I was raining.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And he lost it in the
water and his handlebar

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.247 align:middle line:84%
turned right around--
two guys again--

00:28:41.247 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and he went right
over the handlebars.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
happened to the other guy

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.490 align:middle line:84%
because it was
starting to get dark.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.938 align:middle line:84%
But again, I wanted to stop
and see how he was bad.

00:28:47.938 --> 00:28:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to lose
whoever it was in front of me

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:51.030 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:29:00.370 align:middle line:90%

>> Still 10 kilometers from our
destination we stop to regroup.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:12.150 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing people go down and
Ryan still can't find his meds.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.350 align:middle line:84%
The reality of this
journey is literally

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.595 align:middle line:90%
hitting us in the face.

00:29:15.595 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:90%
And the mental game?

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:90%
It's on.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Do we stop, or do we keep going?

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Strange enough, the
riders' attitudes

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:43.050 align:middle line:84%
seemed light and optimistic,
or maybe we're just all

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:90%
starting to lose our minds.

00:29:50.078 --> 00:29:52.370 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to fix that
light and then we'll move.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The cars will lead us
and then we'll follow.

anything in this light.

As is the world and the
reality of it in us,

that's how the
world comes to us.

that is the experience.

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's some profound
distinction we have to realize.

If we don't realize that,
we always live as a victim.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We live with the mentality
of me against the world.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.030 align:middle line:90%
It's me against the whole.

It's me against my life.
