The journey continues
to Badrinath.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where mystical yogis

has signaled a warning

with already Mario,
Jen, and Fred injured.

And from what we saw of
the riding ability of Elle

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and Fred, one
wouldn't expect them

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to get very far on this road
without accident, injury,

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.985 align:middle line:90%
or having to be sent home.

the way human beings
thought it would,

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.960 align:middle line:90%

falling off the edges,

you walked far enough,

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.354 align:middle line:84%
you would fall off
the edge of the Earth.

right around, two guys, again.
