>> Hello, I'm Reece Jones,
and welcome to module 1,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.075 align:middle line:90%
Scaling the Recall Ladder.

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:30.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.960 align:middle line:84%
We all dream every night,
whether we remember or not.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
However, experiencing dreaming
and remembering dreaming

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:90%
are two very different things.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Thus, in order to start bringing
back these experiences intact,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.642 align:middle line:84%
it's critical to instill
some foundational practices,

00:00:55.642 --> 00:00:59.050 align:middle line:84%
practices which, as
you'll quickly discover,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.020 align:middle line:84%
everything else is
built on top of.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:90%
And so let's get straight to it.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, you need
to make a pledge to yourself

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
to start remembering your dreams
from this moment on, an earnest

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and serious pledge.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.170 align:middle line:84%
That might sound like
laughably simple advice,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
but you'd be surprised how
far this little tidbit can go.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
By actively turning your
attention towards your dreams,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
you're sending a strong
signal to yourself.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I want to start
remembering my dreams.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And so the process
begins, slow at first,

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:90%
but in time gaining momentum.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to start
remembering my dreams.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Remind yourself of this simple
wish throughout the day.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, come evening, as
you're falling to sleep,

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
repeat this wish to yourself
again and again, silently

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%
within your mind.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.646 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It's also advised to go
to sleep in a sober state

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%
as much as you can.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
While certain drugs,
entheogens in particular,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
can enhance dreaming,
at least temporarily,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
it's ill advised for
long-term success.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you want
your mind to be clear,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
so that your dreams
and your memory of them

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:90%
can blossom unimpeded.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
In a similar vein,
you should also

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
consider taking up meditation,
preferably just before bed.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This will further
sharpen your mind

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and clear the space for strong
recall the following morning.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be a long session.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
5, 10, or 15 minutes
will suffice.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you should worry less
about the length of the session

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and more about the consistency.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
If you maintain this consistency
over a multiple-day period,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.980 align:middle line:84%
you should notice your
dream memories slowly

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.865 align:middle line:90%
coming into focus.

And, of course before
getting into bed,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
make sure you have all the
requisite tools close by--

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
a dream journal and
a pen, for example.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:84%
The last thing you
want is to be searching

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:90%
for these upon awakening.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So keep all of it on
your bedside cabinet

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.385 align:middle line:90%
ready and waiting to go.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The specific tools
you'll use to log with

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.680 align:middle line:90%
will be up to you, of course.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Some people log on their phones
using the virtual keyboard

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.830 align:middle line:90%
and notepad app.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Some write on a tablet
with a digital pen.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Some use a voice recorder.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Others stay traditional and
just use a pen and a journal.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.210 align:middle line:90%
Personally, I use a mix.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
I write rough notes on a
whiteboard during the night.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I do so in the dark, so I
don't have to turn on lights

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
and disturb my melatonin levels.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Then I transfer the notes over
to a full log on a tablet,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.063 align:middle line:84%
using a digital
pen come morning.

00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
The option that
works best for you

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.820 align:middle line:84%
will be dependent
on the environment

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
you sleep in and
whether or not you

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
share that environment
with anyone else.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So experiment and find
what works best for you.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump ahead now and
pretend it's morning.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.660 align:middle line:90%
You meditated just before sleep.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.090 align:middle line:90%
You got into bed sober.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
You repeated the
mantra tonight I'll

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
remember my dreams silently
in your mind whilst falling

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to sleep.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Your dream journal and pen was
placed on your bedside cabinet.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:90%
And now you're waking up in bed.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The first thing to remember
here is stay still.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
This might sound strange,
but moving too suddenly

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
can wipe your recall, especially
when you're just starting out.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
So instead, stay still in
the exact same position

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
you woke up in, and start
trawling through your memories.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember anything?

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you do, and it
just starts flowing.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
In which case, perfect.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Let it flow.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%
But if it doesn't, that's OK.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Just gently send
out some probes.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, you can ask
yourself, where was I just now

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and see if your brain responds.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, you
can play a little game

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
with yourself I like to
call alphabetic recall.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
Start by thinking of something
beginning with the letter

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.530 align:middle line:90%
A. What comes to mind?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Apple maybe?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Arrow perhaps?

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And do those words
spark anything for you?

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Do they connect up to anything
that happened in your dreams

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:90%
last night?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
If not, that's fine.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Move on and think of something
beginning with the letter

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.000 align:middle line:84%
B. What comes to mind
for that, and does it

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:84%
spark anything for you that
happened in your dreams

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:90%
last night?

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
If this technique works and
you latch onto a memory,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
now tease out the details using
the reverse memory technique.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So whatever you recall, ask
yourself what led to that.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, what
happened just before it?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.300 align:middle line:84%
That will often
spark another memory,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and then you do
the same with that.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
What led to that
situation, and so on.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
If you're gentle with
yourself and don't probe too

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
aggressively, you can gently
tease out many details

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
with this simple
technique alone.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
If still no details
emerge, try this.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.530 align:middle line:84%
It's similar in nature to
the previous technique,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:90%
but slightly different.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Try to imagine some
different scenarios

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.520 align:middle line:90%
you might have dreamt about.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, it's
likely you dreamed

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.910 align:middle line:84%
about your wife, or husband,
or perhaps a friend.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
These are all people
you see and think

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
about a lot in your waking
life, so the chances

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.010 align:middle line:84%
of you dreaming
about them are high.

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:90%
Does that spark anything?

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:90%
If not, keep going.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Think of some likely
environments you dreamt of.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe
you dreamt about one

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of your favorite parks
or your family home.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are
spots you frequent

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
a lot, so the chances you
dreamed about them are high.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
By continuing to
probe in this manner,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:84%
eventually you will
stumble upon a memory.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And from there, just like
before, you can tease out

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.145 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the details with
the reverse memory technique.

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:48.795 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:50.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now you have
some recall, and you can

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:90%
start logging in your journal.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:90%
But is that it?

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, not quite.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.750 align:middle line:84%
As you go about
your day, I want you

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to continue keeping your
eyes out for recall,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and have a way to log that
recall when it emerges.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.790 align:middle line:90%
I call these recall triggers.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.620 align:middle line:90%
We've all experienced them--

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
someone says something
or you see something

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:90%
that reminds you of a dream.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Most people just let these
moments pass them by.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
The memory briefly
surges, and then it's

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:90%
forgotten about again.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
