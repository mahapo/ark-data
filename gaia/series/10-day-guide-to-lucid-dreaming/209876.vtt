>>REECE JONES: Hello,
I'm Reece Jones,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and welcome to module 9--

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.845 align:middle line:84%
Passing Meaning
from Your Dreams.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.960 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're having memorable
and long lasting lucid dreams,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll describe to
you how to extract

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
meaning from them upon awakening
and integrate that meaning

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.365 align:middle line:90%
into your waking life.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
The world of dream
interpretation is a minefield.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is a cursory
glance over a new age bookshelf.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that there are a
plethora of books, mainly dream

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
dictionaries, that
claim to reveal

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
the meanings behind your
dreams by simply flipping

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
to the relevant page and
reading out the explanation.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Whilst conceptually this
is quite a nice idea,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
easy and effortless, in practice
they're as close to useless

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.360 align:middle line:90%
as you can get.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't be fooled by
the oversimplification

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and homogenisation
of such books.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
They are not your
friends and, ultimately,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
will not aid you in the same
way that personal interpretation

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Granted there are some
general dream themes

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
that can be ascribed some
overarching universal meanings.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
But they are low
resolution interpretations.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So all things
considered, they're

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
not particularly useful.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you routinely
dream of natural disasters,

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
it's not too much
of a stretch to say

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.190 align:middle line:84%
you might have
anxiety around events

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
that you perceive as
out of your control.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
But that interpretation
hardly goes

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
far towards meaningful,
personal growth and healing.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a vague clue
but nothing more.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And the clue might, ultimately,
be way off the mark,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
depending on your
own personal story

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and what you
subjectively associate

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.170 align:middle line:90%
with natural disasters.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
With that in mind
then, if you insist

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
on using some sort
of dream dictionary

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.640 align:middle line:84%
to interpret your
dreams, it should

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.320 align:middle line:90%
be a personally curated one.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.110 align:middle line:84%
You can go about this
by simply writing down

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.010 align:middle line:84%
associations you think of when
imagining a particular theme.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, what do
dogs conjure up for you?

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.210 align:middle line:90%
As in how do they make you feel?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And what connections
spark in your mind

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:90%
when you think of them?

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Cute maybe?

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Love perhaps?

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Responsibility?

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:90%
That's a start.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
So write all of
those things down.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And begin to log
them alphabetically.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Keep on doing this.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And you'll eventually have
your very own dream dictionary.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Even this isn't
foolproof, though,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
because life is a constantly
shifting kaleidoscope

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.230 align:middle line:90%
of feelings and emotions.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, dogs
might very well

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
mean all of those
things to you now.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But what about a
year down the line?

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
Will they still represent
the same things?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps not.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you got bitten by a dog
in the interim, for example.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
If so, redo the exercise.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And see what you write down now.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.490 align:middle line:90%
Fear maybe?

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Unsafe perhaps?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Pain?

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Even keeping your personal dream
dictionary updated like this

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.300 align:middle line:84%
is relatively low
resolution, though,

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
because the conscious
connections you make whilst

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
awake might not be the same
subconscious connections

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%
you make whilst you dream.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's
probably safe to say

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.109 align:middle line:84%
there's only a weak
connection between the two.

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And so as you can see, even
with a personally curated dream

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.150 align:middle line:84%
dictionary, there's something
inherently unreliable

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%
about them.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:90%
What to do then?

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Is there a better,
more reliable way

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
to extract meaning
from your dreams?

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's nowhere near as
complicated as people make out.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, I'd suggest
avoiding reading

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.850 align:middle line:84%
too much into the symbology
behind your dreams.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Whilst I don't doubt
it's sometimes present,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.800 align:middle line:84%
it can be quite
hard to decipher.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're once again
opening yourself up

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:90%
to potential misinterpretation.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you should
simply do this.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Upon awakening, when
jotting down your dreams,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.470 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the page,
write down your strong lingering

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, you might write
down anxious and upset.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
If so, it seems safe
to assert that there's

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
something either consciously
or subconsciously playing

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.325 align:middle line:84%
on your mind there, something
that's worthy of exploration

00:05:35.325 --> 00:05:36.125 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You should also take note
of any strong lingering

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
imagery or anything that stood
out to you as particularly

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:90%
strange or unique.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Then see if you can
figure out the connections

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is making
between its experience

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, waking, and its
experimental knowledge,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.600 align:middle line:90%
dreaming.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe you dreamed
of an old childhood friend

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.700 align:middle line:90%
as your college professor.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
What has your brain done
there, do you think?

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:84%
It's merging two
different worlds.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, on some
level, maybe you've

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
always thought of your old
friend as wise and teacherly.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And only now is your
brain getting around

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
to experimenting more deeply
with that thought, playing it

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:90%
out in real time.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
If so, explore the thought
further once awake,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:84%
and see what feeling
it leaves you with.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The lingering
feelings are always

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.935 align:middle line:84%
the key to unlocking the greater
meaning behind your dreams.

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
Don't automatically ascribe
a searing importance

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:90%
to any of this, though.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Overanalyzation is real.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you're hell bent on
finding meaning in everything,

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
you're going to drive yourself
insane in the process.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:90%
So try this instead.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Only go deep on interpretation
if the dream is recurring.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
have a dream about being

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.660 align:middle line:84%
in an out of control
car and you wake up

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:84%
with strong feelings of fear
and anxiety, jot it down.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:90%
And move on.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
However, if you keep
on having dreams

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
about being in an
out-of-control car

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and you continue waking up
with strong feelings of fear

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety, now is the
time to stop and listen.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
What is the dream
demonstrating here?

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
The fact it's recurring
suggests it's not

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
some fleeting random series of
images cooked up by the brain,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
sorting through
memories of the day.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Instead it suggests
something bigger,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:84%
something that's left an
imprint on your psyche somehow.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And now's the time
to do some digging.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:90%
Could it be literal?

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:90%
Quite possibly.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.690 align:middle line:84%
As I said earlier, I
wouldn't automatically

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
presume your dream is
talking exclusively

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
in symbols and metaphors.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It does seem to at
times but not always.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you're dreaming of
being in an out-of-control car

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
simply because you're
scared of cars.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you were in a car
crash when you were younger.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's traumatized you.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case, I
suggest referring back

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:84%
to the previous module
and experimenting

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
with some exposure therapy.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Train yourself to recognize
out-of-control cars

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.130 align:middle line:90%
as a dream sign.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.710 align:middle line:90%
Get lucid when it next happens.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And integrate the fear by
repeated lucid exposure to it.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there is
some symbolism at play.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you keep on dreaming
about out-of-control cars

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
because you hate the thought
of being out of control

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:90%
in your waking life.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're overly
orderly and organized.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And you like to have
as much of your life

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
under your own personal
control as possible,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:90%
which is fine up to a point.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the dream is
displaying a subconscious

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:84%
desire to loosen its
grip on the wheel.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's demonstrating to
itself that regardless of how

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
much it tries to control
every last aspect of life,

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.120 align:middle line:84%
there will always be certain
things that cannot be foreseen

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:90%
or accounted for.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So if that's your takeaway,
write down your thoughts.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:90%
And sit with them.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Listen to them.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Mull them over.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
And return to the dream over
the coming days and weeks

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
to see if your
feelings change at all.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:13.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:84%
However, all of
these techniques pale

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
in comparison to
interpreting the dream

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:90%
whilst inside the dream itself.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
When lucid, you can evaluate in
real time how specific events

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
are making you
feel and experiment

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.330 align:middle line:84%
with different approaches
to integrate those feelings.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to look
back on them in retrospect.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.790 align:middle line:84%
You can take note of
the details as they

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
happen, which make for much
more convincing litmus tests.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can even experiment
with talking to the dream

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:56.040 align:middle line:84%
directly, asking what it's
trying to impart, if anything.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon to
receive a literal response

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
from a narrated dream
voice when you do this.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And whilst I'd be hesitant to
believe what the voice says

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.380 align:middle line:84%
without question, it's another
useful tidbit of information

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:84%
to log upon awakening
and mull over

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:90%
in the coming days and weeks.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps it's nonsense.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.775 align:middle line:84%
But then again,
perhaps it's not.

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
The biggest takeaway here is
to be your own interpreter.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Don't rely on others to
interpret your dreams for you.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Believe that you'll get
to the bottom of things.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And given the right time,
effort, and dedication,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:90%
you will.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
