00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:28.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REECE JONES: Hello, I'm Reece
Jones, and welcome to Module 7,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.295 align:middle line:10%
What to Expect.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:10%
In this module, I'll describe
what a typical lucid dream

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:10%
looks and feels like.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And how with this knowledge,
you can prepare yourself

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
for the inevitable
rush of excitement

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
you'll feel upon first
gaining lucidity.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.280 align:middle line:10%
How to modulate your
emotions from there.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, how to
stabilize and extend

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.085 align:middle line:90%
the length of your lucid dream.

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:10%
All sorts of things can happen
upon first gaining lucidity.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:10%
The spectrum ranges from
a full-scale explosion

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.610 align:middle line:10%
of awareness, followed by
total control of the dream

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.900 align:middle line:10%
environment, all the way
to instantly waking up

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:10%
and the lucid dream ending.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:10%
This is a big spectrum and
many nuanced experiences

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.995 align:middle line:10%
lie in between both extremes.

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:36.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
First, let's look at the
waking up end of the spectrum.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:10%
Why does this happen,
and how do you stop it?

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, rest assured if
you experience this,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.380 align:middle line:10%
you're not alone.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:10%
This is a common occurrence
with newer lucid dreamers,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.650 align:middle line:10%
and usually happens
because of essentially

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:10%
unfettered excitement.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:10%
The realization
that you're dreaming

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:10%
is just so mind-blowing,
so earth shattering,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:10%
that you blow open the
doors between waking

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:10%
life and dreaming life and
re-emerge into your bed

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:10%
at home.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:10%


00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:10%
While this can be extremely
frustrating the first few times

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:10%
you experience it,
don't be disheartened.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:84%
There's an important lesson
to be learned here effectively

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.235 align:middle line:90%
modulating your emotions.

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Just like in waking
life, learning

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to modulate your emotions is
a very useful tool to have.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:10%
And you can do it
just like this.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:10%
Take a deep breath in and out.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.145 align:middle line:84%
Now, get walking and
continue breathing deep.

00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:10%
Feel the dream environment as
you walk around it, the walls,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.830 align:middle line:10%
your hands, any furniture.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:10%
Appreciate what you're
experiencing and feel

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:10%
gratitude for it, but
don't let your thoughts

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:10%
get away from you.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Stay centered and
continue breathing deep.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:10%
Say out loud to yourself,
I'm lucid dreaming

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:10%
and I'm prepared.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm lucid dreaming
and I'm prepared.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, notice how your
heart rate is lowering

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:10%
and your mind is focusing.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Similar to a meditation,
allow yourself to really soak

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:10%
in all the sensory stimuli here
engaging calmly, but directly

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:10%
with the dream.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Doing all of this will
sharpen the visuals

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and help you stay lucid
for prolonged periods.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You can even practice
this in waking life.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:10%
At interim moments
throughout your waking day,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.780 align:middle line:10%
perform a reality check.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:10%
And as you do, regardless
of the confirmation

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.050 align:middle line:10%
that you are indeed
in waking life,

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.280 align:middle line:10%
role play what it would feel
like to receive a dreaming life

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:10%
confirmation instead.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:10%
In other words, pretend you're
dreaming, take it all in,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:10%
feel the all, soak
in the science,

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:10%
practice the grounding protocol.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Go through the whole
thing just like a drill.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:10%
And the more you do this,
the more used to the idea

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.605 align:middle line:10%
of lucidity you'll become.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It's also important to underline
how critical movement is

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:90%
within a lucid dream.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Without it, things typically
break down quickly.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.060 align:middle line:10%
So with that in mind, try
not to linger in any one spot

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:10%
for too long.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:10%
If you want to stay exploring
one specific room, that's fine,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:10%
you can do that, but keep
moving around it as you do.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.570 align:middle line:10%
If you want to inspect one
specific object for a prolonged

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.920 align:middle line:10%
period, that's fine too but
keep your eyes moving over it

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.560 align:middle line:10%
as you do.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:10%
For me, the dream
begins to break down

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:10%
if I don't offer it some sort
of input for more than about

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:10%
five seconds.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So keep that general
rule in mind.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:10%
For the ride to
keep going, you need

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:10%
to continue rolling
along its tracks.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
If the call stops, you'll
often find yourself ejected

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:90%
from the ride prematurely.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
But you might wonder,
when I get lucid,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:90%
what will it actually look like?

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Well, again, this is
a spectrum ranging

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.810 align:middle line:10%
from grainy, unstable,
and colorless, all the way

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:10%
to vivid, ultra HD, and
more real than real.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Again, this vividness can
be startling to the psyche

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:10%
and cause you to wake
up if you're unprepared.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
So be aware of the potential.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And what do you do
if you find yourself

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:10%
lucid in an unrealistic-looking
environment?

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps everything's
fuzzy and black and white.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, they should naturally
happen less and less

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:10%
the more experienced you
become, but until then, you

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:10%
can employ what I call
assertion techniques, which

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:10%
is exactly what it sounds like.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:10%
Be upfront with the dream.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:10%
Tell it what you want.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.760 align:middle line:10%
And as you tell it,
believe you have the power

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:10%
to change the environment
because you do.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:10%
In practice, this could be as
simple as saying more color now

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:10%
or less blurriness now.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.430 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple technique,
but you'll be surprised

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:90%
how often it works.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:10%
So let's move forward now.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
So you're lucid, you've
successfully grounded the scene

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're now 15 minutes
deep into the experience.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:10%
Have you locked in
lucidity permanently?

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, perhaps it's
wise not to assume so.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:20.570 align:middle line:10%
In fact, lucidity is known to
wane over time, either because

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
of dream characters trying to
distract you with plot elements

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:10%
or simply from a
fading awareness.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:10%
But don't worry, there
are ways to stop this too.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.340 align:middle line:10%
Firstly, don't be afraid
to ignore a dream character

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:10%
if you have a plan
in place and they're

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:10%
trying to waylay you from it.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:10%
It's OK to stay focused and
not let them lead you away.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:10%
Or if you do decide to go
ahead and follow their lead,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:10%
that's fine, but make sure to
intermittently remind yourself

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:10%
where you are and
what you're doing.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:10%
You can do this in a whole
host of different ways,

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.740 align:middle line:10%
including follow-up
reality checks

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:10%
or by simply speaking
out loud to yourself.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.280 align:middle line:10%
Remember I'm dreaming,
don't forget.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember I'm dreaming,
don't forget.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Finally, know that
sometimes the dream imagery

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.220 align:middle line:10%
will fade without the
lucid dream actually coming

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.210 align:middle line:10%
to an end.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:30.010 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
You can find yourself
in what essentially

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.820 align:middle line:84%
amounts to a void area
without actually waking up.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.280 align:middle line:10%
This is an
interesting phenomenon

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:10%
and can be especially
confusing for beginners

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:10%
because the vast majority
of your dream senses

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:10%
are stripped away from you.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:10%
And so everything is saying
this is the end of the dream yet

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:10%
somehow you're still
inside the dream.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.980 align:middle line:10%
When you find yourself
in these areas,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:10%
the only sense that
usually remains--

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.210 align:middle line:10%
for me at least--

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.840 align:middle line:10%
is touch.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:10%
So as a way to stay
focused and not

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:10%
drift back into
non-lucidity, I like

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:10%
to keep myself active and
aware by feeling my way

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:10%
around the dark environment.

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.180 align:middle line:10%
Even though there's
nothing to see,

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:22.960 align:middle line:10%
there should still
be things to feel.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:10%
So don't give up
whilst in this space
