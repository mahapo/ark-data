00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm Reece Jones, and welcome
to module 6, Planning

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.840 align:middle line:90%
for Lucidity.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have a better idea
of how to induce a lucid dream,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
it's time to create a
blueprint for your next one.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Without a specific
plan in place,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreams are often short
lived and directionless.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So planning a general
framework for your next one

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
will help you
sidestep this pitfall.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.750 align:middle line:90%
But how to do it.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way you
approach this is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:84%
going to depend on the
sort of person you are

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and what exactly you're looking
to get out of lucid dreaming.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
might just be looking

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to have some fun with
it, in which case,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.790 align:middle line:84%
maybe you want to explore
a futuristic theme park

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.620 align:middle line:84%
or tour the mansions
of the Hollywood Hills.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you're here for more
serious psychological work,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
in which case, a
lucid dream meditation

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
could be perfect for you or
exploring a traumatic memory

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:90%
from your distant past.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.885 align:middle line:84%
With lucid dreaming, all of
this and much more is possible.

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what
you end up choosing

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.720 align:middle line:84%
as your next lucid
dream adventure,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
the key takeaway
here is this, don't

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
make these important plans
inside the lucid dream itself.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Not only will it be a waste
of valuable dream time,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
but hanging around thinking
about what you want to do next

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
will risk dissolving the
dream and waking you up.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the
pressure of the moment,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
you might not be able to
think of anything at all.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Being on the spot like that
tends to freeze people.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, an easy
solution to all of this

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
is simply preparing
beforehand what exactly does

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:90%
preparation look like then?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, sit down with
a pen and paper

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and literally jot down a plan.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't just keep it as
thoughts in your head,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.940 align:middle line:84%
you want to solidify the plan
by writing it down on paper

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.842 align:middle line:84%
or typing it out,
whatever works for you.

00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
long, it could just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:90%
be a sentence or two.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But you want to get a
general outline in place.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.470 align:middle line:84%
An example might be
something like this.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.850 align:middle line:84%
In my next lucid
dream, I want to relive

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
a past traumatic
experience with my father.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I want to see it from
a fresh perspective

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.780 align:middle line:84%
and glean new insights
into what it meant

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.825 align:middle line:84%
and how it defined
the person I am today.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Granted this example
is quite intense

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:90%
and might not be for everyone.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So your example could
be something simpler

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.015 align:middle line:84%
and more lighthearted
like this, perhaps.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
In my next lucid dream,
I want to go flying.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And after I fly, I want
to experiment with running

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.584 align:middle line:90%
at supersonic speeds.

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:21.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
As you sit there writing
this, visualize it happening.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You're pulling on your
mild training here.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:84%
You're scripting what you
want the dream to look

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:84%
like, you're rehearsing
it in your mind's eye.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end,
you're reminding yourself

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.065 align:middle line:84%
that this will be
happening soon.

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
But what about if you
sit down to write a plan

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and nothing comes?

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's OK.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You just need to find
some inspiration.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can go and read what
other people have been up to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.090 align:middle line:90%
in their recent lucid dreams.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps, you could use your
own dream journal as reference.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember what I said in
module 2 about data extraction

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:90%
being a two-tiered process.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, when you log the
dreams upon awakening.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And then again, weeks
or months down the line

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:90%
when you read them back.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's an example of the
second tier of data extraction.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Read back through
your journal, find

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.250 align:middle line:90%
a dream that stands out to you.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Something you like
the framework of.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine what else
could have happened in it.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Re-imagine it and write it down.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.990 align:middle line:84%
This will be your
next lucid dream.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And whilst doing this, you might
even notice some dream signs

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that you hadn't noticed
the first time around.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.385 align:middle line:90%
If so, write those down too.

00:06:07.385 --> 00:06:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've got
something planned,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
we're ready for our
next lucid dream.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And you better believe
it's coming soon.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But what about if you can't
remember your plan once you're

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
inside the dream and lose it?

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's OK.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.110 align:middle line:84%
You just need to get
your memory going a bit.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.470 align:middle line:90%
So start with something easy.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
Recall your name, for example.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And then once you remember
your name, remember your age.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And then your address,
and then maybe your plan.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:90%
All the while, stay on the move.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't just stand there
thinking about it

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.890 align:middle line:84%
because the dream
might dissolve.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Instead, start walking, rubbing
your hands together as you go,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
looking around,
taking in the scene,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.575 align:middle line:90%
and exercising your memory.

00:07:19.575 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Before you know it, your
plan will return to you

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.550 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be ready
to manifest it.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
You may even notice
the vividness

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
of the scene increasing
the more you bring forth

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:90%
your waking life memories.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.345 align:middle line:84%
The two seem to be
intrinsically linked.

00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:84%
If you're still struggling to
recall the plan after all this,

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
however, then maybe you didn't
instill the memory deeply

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:90%
enough whilst in waking life.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:90%
If so, don't worry.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Back to the drawing
board and try again.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Upon awakening, make more
of a concerted effort

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to embed the plan in
your prospective memory.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So for example, keep the plan
on your person in your pocket,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, on a bit of paper.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And every couple of hours, pull
it out and read through it.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Stay consistent with this.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.789 align:middle line:90%
Do it again and again and again.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Do it right before bed
too and just after waking.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, with
enough practice,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
this plan will become so deeply
ingrained within your psyche

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
that you won't be able
to help but remember it

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.735 align:middle line:90%
during your next lucid dream.

00:08:50.735 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Upon returning from the
successful lucid dream where

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:84%
you manifested your plan, give
yourself a pat on the back.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%
You did it.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
It was no small
feat but you did it.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And so return to your writings
and tick it off the list.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.190 align:middle line:90%
Don't get complacent now though.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:84%
It's time to write down
your next lucid dream plan.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:84%
This time, maybe you
can even write down

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
a couple of different
ideas instead of just one.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you might
have a whole list

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:90%
you want to experiment with.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
But take it slow at first and
work up to the bigger things.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:84%
See what works, what doesn't,
and adjust your plans

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.190 align:middle line:90%
accordingly.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
This is an ongoing dance between
your conscious and unconscious

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
So don't be surprised if you
stumble upon some curiosities

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:90%
