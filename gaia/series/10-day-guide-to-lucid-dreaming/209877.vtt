00:00:16.368 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm Reece Jones.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to the 10th and
final module, "Breaking Down

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:90%
the Door."

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
By this point, I've given you
plenty of tools to work with,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
so you're likely
well on your way.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
people that are still

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
struggling to get things going?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're one of
those people, don't worry.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.040 align:middle line:90%
I haven't forgotten about you.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
In this module, I'm going
to cover some more forceful

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
techniques to help you break
down the door, as it were.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
Please note these
suggestions should

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.770 align:middle line:84%
be reserved as last resorts
and not experimented

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:90%
with willy-nilly.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, for those
that are still

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.320 align:middle line:84%
struggling with dream recall,
consider taking 240 milligrams

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin B6 just
before getting into bed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The research in this department
is far from conclusive,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:84%
but some studies do suggest this
can help kickstart your recall.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
I've experimented with it
a little bit over the years

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and can confirm there seems to
be some effect, however small.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So give it a go and take
note of the results.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't move
the needle, then we

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
need to experiment with
something a bit more extreme--

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
waking up in the night
during or just after REM.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
This is hardly a long-term
fix as it won't be

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:90%
good for your overall health.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
But if you're really struggling
to recall your dreams,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:84%
this might be just
what you need.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So experiment with something
I call "wee back to bed."

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:90%
The idea is simple.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Drink a good amount of water
just before getting into bed,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and your full bladder should
wake you up two or three

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
sleep cycles later
on to go and wee.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Then when you wake up,
use this as a chance

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to check in with
yourself for recall.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.480 align:middle line:84%
If all goes to plan, you should
wake up directly from a dream.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's the perfect
chance to practice.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.450 align:middle line:84%
You can even use this as
an opportunity to MILD.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But what about if a full
bladder doesn't wake you?

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, perhaps you
could experiment

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
with setting an alarm
to wake you instead.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be some
guesswork involved here

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to successfully target
the end of a REM cycle.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
But knowing that each
one is around 90 minutes

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and the last chunk of each
sleep cycle is a REM period,

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.680 align:middle line:84%
you can set your alarm
with an educated guess.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Try to target about
three sleep cycles deep,

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:84%
because the first two cycles
have minimal amounts of REM.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, just
before getting into bed,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.130 align:middle line:84%
set an alarm for
four-and-a-half hours time.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
I'd recommend using
a vibratory alarm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:middle line:84%
on the wrist in the
form of a smartwatch,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:84%
but auditory alarms
are an option too.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.090 align:middle line:84%
In the same way as the "wee
back to bed" technique,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
if all goes to plan, this
should wake you up directly

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
from a dream,
which will give you

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
a chance to stretch
your recall muscle

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:90%
and write some details down.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't wake
up directly from a dream,

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
this technique still
has a chance to work.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:90%
Do this for a few weeks.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of it, the
ball should be rolling.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
At which point,
you can revert back

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:90%
to your normal sleep schedule.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And I stress, please do revert
back as soon as you can.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Interrupting your sleep is
inherently bad for your health

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
and should only be
used as a last resort.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
But what about if your
problem isn't recall

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and it is instead a problem
with inducing lucidity itself?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Are there any supplements
that can help with that?

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, whilst nothing
can guarantee lucidity

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
100% of the time,
there are indeed

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
some supplements that can nudge
you in the right direction.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, perhaps
you could start

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
taking codeine bitartrate, or
huperzine A, or galantamine.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
For the purposes of
this particular module,

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
let's now have a more in-depth
look at the final one on that

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.890 align:middle line:90%
list--

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:90%
galantamine.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Galantamine is an acetylcholine
esterase inhibitor

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
and is typically prescribed
to Alzheimer's patients

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.680 align:middle line:90%
to ease their symptoms.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it
inhibits the breakdown

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
of acetylcholine, which,
when taken during the night,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.970 align:middle line:84%
can help keep certain
memory functions in place.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
This, in turn, given the
right protocol and training,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
can trigger a lucid dream.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%
But is it safe?

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, but you
certainly don't

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
want to overdo it as this can
lead to nausea and insomnia.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
avoided entirely

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.540 align:middle line:84%
if you have cardiac or
pulmonary conditions--

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.380 align:middle line:84%
asthma, for example-- or
if you're taking certain

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
medications--

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.455 align:middle line:84%
blood pressure
pills, for example.

00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
With those caveats
out of the way,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
however, I feel confident
in saying that galantamine

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is worth experimenting with,
especially if you're really

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
struggling to induce
a lucid dream.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's quite a
particular way to go about it.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.585 align:middle line:90%
So let's break down the process.

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Set an alarm for about
four-and-a-half hours after you

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:90%
first fall asleep.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We're doing this
so we can target

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:84%
the end of our third sleep
cycle and the beginning

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:58.040 align:middle line:84%
of our fourth, reason being,
targeting the first three

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:84%
isn't as effective as they're
marked predominantly by light

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and deep sleep and not much
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.910 align:middle line:84%
The fourth and fifth sleep cycle
is where the real fun begins,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and the scales start to tilt
towards a higher REM ratio.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is when you want
to take galantamine.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.530 align:middle line:90%
So wake up and pop a pill.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
8 milligrams is the recommended
dose for inducing lucidity.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
But if this is your
first time, it's

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
better to ease in
with 4 milligrams.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
Then if you seem to
tolerate the smaller dose,

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.812 align:middle line:84%
you can consider moving
up to 8 milligrams

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:41.770 align:middle line:90%
on your second attempt.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.010 align:middle line:84%
After that, proceed to
stay awake for 30 minutes.

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Get out of bed and
engage with an activity

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that's minimally stimulating--

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
meditation or
reading, for example.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can infuse something
lucid dreaming-related

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.160 align:middle line:84%
into that activity,
then that's even better.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if
you meditate, meditate

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
with a mantra, like "tonight
I will lucid dream."

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
Or if you decide to read,
read a lucid dreaming book.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Next stop, return
to bed and practice

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:90%
MILD as you're drifting off.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Please refer back
to the MILD Module

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:84%
to refresh yourself
on this, if need be.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.159 align:middle line:84%
Then from there, as long
as you've stuck rigidly

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
to this protocol, a
lucid dream very likely

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.750 align:middle line:90%
awaits in your next REM cycle.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, personally, every time
I've ever taken galantamine,

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.400 align:middle line:90%
I've become lucid.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Your mileage may vary, of
course, but it's quite possible

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:90%
you'll experience the same--

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:84%
if not immediately,
then eventually.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.416 align:middle line:90%
And so there we have it.

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
You now have everything you need
to successfully lucid dream.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:84%
From here, continue
reading about it,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:84%
watching videos about it, and
generally immersing yourself

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.270 align:middle line:90%
in the lifestyle and culture.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you too will

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
be a proficient [INAUDIBLE],,
exploring the depths

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:90%
of your inner worlds.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Good luck and happy dreaming.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:90%
