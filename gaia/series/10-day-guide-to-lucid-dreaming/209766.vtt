>> Hello.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm Reece Jones,
and welcome to using

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.295 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreaming for the
betterment of your waking life.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.170 align:middle line:84%
In this course, we'll
be going over the eight

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:90%
phases of lucid dreaming.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
From how to start a dream
journal to techniques

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:84%
on stabilizing the
dream environment.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.230 align:middle line:84%
All the way to extracting
meaning from your lucid dreams

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and applying that meaning
to your waking life.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
In the mainstream
media, lucid dreaming

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
is typically portrayed
as nothing more

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
than virtual
reality on steroids.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But don't be fooled by
this oversimplification.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Whilst lucid dreaming can be
this and is indeed for many,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:84%
there's so much more
to it than just that.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
When used intentionally
with direction and purpose,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
lucid dreaming can, in
fact, change many facets

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:90%
of your waking life.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So join me on this 10-day
course where I'll distill down

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.440 align:middle line:84%

and by the end of it,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
