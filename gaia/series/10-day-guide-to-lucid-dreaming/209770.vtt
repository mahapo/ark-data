00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm Reece Jones, and welcome
to module 2, Extracting

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Data from Your Journal.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:84%
As you may have already guessed,
we don't just log our dreams

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:90%
for the fun of it.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:84%
It can be a rewarding
process in and of itself,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
but there's more
to it than that.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:84%
There's important data
buried within these entries.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Data that can not only help you
glean interesting information

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
about your own psyche, but
also help you nail down

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.170 align:middle line:84%
your dream signs, which
are pivotal to creating

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:84%
regular lucidity further
on down the line.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This data isn't always
easy to see at first,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but once you have
the eyes for it,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.300 align:middle line:90%
it becomes glaring and obvious.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And so in this module,
I'll be showing you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
how to locate the data and
extract what you need from it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.075 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.830 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost,
know that extraction

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:90%
is a two-tiered process.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:84%
It takes place during
your initial logging,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and then again, when
you read the logs

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.960 align:middle line:84%
back a few weeks or
months down the line.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Both times are critical
in their own right.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's first look at
the initial logging.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:90%
Imagine you've just woken up.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Remember what we talked
about in the first module.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't roll over and start
checking your notifications

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.220 align:middle line:90%
on your phone or tablet.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Instead, stay
still, stay mindful,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.800 align:middle line:90%
gather your recollection.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then once you have
hold of a few plot threads,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
calmly start writing
down what you remember.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
As you do, be present
with the process.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't rush through
it on autopilot.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Really marinate in the memories
as you're writing them down

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.285 align:middle line:84%
and keep on the
lookout for patterns.

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:44.101 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm noticing that I dream
about my old dog a lot,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:90%
you might think.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Or hmm, I see I'm regularly
dreaming about flying.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
These are clear and
obvious patterns.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Other times, the patterns
might be a little subtler,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:90%
a little harder to pick up on.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, through
careful analysis,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.480 align:middle line:90%
you'll start noticing these two.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
The color purple appears a lot
in my dreams, you might think.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Or hmm, I'm noticing the
emotion of anxiety reappearing.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:90%
As you notice these things--

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.290 align:middle line:84%
big and small alike, drop them
down in the back of your dream

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.700 align:middle line:90%
journal.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.025 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll have a
long list of recurring themes.

00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:41.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Think of this list as
lucid dreaming gold dust

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
as it'll help you achieve more
lucid dreams in the future.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:90%
But we're not done yet.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:90%
The list needs refining.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%
So let's look over it.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.330 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice a whole host
of different patterns here.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Some will be no
more unbelievable.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
You might dream about your
mom a lot, for example.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And whilst these
things can still

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
be useful for
psychological analyzation,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
they don't quite make
the cut for dream signs.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
The dream sign has to
reach a certain threshold

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:90%
to be labeled as such.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it need to
be a recurring pattern,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.180 align:middle line:84%
but it also needs to
be unusual in some way.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Something that wouldn't happen
in waking life in other words.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So anything super
abstract is a dream sign.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.120 align:middle line:84%
You might regularly
dream of turning people

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
into inanimate
objects, for example.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Anything unbelievable or
impossible is a dream sign too.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.180 align:middle line:84%
You might dream of flying
a lot, for example.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Other things aren't
quite so overtly bizarre,

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.460 align:middle line:84%
but they're still
not things that

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:90%
would happen in waking life.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.515 align:middle line:84%
You might routinely dream of
being in and out of control car

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:12.315 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:16.640 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Everything that falls under this
abstract or unlikely category

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.920 align:middle line:84%
can be set aside and
titled as Dream Signs.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Write them all down on
a physical bit of paper

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and leave that bit of
paper by your bedside.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, each morning, after
writing down your dreams,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and each evening
just before bed,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I want you to read
through this list.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
As always, read
through it mindfully.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Don't rush through
it or get distracted

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:90%
whilst you're doing it.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Read through it slowly
and methodically.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And remind yourself,
the next time

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I experience one
of these things,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I'll remember I'm dreaming.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.325 align:middle line:84%
By doing this, you're training
your prospective memory.

00:06:10.325 --> 00:06:14.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
However, even some of
the more normal patterns

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:84%
can be used as
springboards into lucidity.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you dream
about your mom a lot

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and you also see her
in waking life a lot,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
you could get into
the habit of reality

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:90%
checking every time you see her.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And eventually,
these reality checks

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
will start showing up
in the dream world too.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Bu we're getting ahead
of ourselves here.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's circle back around
to reality checking

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.225 align:middle line:90%
in a future module.

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
For now, let's just
concentrate on our list

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
of strange or
unusual dream signs.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Now that you have
it, treasure it.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And add to it regularly,
because dream signs rarely

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.690 align:middle line:90%
remain static for long.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
As you grow and
have new experiences

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and meet new people,
your dream signs

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:90%
will change and evolve with you.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Some will stick around, sure,
but others will disappear

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and new ones will
emerge in their place.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Either way, you have
to stay on top of this.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Continue logging your dreams,
continue reading them back,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
and continue evaluating
your constantly shifting

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.915 align:middle line:90%
landscape of dream signs.

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll also be able
to use this list

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
for some psychological
analyzation.

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
keep on dreaming

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you're in a romantic
relationship with your father,

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.160 align:middle line:90%
that's probably worth a look.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Or if you keep on dreaming
you're in a plane crash,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%
that's probably worth
a breakdown too.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:04.610 align:middle line:90%
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that every
last element of the dream

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.110 align:middle line:84%
is ripe with meaning, I
believe the brain spits things

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.540 align:middle line:90%
out fairly randomly at times.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But if something keeps on
turning up again and again,

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:84%
there's probably
a reason for it.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Is the brain trying to
pass on a message to you?

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, I wouldn't
necessarily frame it like that.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:90%
The process is a little subtler.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:90%
Think of it like this instead.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:84%
The brain is naturally
primed to focus on things

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
it deems relevant
and as it gathers

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
data throughout the
day and then sorts

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
through that data at
night, by its very nature,

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
it will highlight things
that seem important to it.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
so-called messages lie.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Not in the literal passing
down of some esoteric wisdom

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
from your subconscious
to conscious mind

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.395 align:middle line:84%
but in the mere highlighting
of important themes.

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Come morning, you can then
look at these recurring themes

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and say, why is my
brain fixated on this?

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Why is my brain replaying this
same movie over and over again?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
To get to the bottom
of these questions,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have to
do some soul searching.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:84%
I can't spoon feed
you these answers,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
