00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Reece Jones.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to module
3, Living Lucidly.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to take a
look at a few different ways

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to bring more lucidity
into your day-to-day life.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this
a great practice

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:84%
for your mental health,
but also in time,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the lucidity you train yourself
to experience in your waking

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.895 align:middle line:84%
hours will start bleeding
into the dream world too.

00:00:50.895 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's start by circling
back around to meditation.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.680 align:middle line:84%
We talked about this
in the first module

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
improving dream recall.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's worth touching on
again as it's so much more

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:90%
than just a recall tool.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if used
properly, meditation

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
can enhance all
aspects of your life.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Better memory, better sleep,
better focus, and so on.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
If you followed my lead
in the first module,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.800 align:middle line:84%
you'll have introduced a short
meditation into your routine

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:90%
just before bed.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's great.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But now, I want you to expand
the practice into your mornings

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
This way, you'll end the
day and start the day

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%
as you mean to go on lucidly.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, the sessions
don't have to be lengthy,

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
we're not looking to become
enlightened here necessarily.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So two 15-minute sessions
is absolutely fine.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you can stay consistent
with this over time,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll reap the benefits in your
dreaming and waking life alike.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we talked about in
the first module was sobriety.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, this was
something we encouraged

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.590 align:middle line:90%
to help dream recall.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But just like
meditation, I'd now

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
like you to consider
bringing sobriety

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.170 align:middle line:90%
into more of your life.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you started by eliminating
a drinking night each week.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And if so, great.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But now I'd like you to
consider going an entire week,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, two completely dry.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Once you're
successful with that,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:90%
consider doing an entire month.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Personally, for me, I've been
sober for over five years now

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and I think the pros
far outweigh the cons.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:84%
However, I understand if you
feel some resistance to this.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Most people do.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
At the very least though, I
recommend thinking about it

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps exploring where
that resistance is coming from.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:84%
To me at this point in my life,
I view sobriety and lucidity

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
almost as synonyms.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And so the pattern continues.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.720 align:middle line:84%
The clearing of space,
the purification of mind.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In the last one or two hours
of wakefulness each day,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
try making some time for
what I call a sacred period.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, this means
an hour or two before bed.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Cut off all electronics,
dim the lights,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
stop eating, stop
exercising, make it

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
a stress-free time in all
regards, a special time.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:84%
During which you can meditate
as we laid out a moment ago,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:90%
you can read too.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
You can continue entertaining
yourself as you were.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But it should be done
in a dialed down fashion

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and without blue light
from electronics affecting

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:90%
your melatonin levels.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Before this sacred
period begins,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
it's also recommended
you go for a walk.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be a full
blown hike, although that's

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
certainly not a bad idea,
but at the very least,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
you should go for a stroll
whilst the sun setting.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.330 align:middle line:90%
A dusk walk.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't bring any entertainment
with you, just yourself.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps, a loved one.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you walk, stay
mindful and present.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
This is good for a
few different reasons.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, if you
time it during dusk,

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.450 align:middle line:84%
you'll be sending the right
signals to your brain.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.180 align:middle line:84%
It will see the dimming
light and recognize

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
that as a cue to start ramping
up melatonin production, which

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
will set you up wonderfully
for sleep later on.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, by getting
some exercise in,

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.280 align:middle line:84%
you'll be wearing down your
physical body just enough

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
so it's ready for sleep.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, by walking
without any entertainment,

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:84%
you can treat this as
another meditation period.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Another chance to
clear your mind.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, you could even
walk while silently

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.110 align:middle line:90%
repeating a mantra to yourself.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, "tonight I
will lucid dream,"

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:90%
"tonight I will lucid dream."

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.750 align:middle line:90%
"Tonight I will lucid dream."

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Lucid living takes
many different forms

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and should eventually spread
into all aspects of your life,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.320 align:middle line:90%
from the little to the big.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.900 align:middle line:84%
The big things
like meditation are

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
easy to point to
and assign value to.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But the smaller things
are often overlooked.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, your
day-to-day speech

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
should be taken into
consideration too.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:90%
How do you interact with people?

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you come from a
reactionary knee jerk

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
place, hostile and
unfriendly, or do you

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
speak mindfully
and thoughtfully?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
You should go without saying
that the former doesn't

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
train a lucid mindset
whereas the latter does.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Which isn't to say
you have to start

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.410 align:middle line:84%
censoring yourself and
not speaking your mind,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
you should, of course,
continue to do that.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.590 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
you should speak

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
precisely and with
consideration for others.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.170 align:middle line:84%
The more you do
this, the more you'll

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.705 align:middle line:90%
cultivate a lucid mindset.

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, with all
of this in place,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.190 align:middle line:90%
we arrive at sleep itself.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
It's time to lucid dream, right?

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:90%
That's coming.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
But first, we need to be mindful
of all sleeping conditions.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
After all, what's the
use of living lucidly

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
if we then go to bed in
uncomfortable, unpleasant

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:90%
conditions?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's think.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:90%
What's the room looking like?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.695 align:middle line:90%
Is it dark enough?

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It should be as dark
as you can get it,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.950 align:middle line:90%
which means no electronics.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Turn them all off.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Put up blackout
blinds if you have to.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Any bit of light can
negatively affect your sleep.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:90%
So be strict about it.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:90%
And what about the temperature?

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.695 align:middle line:90%
Is it cool enough?

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
If it's the middle
of the summer,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.560 align:middle line:84%
this becomes
especially important.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
So get the air
conditioning going.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Run the fans, do
whatever you need

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
to do to get the temperature
down to somewhere in the 60s

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:90%
Fahrenheit.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And what about sounds?

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.740 align:middle line:90%
The room needs to be quiet.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So if you live in a
busy city, perhaps, you

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
should consider earplugs.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you can run some
pink noise in the background.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Outside noises, especially
sudden loud ones

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
are very likely to wake you
up, and that's obviously

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
the last thing you want.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:90%
So there we have it.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a quick lucid living
template to start working with.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Lucid living is so
much more than just

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
prescribing a set of
rules to follow those.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
So view this module as
just a set of pointers.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
In time, you'll start
getting a feel for what

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
it all really means
and you'll come up

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
with your own
personalized protocol.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Until then, feel free
to lean into some

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:42.392 align:middle line:90%
of these tried and true methods.

00:09:42.392 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:90%
They'll serve you well.
