00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.330 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Rees Jones.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.710 align:middle line:90%
And welcome to module 5--

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.645 align:middle line:90%
practicing MILD daily.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
MILD is a type of lucid
dreaming induction technique.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Induction techniques
are, in essence,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.790 align:middle line:90%
ways to trigger a lucid dream.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Some are long and complicated.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Others are short and simple.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
Some are designed to get you
lucid whilst in the dream.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And others are designed
to transition you directly

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:90%
into the dream.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Lucid from the offset, with
no break in consciousness.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.950 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, scientists
and teachers and enthusiasts

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:84%
alike have all created variants
of these induction techniques,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
but one stands head and
shoulders above them all.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in my estimation,
it's really the only induction

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:90%
technique you'll ever need.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:84%
MILD, which stands for
Mnemonic Initiated Lucid Dream,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
was created by lucid dreaming
pioneer, Stephen LaBerge,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:84%
during his dissertation
research in 1980,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:84%
as a way to more regularly and
reliably induce lucid dreaming.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
It hinges on the idea of
perspective memory, which

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
is the type of memory we use
to remind ourselves to do stuff

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:90%
We all know how this works.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We use it all the time
in our day-to-day lives,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.260 align:middle line:84%
like when we remind ourselves to
pick something up at the store

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, or when we remind
ourselves to call someone back

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:90%
on the phone that evening.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And so by harnessing this
already familiar skill,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.550 align:middle line:84%
we can redirect it towards
our lucid dreaming practice,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and in turn, increase our
lucid dreaming frequency.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Within MILD prospective memory
technique lies the three R's--

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:90%
rescript, rehearse, and remind.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
The first R, rescript, is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You take the memory of a
dream you've already had

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and reimagine its contents.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
You start by choosing a point
in the dream which you now

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:90%
recognize as a dream sign.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you saw a dead relative
or talked to an animal,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Then at that critical point,
rescript your response

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.730 align:middle line:90%
to the dream sign.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you think, oh, yes,
of course, this is a dream.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And then rescript the rest
of the dream from there

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.510 align:middle line:84%
what might have looked
like if you'd carried on

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.700 align:middle line:90%
in the dream lucidly.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.045 align:middle line:84%
Be creative with
your rescripting.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.500 align:middle line:90%
The second R is rehearse.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Rehearsing involves visualizing
the rescripting, which

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
you may have already
been doing, but if not,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
now's the opportunity to really
conjure up a mental image.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Lead yourself through the
dream, imagining all the details

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:90%
as you go.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Getting to the
moment the dream sign

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
appears, recognizing
the dream sign,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and then unraveling the rest
of the adventure from that.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Try to really feel into
this mental imagery.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Immerse yourself
in it, experiencing

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:90%
all there is to experience.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.880 align:middle line:90%
The third and final R is remind.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Reminding is where the
prospective memory trick really

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.170 align:middle line:90%
kicks in.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself that the
next time you're dreaming,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll recognize the
dream as a dream,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and become lucid either through
recognizing the dream sign you

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
just laid out in the rescripting
and rehearsing phases

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps in some
different way.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you won't need
a dream sign at all,

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and you'll just become
spontaneously lucid.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Either way, set a firm
reminder inside your mind

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.040 align:middle line:84%
that in your next
dream, you will become

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.985 align:middle line:90%
lucid one way or another.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's MILD in a nutshell.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
But when should you
practice all of this?

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Is there a prime time?

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, typically, people
practice during the night

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
after waking up
directly from a dream.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
For example, you might
prop yourself up in bed

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.230 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of minutes,
going through the three R's

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:90%
before returning to sleep.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.210 align:middle line:84%
As I said, preferably, you'll
be rescripting and rehearsing

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:90%
a dream you just woke up from.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have any
recall in that precise moment,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:90%
don't worry.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Just rescript and rehearse
another recent dream

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:90%
you remember.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Practicing MILD
in between dreams

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
like this is undoubtedly
a perfect time to do it,

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
but don't be fooled
into thinking that this

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:90%
is the only viable time.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Just like all lucid
dreaming practices,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
this becomes a way of life
after a while, rather than

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:90%
a mere fleeting fancy.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're looking for
true lucid dreaming mastery,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:84%
consider implementing
MILD on and off

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:90%
throughout your entire day.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:84%
But what does that sort
of regular practice

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
look like in reality?

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a
suggested routine.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Check in with yourself
every hour or two.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:84%
First, performing
a reality check.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then reminding
yourself that you'll

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:27.490 align:middle line:84%
have great recall that
night and lucid dreams too.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Also, during quiet
moments, perhaps

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
during lunch or a
toilet break, you

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.660 align:middle line:84%
can run through the
mental exercises too.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a recent
non-lucid dream you had.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Rescript it, rehearse
it, and remind yourself

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.680 align:middle line:84%
that exactly this
will play out soon.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Another potent time to practice
MILD is upon getting into bed,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.380 align:middle line:90%
just before going to sleep.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
First, set your intention
to remember your dreams.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.340 align:middle line:84%
Then apply the three
R's as per usual--

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.410 align:middle line:90%
rescript, rehearse, and remind.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.170 align:middle line:90%
And let the final R--

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:84%
remind-- be the very last
thing you have in your head

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:90%
as you drift off to sleep.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you could
even experiment

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
with falling asleep to a
silent internal mantra--

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
tonight, I'll
recognize I'm dreaming.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, I'll
recognize I'm dreaming.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, I'll
recognize I'm dreaming.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Another good time to target
is upon final awakening

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Wake up, reality check to ensure
it's not a false awakening,

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
log your dreams, and then from
there, apply the three R's--

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
rescript, rehearse, and remind.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
After this, you could even
return to your dream journal

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and log the rescripted dream.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can do to instill
this new lucid narrative

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:84%
inside your mind will
be an effective tool.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Be meticulous and consistent
with these MILD drills.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Just like any habit, you have
to engage with it consistently

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:90%
to truly instill it.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So make sure you keep on coming
back multiple times a day.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Never rushing through it
just to get it over with.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Noticing all the subtle
details as you go.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Keep on practicing like this.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, through
the technique-- that is MILD--

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
you'll be having
regular lucid dreams.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:90%
