00:00:19.422 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm Rees Jones and welcome to
module 4, reality checking.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Reality checking
is in essence a way

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of testing your mental state
and your physical environment

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to ascertain which
reality you're in,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
either waking life
or dreaming life.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
By default, most of us presume
we're always awake even

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.840 align:middle line:90%
when we're not.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And so by introducing
regular reality checking

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.860 align:middle line:84%
into your waking life and in
turn your dreaming life, too,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:84%
you can buck this trend
by forcing yourself

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:84%
to stop and question
am I dreaming, the idea

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
being that eventually once you
have this ingrained as a habit,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the same question will start
arising in your dreams, too.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been doing
the reality checks properly,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
as in slowly and methodically
and in a way that doesn't jump

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to any assumptions,
then the answer

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:84%
will, of course, be
very much different.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's start
at the beginning.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
In practice, what does a
reality check look like?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, it can take
many different forms.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.990 align:middle line:84%
It can happen silently
and internally

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
within your own mind, or
it can happen externally

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.310 align:middle line:90%
in a more visible, obvious way.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
An example of an
internal reality check

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
would be asking yourself
probing questions.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, you might
think where am I. Do.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
I recognize this place?

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.280 align:middle line:90%
Have I been here before?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Never do this on autopilot or
answer in a knee-jerk fashion.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself these
questions and genuinely

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:90%
search for the real answers.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Don't just rush through
them under the assumption

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:90%
that you are indeed awake.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's helpful to
actually flip that assumption.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Assume you're dreaming, trying
to prove that you're awake,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and now with that reframing
in mind, ask yourself again

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
where am I. Do I
recognize this place?

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Have I been here before?

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:84%
During this questioning you
might realize that you actually

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
don't recognize your location
at all, in which case

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
you've already received a pretty
big clue that you're dreaming.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.100 align:middle line:84%
After all, in waking
life, you'll almost always

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
know where you are,
and even if you're

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
unfamiliar with
your surroundings,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
you should at the very least
be able to recall the timeline

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:90%
of how you got there.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So that would be a good
follow up question.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Does the timeline make sense?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Can I remember where
I was before this?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
If I can, is it possible that
I got to this new location

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:90%
in such a short period of time.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Again, if you struggle to
answer these questions,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
you can be rest assured
you're dreaming.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.355 align:middle line:84%
That or you've received
a serious brain injury.

00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
From there, lucidity
will ensue, but, again, I

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
must stress the importance
of taking these reality

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:90%
checks seriously.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
When training yourself
in waking life

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
to ask these sorts
of questions, you

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.820 align:middle line:84%
must behave in a genuinely
curious and inquisitive way.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:84%
You must convince
yourself that you really

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
have no idea whether
or not you're

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.650 align:middle line:84%
dreaming, not yet at least,
and that the only way

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.385 align:middle line:84%
to confirm or deny is
to run these tests.

00:04:53.385 --> 00:04:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at
external reality checks.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.490 align:middle line:84%
A popular example of this
is plugging your nose

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and trying to
breathe through it.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
In waking life, you obviously
won't be able to do this,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.540 align:middle line:90%
but in a dream, you will.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
However, to ensure this reality
check yields clear and accurate

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
results, you'll need
to set the fail state

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and pass state distinctly in
your mind before beginning.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:90%
So think to yourself.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
If I can breathe in through
my plugged nose, I'm dreaming,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
and if I can't breathe in
through my plugged nose,

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm awake.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Then perform the reality
check and observe the results.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Could you breathe in
through your plugged nose?

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
If so, rest assured you
are indeed dreaming,

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and you're now free to lucidly
explore the dreamscape.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
But how often should you
be performing these reality

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:90%
checks?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, simply put, a good amount.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.860 align:middle line:84%
You can't be lax about this
and just do them here and there

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:90%
when you feel like it.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Instead, you need to set
up a regime of sorts.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, start reality
checking first thing

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.630 align:middle line:84%
upon awakening every
morning, no exceptions.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
You should also get into the
habit of reality checking

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
whenever something
unexpected or unusual occurs.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, you might see a
friend walking down the street

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
you haven't seen in years.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.530 align:middle line:90%
That was unexpected.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.300 align:middle line:90%
So reality check.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, the point's not only
to give yourself reminders

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to regularly reality
check but also

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.100 align:middle line:84%
to attach the reality checks
to events that will possibly

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.170 align:middle line:90%
recur in dreams.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And rest assured unexpected
or unusual events

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.895 align:middle line:90%
happen plenty whilst dreaming.

00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Another good time
to reality check

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
is during any
experience that brings

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
on heightened emotions like
getting really upset or anxious

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
over something.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
The amygdala goes
crazy during dreaming,

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and this is the part of the
brain that regulates emotions.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that
heightened emotions are

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.810 align:middle line:90%
commonplace whilst dreaming.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It also makes sense then
to pin reality checks

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.635 align:middle line:84%
to similarly heightened
emotions in waking life.

00:08:00.635 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Anyway how you choose to
do these reality checks

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:90%
is totally up to you--

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:16.410 align:middle line:84%
internal, external, perhaps
a mixture of the two.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big fan of plugging
my nose out in public,

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
for example, so I
tend to lean more

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
towards internal reality
checks when I'm out

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and external reality
checks when I'm in.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
However, you decide
to do it, just

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
make sure you're doing
them in all sorts

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.679 align:middle line:84%
of different situations
because think if you're

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.150 align:middle line:84%
too self-conscious to reality
check when in front of people,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll ingrain a
similarly bad habit

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
whilst dreaming and become
too self-conscious to reality

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:84%
check in front of
dream characters, too,

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.710 align:middle line:90%
which is a problem.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.330 align:middle line:84%
A perfect way around
this awkwardness

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:90%
then is to adopt my technique.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:84%
When around others,
do internal reality

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.300 align:middle line:84%
checking rather than
external reality checking.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
If done right, it's
just as effective.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So in conclusion, the more you
reality check in waking life,

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll start reality
checking in your dreams, too.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you've been doing
them slowly and thoughtfully

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and with genuine doubt, they'll
start acting as a springboard

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
into lucid dreaming.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And from there, the
real fun begins.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:90%
