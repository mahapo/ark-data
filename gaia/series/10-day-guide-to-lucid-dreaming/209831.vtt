00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm Rees Jones,
and welcome to Module 8;

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:90%
learning from your inner world.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.290 align:middle line:84%
In this module,
I'll be teaching you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
how to bring about scenarios
in your lucid dreams

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that are ripe with
meaning and purpose,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
like recreating traumatic
experiences from your past

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
as a way to better come
to terms with them.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Upon first hearing this,
it's normal to feel

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:90%
a little skeptical.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.590 align:middle line:84%
You might wonder what good can
dreaming really do for trauma.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And I hear you.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a perfectly
reasonable response.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
After all, we've
grown up in a society

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.240 align:middle line:84%
that has essentially forgotten
the importance of dreaming.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most of us don't
only disregard dreaming,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
but we don't even remember
dreaming in the first place.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
it can take a while

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.540 align:middle line:84%
to recondition
ourselves and open

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540 align:middle line:84%
our minds to the full
range of possibilities.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.700 align:middle line:84%
But rest assured, the
possibilities are here,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and you don't need to have any
religious or spiritual beliefs

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
to benefit from them.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:90%
This is pure psychology.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you don't
feel skeptical.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's wariness
you feel instead.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:84%
You might think,
do I really want

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to relive these
traumatic events?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:90%
I'd much rather move past them.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:90%
And again, I hear you.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.590 align:middle line:84%
This is another
legitimate concern and one

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
you should seriously weigh
up before proceeding.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to describe
isn't for everyone,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and knowing whether or not
you're ready for such exercises

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:90%
is crucial.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:90%
However, consider this.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:84%
If strong emotions
arise when thinking

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.110 align:middle line:84%
about these past traumas, they
still have a hold over you,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.210 align:middle line:90%
I dare say.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The strong response is
an indication of that.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And so, exploring them
from different angles

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.300 align:middle line:84%
through lucid dreaming
and softening the edges

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.425 align:middle line:84%
in the process might
just be what you need.

00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you don't have to
make a decision right away,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
but at the very
least, hear me out,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and then at the
end of the module,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
you can decide whether or
not you want to proceed.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
What I'm about to describe is a
psychological healing technique

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.670 align:middle line:90%
called lucid acting.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.430 align:middle line:84%
The fundamental idea
of which is simple.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Upon gaining
lucidity, instead of

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to exert direct
and sustained control

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
over the lucid dream, set up a
specific intentional scenario.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And from there, engage with
it as if it's waking life.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
You do this not because
you're non-lucid or confused

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
about what's unfolding,
but because, instead you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
want to experience the
scenario as realistically

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.200 align:middle line:84%
as possible with the ultimate
goal of dream space closure.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a couple
of steps back here.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
First, we need to decide
what event we want to relive.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where planning for
lucidity comes back into play.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.290 align:middle line:90%
So sit down and have a think.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Be precise and intentional
about what you chose.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And once you do,
add it to your list.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Then read through this
list before bed each night

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
to remind yourself
what you have planned.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
In this module, we're
focusing on traumatic events,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.500 align:middle line:90%
but really it could be anything.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:84%
For example, perhaps you're
considering having a child soon

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and want to experiment with
some lucid dreams that let

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:90%
you experience that firsthand.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.450 align:middle line:90%
If so, add it to your list.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Manifest it in a lucid dream and
see how it resonates with you.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Try the scenario on for size and
explore how it makes you feel.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And after trying
it on, how does it

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:90%
leave you feeling the next day?

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you
could be that person

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and do that thing
in waking life too?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
So, as you can see,
there are all sorts

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:90%
of ways this tool can be used.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
But for now, as I
said, we'll focus

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:90%
on reliving a traumatic event.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So nail down which event
you want to relive.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Remind yourself of it
before bed each night.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then once lucid, draw upon
the memory and manifest it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might
just automatically

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.060 align:middle line:84%
find yourself in the scene
lucid, in which case, perfect.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Just roll with it from there.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
If not, you're going to want
to employ a manifestation

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:90%
technique.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Is there a door nearby?

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:84%
If so, go up to the door,
and just before you open it,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
say out loud what you expect
to see on the other side.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
When I open this door, I'll
be seven years old again

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:90%
at my dad's house.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Truly believe in your
ability to manifest it.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.535 align:middle line:84%
Then turn the knob
and open the door.

00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
If there's not a door nearby,
just use something else.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:90%
What about a mirror?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
You could employ the
same technique with that

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.900 align:middle line:90%
and then step through it.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Or what about a wall or
a bend in a corridor?

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You can use anything where your
vision is temporarily obscured.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're in an open field with
no way to block your vision,

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:90%
then use your eyelids instead.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Say to yourself, I'm
now traveling back

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.230 align:middle line:84%
to my dad's house
as a 7-year-old.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Hold a thought at the
forefront of your mind

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:84%
and close your eyes
and open them again.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Or close your eyes and fall
back or close your eyes

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and spin around, always
with the clear intent

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
that when you re-emerge
back into a stable scene,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
you'll be exactly
where you plan to be.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
This isn't as
difficult as it sounds.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.845 align:middle line:84%
Just believe you can
do it, and you will.

00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.270 align:middle line:84%
So let's jump forward and
imagine you're there now.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Your lucid acting
scene has begun,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and the traumatic
event is unfolding.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Now there are a few ways you
can approach it from here.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:84%
One way is to merely
let the scene play out

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:84%
and reap the benefits
of exposure therapy.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:84%
Exposure therapy
is used to go over

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
a whole host of different
things like fear of spiders,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, the idea being
that the more you put yourself

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
in front of a trauma or a
fear, the more your psyche will

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:90%
soften the edges, as it were.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Do this again and
again and again,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, your mind
will become equanimous

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
in the face of it.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.310 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Another approach is to actively
engage with the traumatic event

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to see it from a
different angle.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, what was going on
in the head of the person that

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.050 align:middle line:90%
traumatized you.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you could ask
them, then listen carefully

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.150 align:middle line:90%
to their response.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Whatever explanation they give
for their actions shouldn't

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
necessarily be seen as a
justification for what they

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:84%
did, but considering the
possible wounding that they too

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:84%
went through could, at the
very least, open your heart

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
and release some tension.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Here is yet another approach.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
You could actually
enter the body

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
of the person that
traumatized you

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and experience the event
through their eyes.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.770 align:middle line:84%
You could literally
roll players them.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
These two could help
you get to the bottom

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.480 align:middle line:84%
of why they said what they said
or why they did what they did.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, this shouldn't
be seen as a method

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to undermine the severity
of what you went through

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.280 align:middle line:84%
or explain away
what the person did,

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:84%
but understanding the event
in a fuller, more complete way

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
can help heal you.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
This is, of course, just
the tip of the iceberg.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Once you're familiar
with the technique,

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:84%
it can be applied in all sorts
of different creative ways.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, maybe you were the
one that acted inappropriately

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
in the past, and you're
looking for closure

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
with the person you traumatized.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:84%
That's not always
possible in waking life,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
though, because the person
might be dead or unreachable,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps it would simply
be inappropriate to reconnect

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.880 align:middle line:84%
with them after the
trauma you caused.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Neither why in this
situation, the same technique

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
can be used for you
get lucid, manifest

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the person you want to find
resolution with, and talk

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:90%
Apologize and heal.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:90%
