>> Hello.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:90%
My name is Darryl Anka.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And for the past
40 years, I have

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
been channeling an
extraterrestrial entity

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that we call Bashar.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is a first
contact specialist

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
from his civilization,
which is called Essassani,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:90%
which is in a parallel reality.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
If we were to overlap
their reality with ours,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
his planet would be about 500
light years in the direction

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Orion constellation.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
He's brought through
a lot of information

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to us over the last
40 years, and we're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
going to explore and share
some of that information today

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.610 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
him began in 1973,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
when I had two broad
daylight UFO sightings

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
here over Los Angeles,
which started investigating

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of what
that was all about,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and led me to the understanding
that Bashar and I have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement to do this
channeling before this life.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%

not to get signs.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:10%
within your soul, within your

Obviously, in explaining to
you that I have been channeling

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
consciousness for 40 years,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%
I believe we are not alone.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Our society has recently
expanded its ideas

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.740 align:middle line:90%
about extraterrestrials.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
In the past few years, we
have discovered literally

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.940 align:middle line:84%
thousands of extrasolar
planets around other stars.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to realize
that this is the rule rather

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:90%
than the exception.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, not all of those planets
are capable of harboring life

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But calculations have
been made that would

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
admit that there probably are
at least thousands, if not tens

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:84%
of thousands or even
millions of planets that

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:84%
are capable of harboring
life as we know it

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:84%
But the question that a lot
of people have is not so much,

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:90%
is there life out there?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Because most people
at this point

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
would admit that it's
probably ridiculous to think

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
that in the entire universe,
there is no other life at all.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
The question really
is, but are they here?

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.370 align:middle line:90%
Have they traveled to Earth?

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there have
been just thousands

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.800 align:middle line:84%
upon thousands of what
are called UFO sightings,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:84%
or what are now referred
to as UAP sightings

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
across the globe for
a long, long time.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And some of those sightings,
some of which I've had myself,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
are irrefutable as machines
that fly through the air.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
They are not mysterious
lights in the distance.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Many people have seen UFOs up
close and personal and cannot

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.280 align:middle line:84%
deny what they've seen any more
than they could deny seeing

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
an airplane in the sky, or
a helicopter at close range.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:10%
So the question is, are these
really extraterrestrial craft?

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:10%
Are they craft that come
from our own planet?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Advanced technological craft
from our own government

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.150 align:middle line:84%
or some other
foreign government.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is to understand
how these UFOs operate,

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.310 align:middle line:10%
and to understand
that they are still

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle line:10%
doing things that are at
least as far as we know,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:10%
beyond our technical capability.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
The idea also
extends into what are

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:84%
called contact events,
or encounter events,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
or even into the realm that
is known as alien abduction.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that realm,
most people report

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.040 align:middle line:84%
seeing a certain kind
of extraterrestrial that

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.660 align:middle line:90%
has become known as the Greys.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bashar has a very unique
story about who the Greys are

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and why they're here and
doing what it is they're doing

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in these so-called abductions.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
The idea for him is not so much
that the Greys are truly alien,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
but that they come from
a parallel reality.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And that in their
parallel reality,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:84%
long ago, they used to
be as human as we are.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:84%
That they were more
technologically minded,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.980 align:middle line:84%
more advanced, but also
perhaps a little bit

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
behind in the
spirituality department.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.840 align:middle line:84%
They took for granted the idea,
as many humans on this Earth

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
are doing, of their
connection to nature,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.570 align:middle line:84%
didn't really honor their
connection to nature,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and eventually really
destroyed their ecosystem,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
destroyed their forests,
destroyed their oceans,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the atmosphere
with their technology.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And it reached a
tipping point, according

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
to Bashar's story, that was
finally too late to reverse.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:84%
As humans, they could not
survive in their normal fashion.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
They had to go
underground, they had

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
to create underground
cities and colonies in order

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
to filter out the
pollutants from their world.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't good enough.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, they found that
they could no longer reproduce

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
because the
pollutants had entered

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:84%
their system to the point where
they could not be excised.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And they lost a lot of
their normal abilities.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They began to realize that
their species was dying out,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and their version of Earth
was becoming a wasteland.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So they had to start
mutating themselves

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to the
environment more and more.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And they became ultimately
used to living underground,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.270 align:middle line:84%
gained more and more
abilities of being

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.380 align:middle line:84%
able to survive that
way, enlarged their eyes

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to see in the dark, and
became the beings ultimately,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.750 align:middle line:84%
over generations that we
know now as the Greys.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The idea is they knew
that they were dying out,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and even cloning wasn't
going to help them

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:90%
continue their civilization.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.530 align:middle line:84%
So according to
Bashar's story, they

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
used their advanced
technology to tunnel

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
into different parallel
realities, different versions

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
of Earth that existed
alongside theirs, where

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
human DNA was still viable,
such as our reality.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And they chose to
take human DNA,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
extract it from people that they
had abducted in order to blend

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
it with their
genetics and create

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:84%
a hybrid race or several
hybrid races that would allow

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:90%
their civilization to survive.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Based on some of the information
that I originally talked about,

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
where long ago another ET race
called the Anunnaki created Homo

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
sapiens by injecting
their genetics

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:84%
into the naturally-evolved
hominid called Homo erectus,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
creating a hybrid species
called Homo sapiens.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this represents the
idea of a second generation

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
of hybridization of the
human species by the Greys

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to create these hybrids
that would not only

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:38.770 align:middle line:84%
perpetuate their
civilization, but in return

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.830 align:middle line:84%
as a gift for the gift
we have given them

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:84%
of continuing to exist,
the hybrids themselves,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
such as Bashar's civilization,
are willing to see us as family.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They're connected
to us genetically

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.710 align:middle line:84%
and are willing to give us the
information that they have been

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:84%
giving us for the past four
decades and longer to help us

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
avoid the same pitfalls and
the same result that destroyed

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.820 align:middle line:84%
the Grey civilization because
they recognize we're doing many

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of the same things that
the Greys ultimately

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:middle line:84%
did to destroy their
version of Earth.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
So in applying this information
from Bashar to our lives,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
we can seek better paths,
more constructive avenues,

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
more positive ways of doing
things so that we do not

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
follow the Greys in
their destruction

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.610 align:middle line:90%
of their version of Earth.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the questions, one
of the main questions people

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.120 align:middle line:84%
have about whether
or not ETs can

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
reach Earth is the idea of
the great and vast distances

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:90%
between the stars.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We do understand that there
may be life out there,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:84%
but many people simply do not
believe that it can reach us.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
That no technology
can actually make

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:84%
it possible from spanning
these vast gulfs of distance

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:90%
between different star systems.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, but more recently,
even our own scientists,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:84%
a few of them, have
realized that there

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.980 align:middle line:90%
are ways around this idea.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.950 align:middle line:84%
There are ways around
this shortcoming.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And that while they can
prove mathematically

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.180 align:middle line:84%
that it is possible to
go to a different star

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
system in a relatively
short amount of time,

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
the math works for
those equations,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they say that the
only impediment

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is that we simply now don't
have the technology to do so.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But a civilization 100
years, 1,000 years,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:84%
10,000 years ahead of ours
might have solved these problems

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:90%
of technology.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Might have different
ways of understanding

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
how to travel from star
to star in a relatively

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:90%
quick amount of time.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Bashar has explained the way
that his civilization does this.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And without going
into great detail

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and putting it in
simple terms, here

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
is what he said works for them.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We consider an object to exist
in a location in space and time.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But they don't think
of it that way.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
They say that every object
has a certain frequency to it.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It is made up of different
patterns of energy.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
They can look at those patterns
of energy almost as an equation.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.690 align:middle line:84%
One part of that equation
is the object's location

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.710 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
So they don't see an object
as existing in space and time,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
they see location as part of
the description of an object.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
They have developed the
ability to reach in and change

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that locational variable
in the equation that

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
makes up that object,
such as a spaceship.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And by changing its
locational variable,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.290 align:middle line:84%
they can change it from
location A to location B

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
by mapping out the
universe as a variety

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.030 align:middle line:84%
of different
spatial coordinates.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And by imposing a
spatial coordinate

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.350 align:middle line:84%
on their spaceships and the
crew within to represent

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
a location at a
far distant star,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and by truly overwhelming
the energy of that object,

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
then they can allow that object
to disappear from location A

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly take up
residence at location B

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.550 align:middle line:84%
without actually having traveled
the intervening distance.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.920 align:middle line:84%
It's really like an
instantaneous relocation

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.100 align:middle line:90%
of that idea.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, going back to the
holographic principle

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that everything actually exists
everywhere in the universe,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and it simply by imposing a
certain vibration upon it that

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.040 align:middle line:84%
causes it to manifest
at one location,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.730 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to the location
that it previously occupied.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
advanced technology.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They are thousands
of years ahead of us,

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
but it makes it possible
for civilizations

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
that have mastered those
kinds of technologies

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
to instantly travel from
one star to another easily,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and therefore to visit
planets such as Earth

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.250 align:middle line:84%
and to be seen as the
UFOs in our skies.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Bashar has said that one day
after open contact occurs,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
we also will learn to master
these kinds of technologies,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and that one day we will
travel to other planets

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and we will become their UFOs,
and they will wonder about us.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And we may be able to help them
reach a new age of understanding

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
of life in the galaxy,
life in the universe,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:84%
and allow us to present
them with the possibility

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
of open contact, as Bashar is
presenting this possibility

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other
thing I would like

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
to talk about, because we're
talking about soul's journey

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.770 align:middle line:84%
here and spiritual journeys
is the idea that we are not

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.560 align:middle line:84%
only not alone with regard to
physical extraterrestrials,

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
but we are never alone anyway
because we have connections

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:90%
We have spirit guides.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.630 align:middle line:90%
We have soul families.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.190 align:middle line:84%
The idea is for us to
know that they are always

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
there to help us when
we really need it,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and for us to know that we are
always receiving that help,

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
even though we may not
always be aware of it.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So the very question
of, "Are we alone?"

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.010 align:middle line:84%
can be answered not
only on a physical,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.110 align:middle line:90%
but also on a spiritual level.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is no.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:90%
We have a lot of help going on.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
praying for guidance,

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:84%
the idea of asking for
help is not so much

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:84%
the idea of asking for
something that we don't have.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The idea of asking for help
is to be in a state of grace,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
a state of allowance, a state
of gratitude and appreciation,

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be more
aware of the help

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are already
always receiving.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to not
think of that we are alone,

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
but to really understand that
we have probably never, ever

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.323 align:middle line:90%
been alone.

00:16:16.323 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
So to talk about the idea of
where these extraterrestrials

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.230 align:middle line:84%
are that are visiting
us, Bashar, of course,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
is from a civilization that
he has described very often

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:90%
in the channelings that I do.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:38.460 align:middle line:84%
The planet in their ancient
language is called Essassani,

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and it means place
of living light.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Their planet is not unlike
Earth, but it's much greener,

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
has a little bit more
water, more oxygen.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
We could survive
there if we made

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
a shift into their
parallel reality

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.970 align:middle line:90%
and landed on their planet.

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that we
might be a little bit

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.510 align:middle line:84%
dizzy at first because
of the extra oxygen,

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:90%
but we could adapt to it.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:90%
We could get used to it.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, he said that their
planet is left very green.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.859 align:middle line:84%
They don't really have a lot of
built up cities or structures

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.290 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, except
temporary ones that

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:90%
may serve a temporary purpose.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
Their spaceships
are their cities.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And some of their
spaceships are quite large,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
what you might call
motherships or city

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:24.099 align:middle line:84%
ships that can actually hold
hundreds of thousands of people.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
However, the population
on their planet

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is nowhere near
what it is on Earth.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
At any given time, the
population of Essassani

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:84%
may not exceed about
300 million individuals.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that some
are living on the planet,

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:84%
some are in ships
exploring different things,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.280 align:middle line:84%
and Bashar specifically
presents himself

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
as a first contact
specialist, which

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.930 align:middle line:84%
means it is his passion
to go and explore and meet

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:84%
different civilizations,
to make contact

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.780 align:middle line:84%
with different alien
species in different planets

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and different dimensions, and to
explore the possibility of them

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.200 align:middle line:84%
joining, in a sense, their
interstellar alliance,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
or to simply have some
form of relationship that

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
expands everyone.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.300 align:middle line:84%
This is why they're excited
about interacting with Earth.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We do things very
differently than they do.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.510 align:middle line:84%
They are learning
from us different ways

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that beings have of expressing
themselves in the same way

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:84%
we may be learning
things from him.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And to them, this expands
the Galactic family

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
that we belong to and
that they belong to.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, he has talked about
some different civilizations.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
He's talked about
civilizations that exist

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.450 align:middle line:90%
in the star system of Sirius.

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.890 align:middle line:84%
He's talked about civilizations
that exist in the star systems

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:90%
that we label as Orion.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:84%
He's talked about the
Pleiades star systems

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
as having habitable
planets in it.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
He's talked about the
Lyran systems also.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's talked about
other dimensional beings

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
that may exist beyond our
physical understanding

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.210 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
may be interacting

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.770 align:middle line:84%
with levels of our consciousness
that we may be unaware of,

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
or we may encounter
in dream experiences

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
when our physical minds
are out of the way

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and our spirit selves are more
open to receiving connections

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and communications
from beings that

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
don't have any
kind of similarity

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
to us as a physical being.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
different civilizations

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:90%
that Bashar has talked about.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that in terms of
their interstellar alliance,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.820 align:middle line:84%
there is well over at least 200
civilizations that belong to it,

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
and that there are many, many
thousands of civilizations that

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.560 align:middle line:84%
populate our galaxy alone,
let alone the other galaxies

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
in our universe, let alone
the galaxies that may

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:90%
exist in parallel realities.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:90%
So we are far from alone.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The universe, in a sense,
is teeming with life.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And if we are willing to open
up to the idea of contact

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
with other
civilizations, we will

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.455 align:middle line:84%
know very quickly that we
are certainly not alone.

00:20:02.455 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So with regard to
open contact, why

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:84%
is this a matter
of discussion now?

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Why is this important?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:10%
Even our own government
has begun to admit

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:10%
that UFOs actually do exist.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They have been captured
on cameras, on planes,

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of ways.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.100 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to start to open
up to look at this phenomenon

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.190 align:middle line:84%
as a real phenomena that
deserves a little bit

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
more investigation, perhaps
a lot more investigation.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Bashar has said that in a
sense, when we started thinking

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
about life on other planets,
that it might be more possible.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
We sent out an energy
invitation to them,

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and they responded to it.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the way that they
usually initiate contact

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.560 align:middle line:90%
with other civilizations.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Is by finding some individuals
that they can send information

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
through, and they
observe what people

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
do with that information
in that civilization,

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
whether they accept it and apply
it, or whether they reject it.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they use that as a
barometer for whether

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.050 align:middle line:84%
or not open contact is something
that that civilization wants.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Because they leave it up to us.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.810 align:middle line:84%
They leave it in our hands
to decide whether that's

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:90%
where we want to go.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to interfere
with our civilization.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
They want us to
make the decision

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:84%
as to whether that's something
that is beneficial for us.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
They are willing to
interact with us but only

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.340 align:middle line:90%
at our true invitation.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is he is sensing
that more and more people are

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
exploring the expansion
of consciousness.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.820 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
are aware that life

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:90%
is possible on other planets.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
More and more
people are exploring

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:90%
their own spiritual journeys.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.270 align:middle line:84%
This opens up the avenue for
more of these discussions.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It brings us closer
to their vibration.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we meet them halfway,
is when Bashar said, then

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle line:90%
open contact is possible.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, Bashar rarely
makes predictions

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:84%
because he has said,
in a sense, there's

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.740 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as a
prediction of the future.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a sensing
by certain people

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of the energy that exists at the
moment the prediction is made.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And if that energy
doesn't change,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.350 align:middle line:84%
then the prediction
can come to pass.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.740 align:middle line:84%
If the prediction makes
itself known in a way

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
that people don't
want that to happen,

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:84%
they can change the
energy and the prediction

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.230 align:middle line:90%
will become obsolete.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean the
initial prediction was wrong,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
it just means that the energy of
the moment that the prediction

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:84%
was made has changed,
and now we've

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.710 align:middle line:90%
gone down a different path.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
But now and then, Bashar
will make a prediction

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
when he feels that the
momentum and the energy

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
behind the prediction
is so strong that it's

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
unlikely to change.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:52.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, in 1998, and
this was recorded on tape,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Bashar said that it
was very probable

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a
terrorist attack on New

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.600 align:middle line:90%
York before the end of 2001.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, that
has come to pass.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
He has said before
the 2016 election

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.690 align:middle line:84%
that after it in the United
States, everything would change.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I think many people would
agree that has come to pass.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:10%
The most recent
prediction he has

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.160 align:middle line:10%
been willing to make that he
feels is unlikely to shift

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:10%
is he has said there is
over a 90% probability

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.380 align:middle line:10%
that by the end of 2026
or the beginning of 2027,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:10%
there will be some
sort of contact event

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:10%
that would be
relatively undeniable.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:10%
He is not saying
why that happens,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.390 align:middle line:10%
he's not saying what
causes it to happen,

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:10%
he is simply saying
that at that point,

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:10%
there is a high degree of
probability that people on Earth

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:10%
will understand and know that
extraterrestrial life does

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.790 align:middle line:10%
exist, that contact is
potentially possible.

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.630 align:middle line:84%
We will have to wait and
see exactly what events may

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.150 align:middle line:84%
bring that about and
whether or not that

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.930 align:middle line:90%
prediction comes to pass.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, it's rare for
him to make such predictions,

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and the others that he has
made in the past have, in fact,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.520 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So we will all
together wait and see

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.820 align:middle line:84%
if this is an opportunity
for us to open up

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:16.170 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility
of open contact.

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But they will be
watching to see what

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:84%
we do with that
event, whatever it is,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and however it unfolds because
our reactions and our responses

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
to it are what's going to
tell them whether we are ready

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.500 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, there is a very
famous UFO sighting called

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.100 align:middle line:84%
the Phoenix lights that took
place back in the late '90s that

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
happened where a large mile-long
craft passed very slowly over

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.130 align:middle line:84%
the state of Arizona and was
witnessed by more than 10,000

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%
individuals.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.310 align:middle line:84%
There was hardly any
mention of it on the news,

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.820 align:middle line:84%
unless there was
being passed off

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:84%
as flares, or planes,
or lights from balloons,

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.320 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
How we responded to that,
denying that that happened,

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:84%
denying 10,000 witnesses was an
indication to Bashar and other

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.330 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrials that are
observing Earth that we simply

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.710 align:middle line:90%
were not ready for contact yet.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So we will see what happens
if this event occurs,

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:90%
as Bashar has said it might.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And we will see what
our response is,

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly, the ETs
will see what our response is.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And that will determine how
quickly open contact on Earth

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.920 align:middle line:90%
might occur.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.204 align:middle line:90%
[PENSIVE MUSIC]

00:25:35.204 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, in light of all
that's been said,

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
humans can play a very active
role in initiating contact.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
There are many
groups that are going

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:84%
into what they call CE-5
encounters, where they're going

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:90%
out into certain remote areas.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
They are sending up lights,
they are sending up thoughts,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:84%
they are reaching out
telepathically and energetically

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to invite the ETs to come
and interact with us.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
have had some measure

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:12.650 align:middle line:84%
of success in getting
responses from the UFOs.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:84%
People might shine certain
lights or flash certain lights,

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
and the UFOs will flash
lights back at them

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.520 align:middle line:90%
in the same pattern.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Things like this are the very
beginning stages of contact.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would encourage
people to go out,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.720 align:middle line:84%
to not be afraid to
initiate contact in this way

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.850 align:middle line:84%
because, again, the more people
that are willing to say, yes, we

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.890 align:middle line:84%
know you're here, we know
you've always been here,

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:84%
we're willing and ready to
accept the idea that we belong

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to a bigger universe, a bigger
family than we ever thought,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're willing to have
open contact with you,

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps the faster
open contact can occur.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So by all means, use
your imaginations,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.100 align:middle line:84%
go out, do the things
that would allow

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.280 align:middle line:84%
you to express your willingness
to have open contact.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, the ETs
will respond in some way,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
