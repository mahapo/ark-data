00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
My name is Darryl Anka,
and for the past 40 years,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I have been channeling an
extraterrestrial entity

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:90%
that we call Bashar.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is a
first-contact specialist

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
from his civilization,
which is called Essassani,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.880 align:middle line:90%
which is in a parallel reality.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.250 align:middle line:84%
If we were to overlap
their reality with ours,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
his planet would be about 500
light-years in the direction

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Orion constellation.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
He's brought through
a lot of information

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to us over the last
40 years, and we're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.670 align:middle line:84%
going to explore and share
some of that information today

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
him began in 1973

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.920 align:middle line:84%
when I had two
broad-daylight UFO sightings

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
here over Los Angeles,
which started investigating

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the idea of what
that was all about

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and led me to the understanding
that Bashar and I have

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement to do this
channeling before this life.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to present
that information to you

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

And I will say good day to
you this day of your time.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:10%
The near-death
experiences are giving you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.078 align:middle line:10%
a little bit of a snapshot,
but since they don't fully die,

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:44.620 align:middle line:10%
they're not getting
the whole picture

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:10%
because they don't go
beyond a certain point.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Because they need to come
back to the physical dream.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.420 align:middle line:84%
A question that
everyone asks when

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
they are exploring spirituality
is, what is my purpose?

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:90%
What is my mission in life?

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
The idea, fundamentally, is
to learn to be your true self.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
We all come in with the idea
of having chosen this life

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:84%
with a theme or a
purpose or a challenge

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.540 align:middle line:90%
to transform and overcome.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And the challenges that
we experience in life

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:84%
are usually representative of
the themes that as a spirit,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
we chose to explore
in physical reality.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But what does it mean to
really be your true self?

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We all innately have a vibration
in our core, a frequency that is

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%
our true essential frequency.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the frequency from
source, the frequency that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.820 align:middle line:84%
represents our connection to
existence and all that is.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It is the difference between the
frequency of our physical minds

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and the frequency of
our core vibration

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are attempting to
harmonize with in exploring

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:90%
the idea of physical reality.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:84%
We are essentially
spirit beings.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.860 align:middle line:84%
According to Bashar, we never
really leave the spirit realm.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:84%
While in spirit, we have
taken a portion of ourselves,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and we have focused
it into this dream,

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
into this experience
or this illusion

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:90%
that we call physical reality.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:84%
So from Bashar's perspective,
spirit is our natural state.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It's where we live.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But we have allowed a
portion of ourselves

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
to have this
experience by imposing

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.900 align:middle line:84%
belief systems on
ourselves that create

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
a physical mind, a focused mind
that allows us to experience

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:84%
physical reality as
if it is something

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.690 align:middle line:90%
more solid than an illusion.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And it is through this illusion
that we can discover new things.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
In spirit, we are
basically limitless beings,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:90%
timeless beings.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.590 align:middle line:84%
We can know all the answers
to all the questions.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But in order to discover
something new, in order

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to expand creation, we
have to, in a sense,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
forget who we are so
that we can remember

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:84%
who we are from a
new point of view,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
discover something, a new
perspective of ourselves.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
creation expands.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
The structure of existence,
so to speak, never changes.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
It is our relationship to
it, our experience of it,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
our perspective of existence
that always changes.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is how creation
expands and experiences

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
expansion, through
us, of itself.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So our soul's
journey is basically

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:84%
for each and every individual
soul, something quite unique

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and something quite
different, like all

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the different reflections that
you see in a hall of mirrors--

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:84%
one facing this way,
one facing that way,

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
one even perhaps being
completely turned around.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But in this case, every single
one of those reflections,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
all of us are
actually self-aware,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.190 align:middle line:84%
are conscious and having
a different experience.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And all those reflections
going back to source,

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
back to all that
is, back to god,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
goddess, whatever
you wish to call it,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:84%
are all the ways that it
has of experiencing itself

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:84%
from all the different
points of view that

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.350 align:middle line:84%
allows this continual
expansion to occur,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
even though the basic structure
of existence never changes.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:90%
But we are unique beings.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one of
us are autonomous, are,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, all that is
itself, but experiencing itself

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:84%
as a fragment of itself in this
holographic kind of exchange

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%
of experience and information.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that we set this
up by creating these belief

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:90%
systems--

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:84%
fear-based beliefs,
positive beliefs.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
All these beliefs
create the idea

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
of the solidity of
physical reality

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't break
from the illusion.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:90%
And this is how we learn.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.980 align:middle line:84%
This is how we treat
physical reality as

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.740 align:middle line:84%
if it is a solid
thing, and how we

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
imagine that we have left the
spirit reality, our spirit

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.000 align:middle line:84%
nature, in order to have this
adventure, this experience,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.840 align:middle line:84%
this game we are playing
called the Earth vibration,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
the Earth experience.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way this
works is as follows.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Belief systems, whether
positive, negative, or neutral,

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
generate certain things.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:90%
They generate emotions.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:90%
They generate thought patterns.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:90%
They generate behaviors.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of those generate
an experience that

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
creates a feedback
reflection to us so

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
that we get to experience
what we believe

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:90%
is true about ourselves.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And through these
belief systems,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we can experience and
explore the nature

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:84%
of change and transformation
and discovery.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important on our
journey, on our soul's journey,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.950 align:middle line:84%
to allow ourselves
to examine what

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
we believe to be true about
ourselves in our physical minds.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Because in generating
the idea of emotions

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
to make us feel that the belief
is true, in generating thought

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:84%
patterns to make us think
that the belief is true,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.610 align:middle line:84%
and in generating
behaviors to make

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
us behave as if
the belief is true,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
we get the reflective experience
of what we believe is true.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we wish to
change the way we feel,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
if we wish to change
the way we think,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and if we wish to change the
way we believe and change

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
the experience we are
having of physical reality,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.980 align:middle line:84%
it is very important to change
the actual belief system.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
blueprint of everything

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.260 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
in physical reality.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything that happens to us
isn't so much happening to us

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:90%
as it is happening through us.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
as spirit beings,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:84%
we actually choose to experience
physical reality as a learning

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:90%
tool.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said, only
by kind of forgetting

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
who we are as a spirit, an
unlimited, timeless being,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
and imposing these restrictions
and limitations on ourselves,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.410 align:middle line:84%
on our consciousness, can
we discover something new,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:84%
can we pretend that we've never
had this experience before

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:90%
or anything like it.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
So we come at it fresh.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.550 align:middle line:84%
We come at it with
a clean slate.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And everything
that we experience

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
is a new discovery that helps
us change and helps us grow.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And that adds information
to our soul's journey,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.170 align:middle line:90%
our soul's growth.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.880 align:middle line:84%
You could even say the soul
is kind of like unfired clay.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And through this experience
of physical reality,

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
through the fire
of experience, we

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
fire that clay into the spirit,
the unique spirit that forever

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
represents the physical being
that we have chosen to be here,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
so that when we pass back
into spirit, when we die,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:84%
that spirit always
remains and retains

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:84%
all the information
of all the experience

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that the physical being had
on its journey through life

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:90%
in physical reality.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:84%
The idea of us as
a spirit being is,

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
again, this is
our natural state.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can, from that
particular point of view,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
explore an infinite
variety of things.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
So after one particular
physical journey is over

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:84%
and we decide to
return to spirit,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:84%
then we have the
choice to explore

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
other kinds of adventures,
either physical incarnations

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:84%
again or other dimensions or
remain in spirit for a time

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
or in a timeless state,
in order to explore things

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.350 align:middle line:90%
from that point of view.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Even though those
explorations will

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.290 align:middle line:84%
be very different from a
physical-reality exploration,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.930 align:middle line:84%
it all still adds to
the soul's journey.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
It adds to our
spiritual endeavors,

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.870 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual
explorations, and adds

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:84%
to the greater being of source
to explore itself in all

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:90%
the ways that it possibly can.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's about using physical
reality to our benefit,

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to our advantage,
by really digging

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
deep down into what we believe
to be true about ourselves

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can engineer
our experience in a more

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
positive, creative,
and constructive way,

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we can live
lives of fulfillment,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
live lives of joy.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.940 align:middle line:84%
No one on Earth is
meant to struggle.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:84%
The struggles that
we experience,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
the difficulties that we
experience, the hardships

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
that we may experience,
are the result

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
of negative and
fear-based belief systems,

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:84%
are the result of
outdated definitions

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.690 align:middle line:84%
that we impose upon
ourselves so that we

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.070 align:middle line:84%
can experience certain
things in a certain way.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes
the idea of having

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:84%
some of those
negative experiences

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
may actually be a
learning tool, so

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that our soul can accelerate
through something,

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.090 align:middle line:84%
can learn to transform great
hardship into something more

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
easy, so we can
transform great darkness

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
into light, negativity
into positivity,

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:90%
limitation into freedom.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So nothing is to be
judged in the value sense

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
as being unworthy or
not really something

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.520 align:middle line:84%
that we can learn from, because
we can learn from anything.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:90%
But knowing that frees us up.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if we know that
any experience we have,

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it seems negative or
positive, difficult or easy,

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:84%
is something that can add to
our soul's growth, our soul's

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
journey, and we take it on
with a different definition

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and a different attitude, then
we can always benefit from it.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%
We can always learn from it.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
We can always expand our
consciousness from it.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes going through
what might be a crucible of fire

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
allows the porcelain
that comes out

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of that to be more refined,
more specifically focused

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:84%
on the idea of how to create a
reality for others that is also

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:90%
beneficial.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Because we are here
to be of service.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
This is a great part
of our soul's journey.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And just by living our
lives to the fullest,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
by being a living example
of following our dreams,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
staying in a positive state,
we can be a living example

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:84%
to others that they
may also choose

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.270 align:middle line:90%
that option for themselves.

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So part of our soul's journey,
part of our spirit's nature,

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is to be willing to explore
different realities,

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
to transform those
realities in positive ways,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and to be living
examples to other people

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
to help them know, by
reflection, by interaction,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
by relationship with
them, that there are

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:middle line:84%
other options and other
ways to live their lives

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than the ways we may have
experienced life for thousands

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of years in negative ways, in
hardship ways and struggling

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We are not meant to struggle,
but we are meant to transform.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to have challenges,
but challenges help us grow.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't have to be in
any way, shape, or form painful

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:90%
or a struggle.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
From Bashar's point of view, as
he has explained it many times,

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
pain is the result of resistance
to our natural, true selves,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
just like energy
going through a wire.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
If there is resistance,
the wire can heat up.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:90%
It can actually start to burn.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
It can start to melt,
and it can fall apart.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But when we become less
resistant to our true vibration,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.680 align:middle line:84%
our inner core frequency,
then that energy

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.760 align:middle line:84%
can flow through
our nervous system,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:90%
through the cells of our body.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:90%
It can actually support us.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It can energize us.

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It can raise our
frequency up, and we

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.160 align:middle line:84%
can experience many
positive things in life

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
and understand that we
have chosen these lives,

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.740 align:middle line:84%
we have chosen these challenges
from a spiritual point of view,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
knowing that physical reality
is a temporary experience that

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:84%
will add to our
understanding of ourselves

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and add to the experience
of all that is.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea of physical
reality can be

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:84%
looked at from that
point of view as a gift

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have given to
ourselves to accelerate

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:84%
our experience of life
in all of its forms,

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and it allows us to really
move forward and accelerate

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.130 align:middle line:84%
in very positive ways and
evolve not only as individuals

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
but as a species through time,
to become all that we can be,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
truly, to experience greatness
within ourselves, the fact

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
that we are extensions of a
greater being, a greater soul,

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to bring
literally heaven down to Earth.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So let's explore
a little bit more

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.890 align:middle line:90%
of the idea of the afterlife.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And even calling it an afterlife
is a little bit of a misnomer.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.000 align:middle line:84%
Because we really
do live in spirit,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and we come to physical
reality after spirit.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
So the idea of the afterlife is

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:43.500 align:middle line:84%
really more about waking up
into who we actually are.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Remembering who we
actually are is really

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.420 align:middle line:90%
what death is all about.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:90%
It's stepping through a doorway.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's very similar
to the idea, let's say,

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
that if you were in physical
reality to go to sleep

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and you had a very
realistic dream,

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.510 align:middle line:90%
it seems so absolutely real.

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you wake up in the
morning, you go, oh, wow.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:84%
Well, no matter how real that
seemed, I'm now really awake,

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.450 align:middle line:90%
and this is who I really am.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:90%
This is really my life.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, the afterlife
or the spirit realm

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:90%
is very much like that.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:84%
This physical reality
is a kind of a dream

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
that we've imposed
upon our consciousness.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
And when we die, we actually
just expand our view

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.870 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
limitations that we

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
have imposed upon
ourselves in order

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
to have the physical reality.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And in a very real way,
we are waking up back

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.760 align:middle line:84%
into our real reality of
spirit, our natural home.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we say, well, no matter
how real that physical dream

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:51.670 align:middle line:84%
seemed, this, as a spirit
being, is who I really am.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And now I can take all
of that experience.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:90%
I can learn from it.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, one of the things
that people who have what

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.610 align:middle line:84%
are called near-death
experiences often

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
have are life reviews.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And the life review is just a
recognition and a recapturing

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
of all of the experiences you
have had in that physical dream,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
in that physical experience,
in that physical life

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and learning from
every single thing.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And the way we understand
that this usually happens

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.530 align:middle line:84%
is that now, because there is no
more barrier, no more space-time

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.770 align:middle line:84%
illusion of
separation between you

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and all the people
you interacted

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
with in your physical
life, now you

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
get to experience
that connection that

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.990 align:middle line:84%
exists between everything,
that we are truly all one.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, as everyone
has described

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.060 align:middle line:84%
this life-review
process, they actually

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.620 align:middle line:84%
experience it, and everything
that they chose to have done

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and everything that
affected every other person,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
they experience it as if they
are the person being affected.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They experience it from
everyone's point of view

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.280 align:middle line:84%
that they affected in life,
positively or negatively.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:84%
So they actually go through that
entire emotional exchange as if

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.560 align:middle line:84%
everything that they
did to someone else

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.710 align:middle line:84%
or with someone else is
actually now happening to them.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And this way you learn
it's not a judgment.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not a punishment.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But this way you
learn the effect

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that you have on other
people, the consequence of all

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
the choices that
you make in life.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And the ripple effect of
all that energy going out

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
is all reflected back to
you in that life review.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Again, not in any
way, shape, or form

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.090 align:middle line:84%
as a negative thing,
but as the soul,

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:84%
then simply takes
it in and goes,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I could have made this
decision differently.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I could have chosen
something else.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I could have done this.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:90%
I could have done that.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Not with regret, but, again,
as a learning experience

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
for the soul's growth,
so that you actually

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
use the abilities you
have in the spirit

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.060 align:middle line:84%
world, the instantaneity of
timelessness, the ability

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to really, the moment you think
of something, experience it

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:10.140 align:middle line:84%
right there as if it's real,
without the time lag whatsoever.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So by learning
this way, the soul

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
absorbs a lot of
information very rapidly

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and can grow very
rapidly and make

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
choices for what it would
like to experience next.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we understand it, again,
from a lot of people who've

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.230 align:middle line:84%
had near-death experiences,
you are aided and assisted

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
by spirit guides
and family members

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:84%
in the afterlife that
help you decide what it

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:90%
is you would like to do next.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
what's the next step

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:84%
on the path of your
soul's journey.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's your greatest power,
is the freedom to choose.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, while we live
in physical reality,

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:84%
while we are still
having that experience,

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
there can be a
number of ways that

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.070 align:middle line:84%
can help people make
connections to spirit,

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.670 align:middle line:90%
to their natural self.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Some people learn
lucid dreaming so

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
that they can sort of
wake up in the dream

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and realize that they have
created physical reality.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Some people will gravitate
towards techniques

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.560 align:middle line:90%
like meditation.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Some people will
gravitate towards things

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:18.850 align:middle line:84%
that are other kinds of what
Bashar calls permission slips.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And this can be things
like numerology, astrology.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But people have to understand
these things don't control us.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
They're reflections of our
consciousness, reflections

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:90%
of where we're at.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
Bashar refers to them

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.860 align:middle line:84%
as permission slips is because
our belief system functions

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.040 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we have grown
up believing to be true

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and whatever we believe to be
true about ourselves creates

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
a certain frequency
within us that attracts us

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to certain objects and certain
techniques and certain tools.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
have those attractions

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is because that's letting us
know that those tools will help

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:84%
us make these kinds of
connections to spirit,

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:90%
to our higher selves.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So he calls them
permission slips

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:11.480 align:middle line:84%
because any tool, any technique,
any discipline, any object,

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
any source of information
that you are attracted to use

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is what you are using to
give yourself permission

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:90%
to be more of who you are.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Now you're the one doing it.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.790 align:middle line:84%
You're the one
making the change.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.120 align:middle line:84%
But your belief
system says that it

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:84%
will be easier by using
this meditative tool

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
or this astrological
technique or what have you.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:90%
So they're all valid.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:90%
They're all equal.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But they are all
permission slips

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to
tap into our ability

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.970 align:middle line:84%
to connect to our true
selves, our ability

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.370 align:middle line:84%
to connect to spirit, to
connect to other realities,

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions, and can
help raise our vibration

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and allow us to remember
who we truly are.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Some indications that we are
on this spiritual journey

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
can be sometimes what happens
through a device called

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity, where
you see certain numbers

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
or you see certain
things repeating again

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.660 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:84%
These can function as
signposts, to remind you

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:84%
that you are creating this
journey, even though it

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.800 align:middle line:84%
may be an unconscious creation,
from your physical perspective.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But when these things occur
and you see certain numbers

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.420 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, that's
reflective of the idea

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
that at that moment, you are in
the proper vibrational state,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:84%
in the proper state of being, to
remember that you have created

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.790 align:middle line:84%
this experience, that
you have planned out,

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
to a degree, this journey,
to remind you that there is

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
magic in the world,
that you are connected

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:90%
to a higher plane of existence.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So all of these little
synchronicities, the idea

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:84%
being coined by Carl
Jung, about experiencing

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:00.350 align:middle line:84%
what seems to be something
that has no apparent cause

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:04.220 align:middle line:84%
and yet has meaning to you in
its timing of appearing in front

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.430 align:middle line:84%
of you, and it is those
things that remind you

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
that you are more than
this physical reality,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
that there's something beyond,
and allows you a moment

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:84%
to contemplate why that is
happening in your reality,

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:90%
in your experience.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So it is a technique
to pay attention

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to the synchronous things
that happen in life.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.100 align:middle line:84%
Because from Bashar's
point of view,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.350 align:middle line:90%
there really are no accidents.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.270 align:middle line:90%
Everything is synchronicity.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Everything is an orchestration.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether it has
great meaning for us

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
or a little bit of meaning
for us isn't really the point.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We're all part of
this orchestration.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we
play a part that

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.080 align:middle line:84%
might be more important
for someone else

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to experience what's going on.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it might
be more important

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.450 align:middle line:84%
for us to pay attention to those
synchronicities or coincidences

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:52.690 align:middle line:90%
that are happening.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Because there is always some
information in there that

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:84%
is beneficial for us to
help us move forward,

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.380 align:middle line:84%
even if it's only telling
you that you are being

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of service to someone
else by playing

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.360 align:middle line:84%
a role in this
particular experience

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
you're having that may
be more important to them

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:12.330 align:middle line:84%
than it is for you, and
yet the importance for you

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
is that you are willing
to be of service to them.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:84%
All of these devices can help
you remember and recognize

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that you are on a path,
that you are on a path,

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
steps to that path that

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
are representative
of your true self.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
particular technique

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.780 align:middle line:84%
that Bashar has talked
about that really boils it

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:84%
all down to a tool kit
that is practically

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.950 align:middle line:90%
applicable in physical reality.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And the next episode will be
all about what that technique

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and toolkit is,
and it is referred

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:90%
to by him as the formula.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And it is something that
can make our lives much

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.660 align:middle line:10%
more transparent, much easier,
much more understandable,

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.730 align:middle line:10%
and really act as a guiding
principle or a compass needle,

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:10%
pointing in the direction
of our true north.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:14.000 align:middle line:90%
