00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, my name is Darryl
Anka, and for the past 40 years,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
I have been channeling an
extraterrestrial entity that we

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:90%
call Bashar.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is a first
contact specialist

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
from his civilization,
which is called Essassani,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:90%
which is in a parallel reality.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
If we were to overlap
their reality with ours,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
his planet would be about 500
light years in the direction

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Orion constellation.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
He's brought through
a lot of information

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to us over the last
40 years, and we're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
going to explore and share
some of that information today

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
him began in 1973,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
when I had two broad
daylight UFO sightings,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
here over Los Angeles,
which started investigating

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
the idea of what
that was all about,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and led me to the understanding
that Bashar and I have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement to do this
channeling before this life.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to present
that information to you

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%

00:01:34.820 --> 00:02:25.357 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And I will say good day
to you this day of your time.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.690 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.255 align:middle line:90%

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:10%
>> There was an early form
that you all branched off from,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:10%
but eventually a hominid form,
something similar to what you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.260 align:middle line:10%
have labeled Homo
erectus, evolved naturally

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:10%
on your planet.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
At that point, several
hundred thousand of your years

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:84%
ago, an extraterrestrial species
that called themselves the Anu

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:84%
did, in fact, come
to your world.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were in search
of certain minerals

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to assist them in the
balancing of the atmosphere

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:90%
of their own world.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Realizing what a
monumental task it was,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
they decided to inject their own
DNA, being master geneticists

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:84%
into several of the
hominid species that

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
had evolved to a certain
point and were similar enough

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to them to transform into
those that could help them

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
in this endeavor.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Thus, they created from
the original hominid form

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.866 align:middle line:84%
what came to be understood
now as Homo sapiens.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.695 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell you a story,
a story about out humanity.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And like any good story, we
need to start at the beginning.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people want to
know what the beginning was

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:90%
like for humanity.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So after channeling
for 40 years,

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
the information has often been
asked, where did we come from?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The way the story goes from
the information gathered

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
from the channeling
is as follows.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:84%
Many hundreds of
thousands of years

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.500 align:middle line:84%
ago, the natural hominid
that evolved upon the Earth

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that we often refer to
as Homo erectus existed.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
the story goes,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial
race visited the Earth.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.540 align:middle line:84%
They came to Earth
to mine minerals

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that would help them create
a balance on their planet.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And in taking on
this task, they began

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:84%
to realize that it
was quite daunting

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and would take a long
time, longer than they had.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.990 align:middle line:84%
It was very important to balance
out the weather on their planet

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:84%
with the minerals for a very,
very short period of time,

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and so they needed help
in order to do this.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They began to look around and
saw the natural hominids that

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
had evolved here,
who were close enough

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.200 align:middle line:84%
physically to the
extraterrestrials,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
that they thought,
perhaps if we can somehow

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
train them to be of assistance
in mining these minerals,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:90%
the task will go faster.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But being master
geneticists, they

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.670 align:middle line:84%
felt that a way
to accomplish this

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
would be to take
their own genetics

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and inject them
into the hominids

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and create them to
be a little bit more

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
like the extraterrestrial
race, so they would be easier

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.080 align:middle line:84%
to train so that they would
be able to understand what

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.410 align:middle line:84%
the task was all about and help
the extraterrestrials who were

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.530 align:middle line:90%
called the Anu or the Anunnaki.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So they undertook a program
of genetic alteration, where

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:84%
they introduced their
own genetics into Homo

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
erectus and other early
hominids and began to create

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:90%
what became us, Homo sapiens.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people talk about
the idea of evolution,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and they talk about
the idea of thinking

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
that there must have
been a kind of missing

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
link between early hominids
and Homo sapiens, because there

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
seems to be an evolutionary
jump that occurred,

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.380 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly, we gained much
more brain power, much more

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
brain capacity, and it
hasn't yet been fully,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
satisfactorily explained
how that occurred.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It may be possible that
this so-called missing link

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
extraterrestrials that

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:84%
came to Earth so
long ago and injected

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:84%
their DNA into the early hominid
in order to create Homo sapiens.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
As humans were
created, then they

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.380 align:middle line:84%
began to act as a workforce
to help accelerate the mining

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
operations that were
so important to the ETs

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and allowed them to
accomplish their task

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:90%
within a timely manner.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.450 align:middle line:84%
However, the idea is
that because the ETs were

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.870 align:middle line:84%
so advanced, these early
humans began to kind of look

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:84%
upon them as godlike
beings, and they

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
began to think of them as
something far above humanity.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Also, the ETs may
have acted to keep

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
the humans at a certain level.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
In many of the stories that
exist in early documents,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
such as the Bible,
these stories are told,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:84%
but they have been
sort of mythologized,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think they do represent
something a little bit

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:90%
more literal.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
When it talks about the idea,
such as the Garden of Eden

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
and how the gods
did not want humans

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to be as smart as they are, to
know the things that they knew,

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and how eating from
the tree of knowledge

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:84%
caused them to be expelled from
the Garden of Eden, so to speak.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
This may be a metaphor
for what actually happened

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of humans
seeing the gods

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to understand
what the gods knew,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
what the ETs knew.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But the ETs wanted to prevent
that because then they

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.290 align:middle line:84%
would be like them, and they
would know the things they knew,

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and they couldn't necessarily
use them as labor anymore.

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:84%
They would want
independence, as any thinking

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
being probably does.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So they curtailed
their knowledge.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
They curtailed their
ability, perhaps

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:84%
even to learn that knowledge
by not necessarily turning

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:84%
on certain markers in our DNA
and by leaving those markers

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
off, preventing us
from actually being

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:57.000 align:middle line:84%
able to learn too much
of what the ETs knew

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
and how they operated so that we
wouldn't become equal to them.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that eventually,
the extraterrestrials

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that these
beings came from may have,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
in fact, learned about
what these ETs had

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:90%
done in creating Homo sapiens.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, as far as the
story goes, it's

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
possible that they have breached
their own laws by doing this.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
It may not have been something
that they were actually

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
allowed to do in creating
a sentient species.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the story
goes that they were

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.220 align:middle line:90%
recalled to their own planet.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
And that from that
point forward,

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
once Homo sapiens
had been created,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the ETs that had recalled
the group that came to Earth

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
knew that they couldn't
just abandon mankind.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
They had to guide them
from that point forward,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
until they were assured
that mankind could perhaps

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:84%
take care of themselves, could
understand basic relationships

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and basic laws and
could create a society

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:90%
that was self-sustaining.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And so the ETs sought to teach
mankind things like agriculture

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and mathematics and so
on, so that humankind

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:90%
could become self-sustaining.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.560 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is where
the stories come from,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
of visitations from
the gods over time,

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to lead us on certain paths,
to teach us certain things,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
to watch over us and guide us.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And this relationship, I
think, solidified the idea

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that eventually became the
religions of the world, where

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.530 align:middle line:84%
we know that there is
something observing us.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that there is
something higher than us.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this in no
way, shape, or form

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
negates the idea of the
spiritual nature of God

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
or the spiritual
nature of humanity.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think these things
have become enmeshed.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:84%
These two stories have become
intertwined and enmeshed

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
with one another,
and therefore, there

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is nowadays no separation
between the idea

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:84%
of God as a spirit and
the souls of humanity

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.880 align:middle line:90%
and the idea of who created us.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think these are actually
two distinctly different story.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
While we do have a
spiritual beginning,

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
I think we also have a different
physical beginning that

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
began, as this story tells us,
with the ETs that came to Earth

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and created Homo sapiens.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But they have stayed
around to guide us

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.660 align:middle line:84%
after recalling the
group that created us,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.230 align:middle line:84%
being that that creation
was against their laws.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So in guiding us, we
now have all the stories

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
of being led through
the desert, of being

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
taught how to build
certain devices,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
how to create societies,
how to have relationships.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And this comes across
because the stories

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
have been intertwined, has
things like Commandments

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:84%
from God, which I think in the
early days was simply teaching

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.800 align:middle line:84%
humanity ways to live, ways
to understand how not to fight

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
each other, and so
on and so forth,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.230 align:middle line:84%
how to get along so that they
knew that they could eventually

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:84%
leave us to our own devices, and
that we could build societies

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that would one day
allow us to reclaim

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
our position among the
stars, being the children

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So as the story goes, the way
the ETs gave us the information

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
that we needed is they
literally came down to Earth.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
They taught us.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.720 align:middle line:84%
They showed us how to
do things practically.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the old stories of
wheels in the sky and fiery

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
demons landing on
top of mountaintops

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and dispensing
information, can literally

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:84%
be thought of as the ETs
coming down to Earth, showing

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
themselves and literally
sort of taking us by the hand

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and saying, this is
the way you do this.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
This is how you plant seeds.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.430 align:middle line:84%
This is how you
build these things.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:90%
These are the tools you need.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And when humanity
learned enough,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
then the ETs sought to, again,
leave humanity on its own.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
They may have guided
us with their ships.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
They may have sent
messages down to Earth

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
now and then-- messengers who
gave us the information we

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.370 align:middle line:90%
may have needed at that moment.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
But they mostly started
leaving us to our own devices,

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
according to the story, so
that again, they would watch.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
They would guide from
afar and over time,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
have less and less
contact with us

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
to see where we would take the
information that they imparted

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to us, to see if we
could survive on our own,

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
if we could learn to
build a civilization.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, because of
all of the information being

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
at cross purposes in the
beginning, because they

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:84%
had a different reason for
creating us than eventually

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
what came to be,
our independence

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.950 align:middle line:84%
was really a very different
goal from what they originally

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
intended, the group that
created Homo sapiens.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of this information
has gotten mixed up over time

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and lost over time in the
different civilizations

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that have evolved on Earth, so
that we're not really sure now

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
exactly what is an indication of
what physically really happened

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
and what is simply a legend,
a story, a mythology.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so nowadays,
we are attempting

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to look back at history
from our new understanding,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:84%
with our education,
with our science,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
with our evolutionary
understanding.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
look back and say,

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.780 align:middle line:84%
what can we separate out from
the stories and the mythologies?

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.420 align:middle line:84%
What actually really
happened back then?

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Because it does appear
that some of the stories

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:84%
may have a basis, in
fact, but has become

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.620 align:middle line:84%
wrapped up in the
mythology, in the legends.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very difficult,
very challenging nowadays

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.390 align:middle line:84%
to understand what really
may have physically happened

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
from what may have been
embellished over time

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:84%
for a variety of either
social or religious

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.800 align:middle line:90%
or political purposes.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Because again, mankind
being left on its own

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
has to guess a lot,
has to speculate,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
has to explore and
experiment and discover.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And some things that
we have discovered

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
lead us to believe now
that some of these stories

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:84%
may, in fact, be more
literal than we thought.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Not all of them necessarily.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of them still
remain clouded in myth.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:90%
But we are digging down.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:90%
We are discovering new things.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And the more we seem to
dig up, the more history

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.140 align:middle line:84%
seems to validate
some of these stories

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:84%
as being things that
actually did happen.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe not exactly
in the way we think,

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.190 align:middle line:84%
but they do seem to
have a basis, in fact.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:10%
And we are now at
this day and age,

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:10%
learning to slowly extract
the truth from the myths

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:10%
so that we can learn more
about where we truly came from,

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:10%
what is our actual history,
and how much did ETs really

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:10%
play a part in creating
our civilization,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:10%
in creating Homo sapiens?

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if that is
really true, and we

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
are the offshoot of this
genetic breeding program,

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.560 align:middle line:84%
then our ancestors are both
the natural hominid that

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
evolved upon the Earth and also
the ETs that came to this planet

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and gave us their DNA and
created what essentially

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
our hybrid beings, Homo
sapiens, in a sense,

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
may already be a
hybridized civilization.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.800 align:middle line:84%
This also leads to
the idea that we

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
may contain a lot more
abilities than we think.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
People that exhibit
certain kinds of gifts--

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
psychic functioning,
precognition, telepathy,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
so on and so forth,
may, in fact,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
be exhibiting the result of
this extraterrestrial genetic

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%
infusion into us so long ago.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So there may be things
and abilities that we have

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that we can, shall we say,
take from what we were

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.030 align:middle line:90%
given from the ET genetics.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And now that we are
investigating and expanding

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:84%
our own consciousness, now
that more and more people

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
are exploring the idea
of what consciousness

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is, what genetics and
DNA really are all about,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
we have found that there
may be certain aspects

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness and
certain aspects of our DNA that

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
have been a mystery to us, that
we are now beginning to learn,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.560 align:middle line:84%
may have been the result of
this extraterrestrial breeding

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things in our DNA

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that scientists have been
referring to as junk DNA,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
because they're not exactly sure
what it does, why it's there.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That may be the remnant
of the genetic markers

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:90%
from the extraterrestrials.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
As we discover
more about our DNA,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.670 align:middle line:84%
it seems that a lot more
markers that were dormant

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
are turning on, as we
expand our consciousness,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
as we discover more abilities,
more awareness, as we explore

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:84%
farther and farther out into
space and into the realm

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.670 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And we may be, in a sense,
recapturing our ET heritage.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:84%
We may suddenly have
more of the abilities

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
that the ETs were said to have,
that the gods were said to have,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
so they could do all of
these marvelous things

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:90%
that early humans marveled at.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
But we may find that those
skills, those abilities

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
are inherent within us as well
as the result of the infusion

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
of the extraterrestrial
genetics that

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
created us to be the Homo
sapiens, the human race that we

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
are today.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.300 align:middle line:10%
When the
extraterrestrials decided

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:10.890 align:middle line:10%
to inject their own DNA
into certain branches

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:10%
of the early hominids that
naturally evolved on Earth,

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.000 align:middle line:10%
such as Homo erectus,
they didn't necessarily

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.060 align:middle line:10%
alter every single branch
of these early hominids.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
According to the
information that's

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
come from Bashar
through the channeling,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.600 align:middle line:84%
those branches of Homo erectus
and other early hominids that

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
were not included in the
early genetic experiments

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:84%
from the extraterrestrials
continue to evolve naturally

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.270 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth and eventually
became what we now

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:90%
refer to as Sasquatch.

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that if the ETs
had not intervened, had not

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
given their DNA to certain
branches of the early hominids,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and we had all been allowed
to evolve naturally,

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
we would all be Sasquatch today.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Sasquatch have
evolved, apparently to have

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:90%
certain abilities as well.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:90%
They are very difficult to find.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
channeled information,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it is because they can
do something that's

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:84%
called slip-walking, which
means they naturally evolve

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:22.420 align:middle line:84%
the ability to shift in and out
of our dimension of reality.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:84%
They can hide
themselves this way.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They can avoid Homo sapiens
in this way when they need to.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons they
may be avoiding Homo sapiens

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
is because they
recognize that we

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
are the offshoots of the
extraterrestrials that

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.930 align:middle line:84%
came here and changed their
early ancestors in order

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to create this workforce, to
help them with this mining

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:90%
project that they had.

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And so they may
have felt that we

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:54.400 align:middle line:84%
became a little bit too
alien for the naturally

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
evolved hominid, as they
continue to evolve along

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
a more natural path
and became Sasquatch,

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:05.360 align:middle line:84%
which is the naturally
evolved hominid of the Earth.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of going back even
farther about where we came from

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
involves a concept
that scientists

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:90%
have called panspermia.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Panspermia is the idea
that certain kinds

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.950 align:middle line:84%
of biological elements,
elements of DNA,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
can travel through space
on comets and meteors.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And when they land
on another planet,

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:35.590 align:middle line:84%
they actually seed that planet
with that DNA material, which

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
can then, based
on the conditions

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:42.680 align:middle line:84%
of that particular planet, allow
that DNA to blossom, to grow,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
to combine molecularly, to
become the precursor for life

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
on that planet as it
happened on Earth.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So our DNA may have
originated on another planet,

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
another solar system, even
another galaxy entirely.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And when it arrived on Earth and
began the process of evolution,

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:84%
as the molecules combined
under the proper conditions,

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
it may have given
rise to the beings

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that naturally evolved
on Earth and eventually

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:19.040 align:middle line:84%
led to the naturally evolved
hominid called Homo erectus.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:25.420 align:middle line:84%
At which point the Anunnaki then
changed that evolutionary path

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:30.050 align:middle line:84%
by giving over to their
DNA the human species,

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:33.940 align:middle line:84%
the Homo sapiens, creating us to
be something that sort of jumped

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:90%
out of that evolutionary path.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
The natural hominids eventually
evolving over the eons

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
into Sasquatch, may, in fact,
have watched all of this happen

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.690 align:middle line:84%
from their own perspective,
from their own position,

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and may not necessarily be
capable of really relating to us

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
because we became kind
of the aliens on Earth.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So we may eventually find that
we can communicate once again

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
with our ancestors, with the
Sasquatch beings, Bigfoot, Yeti,

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:90%
by all the names they go by.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, as we
expand ourselves,

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
as we learn of our true
origins, as we relate

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of nature
on Earth, as we become

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:84%
less foreign, in a
sense, to the Earth,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
by reclaiming and recapturing
our humanity, our ancestry,

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.250 align:middle line:84%
we may be able to eventually
create communication

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
with the Sasquatch and
rejoin that particular branch

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.820 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But we will see if
that happens one day.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:84%
This is a very complex story
with many different angles

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:84%
to it, many different
perspectives to it,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.420 align:middle line:84%
but it is the story
overall all of humanity.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.900 align:middle line:84%
It is the story overall
of where we came from,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
according to the
channeled information

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:90%
that I brought through.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting story that

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
has many, many chapters to
it, has many different points

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.840 align:middle line:90%
of view to it.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that we can continue

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to investigate until
ultimately, perhaps one day,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:84%
we will know the entire
story of humanity,

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
the entire story of our galactic
family that we belong to.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And we will be able to tell that
story to the next generation

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and the next generation,
so they can continue

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.760 align:middle line:84%
to evolve to wherever it
is humanity is heading,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.306 align:middle line:84%
perhaps going from Homo
sapiens to Homo galacticus.

00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have mentioned that
because of the Anunnaki's

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.010 align:middle line:84%
introduction of their genetics
into the early hominid,

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Homo sapiens became a kind
of hybrid species already.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And later on in
the series, we're

00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:59.440 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about another
introduction, another infusion

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.780 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
genetics to create

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.710 align:middle line:90%
a different kind of hybrid.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And this will
eventually dovetail

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:90%
into the evolution of humanity.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But we will get
to that later on.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:84%
One other thing I would like
to add that goes hand in hand

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
with the evolution
of life on Earth,

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:84%
is going back to
the panspermia idea

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.090 align:middle line:84%
because people have
often wondered, well,

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.790 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these
extraterrestrials come to Earth.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Why do they look so human?

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Why are they so similar to us?

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think, as the
channeling has explained,

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.240 align:middle line:84%
panspermia can happen in
clusters in different areas

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.090 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.800 align:middle line:10%
So that one kind of DNA
might infuse planets

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:10%
in one area of the galaxy
and another kind of DNA,

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:10%
another arrangement of
DNA might infuse planets

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:50.960 align:middle line:10%
in another area of the galaxy.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So there might be pockets in
the galaxy of the kind of DNA

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.310 align:middle line:84%
that when it finds the right
conditions on a planet,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:84%
may actually evolve
into humanoid species.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And that may be why a lot of
the extraterrestrials we hear

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:84%
reports of also look very
much like human beings,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.880 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps even
more appropriately,

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:90%
we look like them.

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, Bashar's
people are humanoid,

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:84%
but they are related
to us genetically.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:10%
And again, that may be
what a lot of scientists

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.540 align:middle line:10%
are missing, because when
they say, well, why are

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:10%
these aliens all looking human?

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.110 align:middle line:10%
They may have had
the answer all along,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.640 align:middle line:10%
but really missed the point.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:10%
And that is that all the ones
that do look somewhat human

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.840 align:middle line:10%
may, in fact, be
genetically related to us,

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.350 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, aren't exactly
as alien as we may think.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.000 align:middle line:90%
