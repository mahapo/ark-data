00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:90%
My name is Darryl Anka.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And for the past
40 years, I have

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.900 align:middle line:84%
been channeling an
extraterrestrial entity

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
that we call Bashar.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is a First
Contact specialist

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.515 align:middle line:84%
from his civilization,
which is called Essassani,

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:90%
which is in a parallel reality.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
If we were to overlap
their reality with ours,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.800 align:middle line:84%
his planet would be about 500
light years in the direction

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Orion constellation.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
He's brought through
a lot of information

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:90%
to us over the last 40 years.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to explore and
share some of that information

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.884 align:middle line:90%
today in this series.

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
him began in 1973,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.960 align:middle line:84%
when I had two broad
daylight UFO sightings

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:84%
here over Los
Angeles, which started

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
investigating the idea of
what that was all about.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And led me to the
understanding that Bashar and I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:84%
have made an agreement
to do this channeling

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:90%
before this life.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to present
that information to you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.397 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

And I say good day to you
this day of your time.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:90%
We are the third hybrid race.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
There are two before us
and there are two after us,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:90%
forming five hybrid races.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Humanity on Earth is evolving
into the sixth hybrid race

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
as a part of its natural
evolution, its natural ability

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
to raise its frequency,
its vibration,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and become part of the
Galactic Family in earnest.

Since we began this
series with the question,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
"Where did we come from?"

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
it may only be fitting
that we end the series with

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.550 align:middle line:84%
the question, "Where
are we headed?"

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.685 align:middle line:90%
Humanity is evolving.

00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:31.900 align:middle line:84%
With all that we have talked
about in terms of interactions

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
with ETs, awareness of spirit
guides, where does all of that

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
take us?

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.390 align:middle line:84%
What are we becoming
as a species?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
Bashar, the future

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
holds a lot of
interesting experiences,

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:84%
a lot of promise for what it
is our potential is all about.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.430 align:middle line:84%
With the idea of the
hybrid civilizations

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that Bashar has mentioned,
one thing stands out--

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
in our future, the
possibility of meeting

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.285 align:middle line:84%
not only extraterrestrials
from different civilizations

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:84%
but the actual offspring of some
of the hybridization program

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and agendas that have occurred
in the alien abductions.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
Because many of
the abductees have

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
reported being
handed hybrid babies

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.920 align:middle line:84%
that are a cross between
Earth humans and the Greys.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And they are expected to get
used to them, to love them,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
to teach them what it is
like to live on Earth.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
So this speaks to the idea that
someday, open contact might not

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
only be contact with
other extraterrestrials

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
from other civilizations, but
with our own hybrid children who

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
may eventually come
to live among us.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the course of time,
perhaps blend with us,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.870 align:middle line:84%
helping Earth to
evolve and humanity

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
to evolve into what Bashar
calls the sixth hybrid race.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.685 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does this mean?

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Many people may
balk at this idea,

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
but really, what
Bashar has explained

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not an unusual
mechanism for the evolution

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
of a species, that
there are actually

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
species in the universe who
go around and actually use

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.980 align:middle line:84%
genetic material to
upgrade a civilization.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.780 align:middle line:90%
They blend them with others.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And as we do know,
diversification and the blending

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of genetic material is one
way to make a species much,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.260 align:middle line:90%
much stronger.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that this
is one mechanism that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
exists in the universe
for evolving a species.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The idea of extracting
DNA and blending it

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:84%
with the DNA of another species
that is compatible with them.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, as we said
before, the idea

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that many scientists
have just missed

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.710 align:middle line:84%
was the concept of
saying, well, why

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.230 align:middle line:84%
are all these aliens
that people have

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
talked about so human-looking?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, they
may not be truly

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:84%
alien or they may be
related to us genetically

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
because if we can actually
have beings that are created

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
from the DNA of an
Earth human and a Grey,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
then that should
speak to the idea

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that we're not that different,
that we are genetically

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
compatible to some
degree, which means

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.600 align:middle line:90%
we are related to one another.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is the history
that we have talked about

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
with regard to the Greys
coming to the Earth.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
But all of this, in many
ways, helps accelerate us

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
because many abductees also
talk about once they are exposed

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
to the Greys, once they are on
board their ships, once they go

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.940 align:middle line:84%
through these
abduction experiences,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
they come back not only changed
in terms of their outlook

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
on life but changed in
terms of their abilities.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Many abductees talk about
having more telepathy

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
in their lives, more psychic
abilities in their lives.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
this is the result

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of exposure to a different
frequency of reality.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
That when we are exposed to
these different vibrations,

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
it opens something up with
us and it may actually

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
unlock some of the
markers in our DNA

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about that
were put there by the Anunnaki

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:90%
long time ago.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So we may be really about to
experience a new renaissance

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be human.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Bashar has
even commented on the idea

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that we may not actually
be fully human yet,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
that we may be
becoming more human.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of the
Greys blending with us,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
the hybrids blending
with us, the idea

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that we may be
already the product

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:84%
of many other
extraterrestrial sources,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:03.215 align:middle line:84%
as hybridized Homo sapiens,
gives us a broad potential

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:84%
to express ourselves in many
different ways in the future.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that
Bashar has talked about

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that we are at what
he calls a splitting prism.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And what this means
to him is, going back

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of
parallel realities,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.480 align:middle line:84%
there are an infinite number
of parallel versions of Earth

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:90%
that coexist with our version.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And that we are actually
constantly shifting

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.550 align:middle line:84%
from one reality to another,
one version of Earth to another.

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
And as we change
our belief systems,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:84%
we navigate through these
different versions of Earth

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
to experience something
more and more and more

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
like the vibration and the
version of Earth that we prefer.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And this goes in a positive
and a negative direction.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Those that choose to
make negative choices

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
will experience earths that
are more negatively reflective.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Those that opt for
positive choices

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
will experience
versions of Earth that

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:90%
are more positively oriented.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.470 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, he said this
splitting prism will be such

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that we will not
necessarily interact

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
with anyone whose
vibration is completely

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.480 align:middle line:90%
incompatible with ours.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
That people will disappear from
that reality one way or another.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, we
will only be left

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
with interacting
with people that

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
are at least, to some degree,
on a similar wavelength

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:90%
that we are on.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Right now, he has said you
can still see each other,

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
you can still
observe choices being

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
made that are vibrationally
incompatible with what you

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
prefer, but this is to give you
the option to choose ultimately

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:84%
what it is that you do
prefer as a path, what

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:90%
it is you are going to explore.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, the
splitting prism,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:84%
like train tracks
leaving a station,

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
will get wider and wider
and wider and farther apart.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be more challenging
to go from one train to another

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.650 align:middle line:90%
eventually.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
As Bashar has explained
in his own civilization,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
in their evolution,
they have become so used

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of a
positive reality

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that it would actually be a
struggle for them to choose

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
something the opposite, that
negative energy, for them.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.290 align:middle line:84%
It would actually
be very challenging

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
for them to do so because
there's so much momentum

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:84%
in their collective
society, which

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.180 align:middle line:84%
is telepathically bonded for
choosing a positive experience.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So just as we have
gotten used to the idea

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
of negative experiences,
in flipping our evolution

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and in progressing
into the future,

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
it may be that as we learn to
choose more positive belief

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
systems, we may also be imbued
with this momentum, this inertia

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.520 align:middle line:84%
of being eventually
incapable of going backwards,

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
incapable of
choosing negativity,

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
incapable of buying
into fear-based beliefs.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think that will say a
lot towards where humanity

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
is evolving because the
idea is that once you

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
have a large collective
that is really focused

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
in a certain
vibrational direction,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to be much
easier for everyone else

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:90%
to join if they wish to.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It still gives them the
opportunity to choose.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
We still have the free will to
do that, but it makes it easier.

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
when we use things

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
like Bashar's formula, when
we apply it to our life, when

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
we become a living example of
the kind of positive choices

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that other people can make by
seeing the joy that it gives

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:84%
to us, we are helping them
broaden their ability to choose

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
a different kind of reality.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
We cannot force them to
choose it, and we shouldn't.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It is none of our
business what they

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.210 align:middle line:84%
choose to do with
this information

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.540 align:middle line:90%
that Bashar delivers.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.580 align:middle line:84%
He knows it's none
of his business.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
He has to leave
it up to everyone

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to have the free
will to choose what

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:84%
works for them because we don't
know everyone else's path.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what their soul
has chosen to go through.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, maybe, someone
10 years down the road

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
will remember, oh, yeah,
I remember he said this,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.800 align:middle line:84%
or I remember seeing that
person living a life of joy,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and I wondered what it is
that allows them to do that.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they will
connect to it then.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has
to remember that we

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.290 align:middle line:90%
are eternal, infinite spirits.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:90%
There's no hurry.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
We have all the
time in existence.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So what we don't
learn today, we will

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
learn tomorrow or a thousand
years or a million years

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:84%
from now, because, we will
always have challenges,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:90%
we will always be learning.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
We will always be growing
because it never began

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and so it will never, ever end.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea of our evolution,
when the hybrid children

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:84%
come to live among
us, if they do,

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:84%
will be something that would
take us exponentially up

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:84%
another level
because they're going

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to exhibit all of
the traits that we

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
apply to advanced beings.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:90%
They will be more telepathic.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:90%
They will be more psychic.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
They will be more in touch
with who and what they are.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And as Bashar has
actually said, many

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of the children being
born on Earth today

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:90%
are not just a new generation.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:90%
They are a new species.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
They have different genetics.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They have a deeper
understanding.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't forget as
much who they are.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:84%
When you talk to a lot
of young children today,

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
they talk about very
spiritual things.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
They talk about things
like reincarnation.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:84%
They talk about having
memories of other lives.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:84%
They talk about having
lives on other planets.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important for adults

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.330 align:middle line:84%
not to necessarily take
everything at face value,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
but to listen to them,
because, many children have

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the answers that
we have questions

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.710 align:middle line:84%
for if we would but listen
to them in a different way.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They are coming
into a reality where

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
probably be interacting

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrials
in their lifetime.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Remember that anyone born
in the last few decades

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
has never existed on a planet
that hasn't been in space.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:84%
We've had space travel
since the late 60s.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is normal for them.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
It creates a completely
different mindset

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:84%
when that's
something that's part

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.340 align:middle line:84%
of your daily existence,
part of your knowledge

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that there could be
life on other planets.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
It completely opens you
up in a different way.

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think these children, this
new generation, this new species

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
coming in, are going to play
a big part in humanity's

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
evolution, taking
us in new directions

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
and opening our minds
to new possibilities.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's something
to watch out for.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:90%
It's something to interact with.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And the idea, again, is not only
about extraterrestrials but also

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.020 align:middle line:90%
about our spiritual connections.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Bashar's civilization
talks about the idea

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
that it is very
challenging for us

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.065 align:middle line:84%
to even imagine what
their reality is like,

00:14:55.065 --> 00:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
because, he said, it's
not just about a bunch

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrials
walking around

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.595 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of a planet or
flying around in spaceships.

00:15:02.595 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
They have evolved to a
point where he calls himself

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
quasi-physical, which means
they have the traits of spirit

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and the traits of
physical beings.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
potentially existing

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.590 align:middle line:84%
in our future as well,
perhaps in a thousand years.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that
they have qualities

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that allow them to experience
reality as if they are walking

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.220 align:middle line:84%
through a
multidimensional dream,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.070 align:middle line:84%
where they can communicate
with spirits, where people

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:90%
who pass on are not gone.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
They're still there and
they can connect to them

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and they can
communicate with them.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is something that
we're learning to do as well.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:84%
It's something we've been able
to do for thousands of years.

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a lot of people
have doubts about it.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people ridicule it.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But again, as we open up
to different possibilities,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:84%
as we now start to
talk about the idea

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
from near-death experiences that
a spirit reality does exist,

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
as we now open up to the
idea that UFOs are real,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
even though we may
not necessarily

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.750 align:middle line:84%
admit what phenomena they
represent, these kinds of ideas

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:90%
open up discussion.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of discussions
open up the mind.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And they open us up to
more and more possibilities

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of what is probable
in our future

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and what it is we can
become as a human species.

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And what it really
means to be human

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.815 align:middle line:84%
and what it really means
to be a spiritual being.

00:16:27.815 --> 00:16:32.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So let us talk about a little
bit of these future abilities

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:90%
that we may adopt.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has the potential.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It's not everyone's
path to express them,

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.120 align:middle line:90%
but everyone has the potential.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And really, from Bashar's
point of view, a lot of it

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.630 align:middle line:84%
is about redefining
what these things are

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:90%
and how they function.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
A good example of
this is the idea

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of telepathy, which Bashar
defines as tele-empathy.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
The idea is we think,
from the old definition,

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
the outdated definition,
that telepathy

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:90%
is reading someone else's mind.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:10.314 align:middle line:84%
That's not what Bashar
says it is at all.

00:17:10.314 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
When you are on a
similar wavelength

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.720 align:middle line:84%
to someone else, when you're on
a similar vibrational frequency

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to someone else, you
have the thoughts that

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.799 align:middle line:90%
go along with that frequency.

00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:84%
As we explained in
another episode,

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:84%
you can only perceive what
you are the vibration of.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, you will
perceive everything

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that is relevant for
the frequency you're on.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And telepathy is
the idea that if you

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.460 align:middle line:84%
are matching the frequency
of another human being,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:45.080 align:middle line:84%
you will have similar thoughts
at the same time that they do.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.190 align:middle line:84%
This is why people
who are in love often

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what each
other are thinking

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
and can finish each other's
sentences, because, they're

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:90%
on the same wavelength.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
They're having the same
thoughts at the same time.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So telepathy is not reading
someone else's mind.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It's reading your own mind.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
But you're reading the
thoughts in your own mind that

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
are harmonizing with the
thoughts of someone else's

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:84%
mind at the same time because
you're on the same frequency.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we learn to redefine
what some of these abilities

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.170 align:middle line:84%
are all about, I think we
will start to experience them

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
more in more people
because we'll

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:84%
have a deeper understanding
of how they're created.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Another example might be
something like deja vu.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Almost everyone has
experienced this kind of idea.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And from Bashar's
perspective, there

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
can be many reasons for the
experience of deja vu to occur.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:84%
One of them goes back to what we
talked about in another episode

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:90%
about parallel realities.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:84%
If you are connecting to other
people in parallel realities,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:84%
even other versions of
yourself, so to speak,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.880 align:middle line:84%
that are living
other kinds of lives,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.490 align:middle line:84%
have taken other
paths than you took,

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.620 align:middle line:90%
in a parallel version of Earth.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.570 align:middle line:84%
If you're able to
tap into that--

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes there might
bleed-through or tapping

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
in unconsciously-- you might
be able to pick up on something

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:84%
that someone, another version
of you in another reality,

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:84%
has already done that
you haven't done yet

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:90%
but are leading up to it.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:84%
If you pick up on what that
person has done because,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:84%
for some reason, your
vibrational frequencies overlap

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.400 align:middle line:84%
and you lock together,
and information

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.190 align:middle line:84%
is exchanged or downloaded
on some level between you,

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
then you might
suddenly feel when

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.950 align:middle line:84%
you arrive at that
particular situation

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:90%
that, I've done this before.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.410 align:middle line:90%
This feels really familiar.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I know exactly what's
going to happen because it

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
feels like I've done it before.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So one possible
explanation might

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:84%
be that you're
getting bleed-through

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
from a parallel version of
you in another reality that

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
has already done that.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Another possibility
is, as spirits, we

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
do tend-- maybe not for
every little detail,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.980 align:middle line:84%
but we do tend to plan
out the life we're going

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.920 align:middle line:90%
to live in physical reality.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
We create a kind of blueprint
for the entire life--

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
the challenges we'll face,
the themes we're exploring,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.410 align:middle line:90%
all of that.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And maybe sometimes
very specific incidents

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
with very specific timing.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
It's very famous that
sometimes certain people know

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
the exact moment of their
death, and they predict it,

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and that's exactly
when they die.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:84%
So it could be that some
people leave that kind of thing

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.510 align:middle line:84%
open-ended for
whatever comes along

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.430 align:middle line:84%
when they're done with their
exploration of physical reality.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:90%
So they can leave anytime.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And some people may be very,
very deliberate about the time

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to
wake up back into spirit.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
if we do, in fact,

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
have some kind of blueprint
for the life we're

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.660 align:middle line:84%
going to live as
a physical being,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.700 align:middle line:84%
then sometimes while
we're living it,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe again, there's a
little bit of bleed-through,

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
we tap into that blueprint,
and we know ahead of time,

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, something
that we're going to do.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So that when we again catch up
to that blueprint, something

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
we were planning to do
in the physical life,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.750 align:middle line:84%
it may feel very familiar,
like we've already

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
done it, because,
it already exists

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.660 align:middle line:90%
in the non-physical blueprint.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the true
meaning of "as above, so below."

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It's not the other way around.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not "as below, so above."

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:84%
It's "as above," that's
where everything begins.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
set up everything.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
That's where everything
really exists.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And then it transmutes and
descends down and crystallizes

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
into this physical experience
because the physical experience

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:84%
is the dream that we
have planned to have.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So when we arrive at picking up
on that blueprint, we may feel,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.330 align:middle line:84%
well, we've been here before,
somehow on some level,

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, we have
this deja vu experience.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Bashar said something
very interesting

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:90%
about physical reality.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.100 align:middle line:84%
He said the way you know that
physical reality isn't real,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.240 align:middle line:84%
the way you know that physical
reality is an illusion is

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:90%
that it deteriorates.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:90%
What is real is forever.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
What deteriorates
is an illusion.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that we have to go

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
to sleep at night,
from his point of view,

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
is that we're reconnecting
with our spirit.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, we're
recharging our batteries

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
perpetuate and maintain

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the illusion of physical
reality because we

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:90%
have to keep refreshing it.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.460 align:middle line:84%
We have to keep
imbuing it with energy

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
because it's not real.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:90%
It dissolves.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It disintegrates.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:90%
It deteriorates.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And we have to maintain it
day after day after day.

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we go to sleep at night
for many different reasons,

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
but one of them is to
reconnect with spirit,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to recalibrate our path, to
look at the blueprint we set up,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
to decide if we're
going to change things,

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and to re-energize the
idea of maintaining

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that illusional reality that
allows us the opportunity

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:84%
to discover ourselves
in a different way.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing he said
about what physical reality is.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we come
to realize this and have

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:84%
more experiences of the
true nature of reality,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of
the illusion, then

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:13.310 align:middle line:84%
we can fall into
understanding how

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
to use the power of the
illusion instead of falling

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
under the illusion of power,
which usually does not

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.010 align:middle line:84%
work when it comes
from the physical mind.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Because the physical
mind, no matter

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.750 align:middle line:84%
how much it may want to
be, is not in charge.

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind,
the whole being,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.450 align:middle line:84%
is the one that is guiding, is
the one that sets up the path.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The physical mind has the
free will to do it however

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:90%
it wants to.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you are a
particular person.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.090 align:middle line:90%
That is your path in this life.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.450 align:middle line:84%
That is the unique hallway
you will walk down.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Anything you do, you will
do as this personality.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do it any
differently than as this person.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But how you walk down
that hallway is up to you.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.330 align:middle line:90%
You can run.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:90%
You can fly.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.200 align:middle line:90%
You can crawl.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.050 align:middle line:90%
You can be happy.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:23:59.850 align:middle line:90%
You can be sad.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You can look in every
door along the hall.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%
You can ignore them all.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:90%
You can go fast.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:90%
You can go slow.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:90%
It's up to you.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:90%
That's your free will.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But the destiny is that you
will walk down that hallway.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And the destiny is the free will
of your total spirit setting up

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.060 align:middle line:84%
that you will have
this life experience.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.970 align:middle line:84%
So destiny and free
will work hand in hand.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we learn to
understand how reality works,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.340 align:middle line:84%
how it's structured in
this way, a whole array

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
of new understandings,
new experiences

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.580 align:middle line:90%
will open up for humanity.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
We will experience evolution
in a much broader, more

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:90%
expanded way.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.930 align:middle line:84%
We will make
connections to things

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.760 align:middle line:84%
we think didn't even exist, like
extraterrestrials and spirit

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.390 align:middle line:84%
We will take back and own our
true nature as greater beings,

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:53.100 align:middle line:84%
as spirit beings on a spiritual
journey in physical reality,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:84%
because, there is nothing
about physical reality

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:84%
that is not as spiritual since
it is created from spirit.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
It is a way that spirit has
of understanding itself,

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.330 align:middle line:84%
of growing itself, of
learning about itself,

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.735 align:middle line:84%
and discovering itself
from a new perspective.

00:25:08.735 --> 00:25:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
spiritual act.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
The most physical actions
are true acts of spirit

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.840 align:middle line:84%
when you do them in
concert with the idea

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
that you are a greater being,
that you understand that this

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.120 align:middle line:84%
is your choice, you understand
you are in charge of it,

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.110 align:middle line:84%
you are in control of it, and
you pick the belief systems

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
that go hand in hand
and are harmoniously

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.940 align:middle line:84%
aligned with your true
essential core vibration.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And you live a life of joy
and live a life of passion.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we're here to learn.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the transformational age
that is going on in our planet.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the evolution
of the human species.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:49.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the direction we
can go in if we so choose.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to us,
with our free will,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
to decide what works for us
and what our path truly is.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.035 align:middle line:84%
And all of us have the
ability to make that choice.

00:25:59.035 --> 00:26:05.100 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So when all is said and
done, and everything

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
we have shared here
with you in this series,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
we would like to remind you
that this is all about who we

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.090 align:middle line:90%
are in the galaxy, in reality.

00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And that the ETs
are coming to us

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.810 align:middle line:84%
because we have sent out the
invitation for open contact.

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:32.295 align:middle line:84%
And they are asking us to
join their galactic family.

00:26:32.295 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And we are evolving,
those of us who

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
choose to, from Homo sapiens to
Homo galacticus, where we will

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
span the stars, take our
place among the stars

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:84%
with all these other beings
who are part of our family.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.560 align:middle line:84%
And we will then
spread out and share

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
what it is we have learned
here on Earth with others

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
who are open to it in other
civilizations as well.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
The future is very expansive.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.440 align:middle line:10%
All we have to do is be
willing to venture out

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:10%
beyond our expectations,
beyond our assumptions,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.920 align:middle line:10%
beyond our insistences,
and go with our flow,

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.970 align:middle line:10%
our true natural flow because
each and every one of us

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:10%
has a current in the
ocean of creation,

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.350 align:middle line:10%
and our current knows
exactly where we need to go.

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.085 align:middle line:90%
So join us on this flow.

00:27:27.085 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Be your true self.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Act on your passion.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
It makes all the
difference in the world.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm Darryl Anka.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And I thank you from
the bottom of my heart

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:10%
for watching this series.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you
for participating

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.280 align:middle line:90%
in this adventure we call life.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:10%
Good night.

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.000 align:middle line:90%
