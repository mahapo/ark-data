>>DARRYL ANKA: Hello,
my name is Darryl Anka,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and for the past
40 years, I have

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
been channeling an
extraterrestrial entity

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.220 align:middle line:90%
that we call Bashar.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Bashar is a
first-contact specialist

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
from his civilization,
which is called Essassani,

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:90%
which is in a parallel reality.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.220 align:middle line:84%
If we were to overlap
their reality with ours,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
his planet would be about 500
light-years in the direction

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the Orion constellation.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:84%
He's brought through
a lot of information

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
to us over the last
40 years, and we're

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
going to explore and share
some of that information today

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:90%
in this series.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.070 align:middle line:84%
My experience with
him began in 1973,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
when I had two broad
daylight UFO sightings

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.840 align:middle line:84%
here over Los Angeles,
which started investigating

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of what
that was all about

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and led me to the understanding
that Bashar and I have

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement to do this
channeling before this life.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So we would like to present
that information to you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.223 align:middle line:90%

us, who our true selves actually

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
The thing that I appreciate the
most about Bashar's information

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is that he has boiled this
down to a very specific set

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:84%
of actions, a
toolkit, if you will,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.625 align:middle line:84%
that makes it much easier for
us to find our path in life.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
To put it simply,
the five principles

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
involved in this toolkit,
which he calls the Formula,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:84%
are as follows, number one,
act on your highest passion.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Number two, act on it
for as long as you can,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
taking it as far as
you can until you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:90%
can take it no further.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Number three, take these actions
with absolutely no insistence,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.690 align:middle line:84%
no assumption of what the
outcome is supposed to be.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Number four, stay in a positive
state no matter what happens.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And number five, explore
your belief systems

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and let go of the fear-based
or negative ones or definitions

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that are outdated and
don't work for you anymore.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, why does this work?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.310 align:middle line:84%
The reason it works is because
acting on your passion--

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:90%
passion, what is passion?

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
What is excitement?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:90%
What is that creativity?

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:90%
What is that attraction?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Bashar explains it as
we have a physical mind

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have a higher
mind, a non-physical mind.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
The non-physical higher
mind is the portion of us

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that still exists completely in
spirit, in our natural state.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.265 align:middle line:84%
The portion that guides
us, watches over us

00:05:06.265 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:84%
as part of that spirit as
having this physical dream.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So the way that the higher mind
guides us is by speaking to us

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and sending us messages, but
because it's non-physical,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.445 align:middle line:90%
it comes in the form of energy.

00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Our physical bodies translate
that message, that energy,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
as the sensation we call
passion, excitement, attraction,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.675 align:middle line:90%
creativity, love.

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:36.445 align:middle line:90%


00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So when situations come to
us that attract us strongly,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that get us excited, that are
representative of something that

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.200 align:middle line:84%
is our passion in life, that
is the higher mind saying,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.180 align:middle line:90%
this is your path.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the next step
for you on that path.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.940 align:middle line:90%
This is who you truly are.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the vibration
of your true self.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
When we are willing to take
action on those things,

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
on that passion, we are
responding to the higher mind,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.105 align:middle line:90%
saying, yes, I heard you.

00:06:13.105 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the actions that
are important, though,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:84%
because action is the
language of physical reality,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
not words, not thoughts,
but physical actions.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
When we take those
physical actions,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:84%
we are responding
to the higher mind.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.620 align:middle line:90%
We're saying, I heard you.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to believe
that you are guiding me,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
that this is truly the
next step on my path,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and I'm willing to jump into it.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to explore it.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm willing to be
who I truly am,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
willing to be who
you have pointed out

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.725 align:middle line:84%
to me that I am because this
is my true soul's vibration.

00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of acting on it is
the first step in the toolkit.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
The willingness to
take that action

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely necessary
to get the ball rolling.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't have to
be a grand adventure.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
a life-spanning career

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.860 align:middle line:90%
or some enormous project.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Acting on your passion can be
at a very simple everyday level.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
On any given day, you
have a number of things

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.350 align:middle line:84%
that you are able
to take action on.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.810 align:middle line:84%
You can take a walk,
you can read a book,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
you can talk to a friend,
you can eat a meal,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%
you can watch a movie.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have any
life-spanning activity that

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.005 align:middle line:84%
really gets you going, you can
start simply and let it build.

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So look around to the
abilities, the actions,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.590 align:middle line:84%
the choices that are available
to you to take action on,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
on any given day, and find the
one that has even just a tiniest

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
bit more attractiveness,
even just

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the tiniest bit more excitement
in it than any other choice.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
Act on that first
to the best you can,

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
taking it as far as
you can until you

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:90%
can take it no further.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, again, it
can be something simple.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you take
action on that first,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.740 align:middle line:84%
then you're allowing
the organizing principle

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
of synchronicity to
come in and organize

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
what happens in the next
moment, and the next moment,

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:90%
and the next moment.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
If for some reason, two
things or three things

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:84%
seem equally exciting, then
you might as well flip a coin

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
flipping a coin

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
can actually help you determine
which is more exciting.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
You could say, all right,
heads, I'll take path A, tails,

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll take path B. And you flip
the coin, and it comes up tails,

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
and you go, oh,
darn, I wish it had

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.700 align:middle line:84%
been path A. Oh, I wish
it had been path A.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
So that tells you right now that
you have more attractiveness

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:90%
and more passion about path A.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
If after you do that, things
are still equal, still equally

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
exciting, more than one
thing, you have equal ability

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to act on them, then
it doesn't really

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
matter which path
you take because,

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
again, the organizing principle
of synchronicity will come in.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you are taking the path
and taking the actions that

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:84%
are not necessarily in your
best interest, synchronicity

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
will cause
circumstances to happen

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that will turn you right back
around to the other path,

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.370 align:middle line:84%
because, again, you have to let
synchronicity and the higher

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.300 align:middle line:90%
mind be your guide.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.945 align:middle line:90%
You have to listen to them.

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea of the higher mind
is like a version of yourself

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.900 align:middle line:84%
that's standing on the
mountaintop looking down

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:29.900 align:middle line:90%
into the valley.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.510 align:middle line:84%
The physical mind lives
down in the valley.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It can't see around
the next bend.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
But the higher mind
can, and therefore,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
the higher mind, by sending
you these messages that

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
contain your vibration of
passion, of who you truly are,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.060 align:middle line:84%
are guiding you to say,
if you act on this,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
you will go down the
right path for you.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
When you ignore it, when
you don't act on it,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
then you could fall into a
hole because you're thinking,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.490 align:middle line:84%
well, I know better, I'm
going to go this way.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
necessarily the path that

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.920 align:middle line:90%
is actually working for you.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.475 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:07.780 align:middle line:84%
When you do not act
on your passion,

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
then there is no reason
for your higher mind

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
to send you more opportunities
that contain passion

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.055 align:middle line:84%
if you're not willing to act
on what it's already sent you.

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
So acting on your
passion creates

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
this sort of snowball effect
and creates this dialogue

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
between your physical
mind and your higher mind,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and it can keep sending
you more opportunities

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.360 align:middle line:84%
to act on your passion, and they
can build and build and become

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.080 align:middle line:84%
greater and greater
until your entire life is

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.740 align:middle line:90%
just full of passion.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're acting
on your passion,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
on little everyday
things, you're

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
still acting on the thing that's
the most passionate for you,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.150 align:middle line:84%
the most attractive to you,
the most exciting for you.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.545 align:middle line:84%
And that still can
be a fulfilled life.

00:10:49.545 --> 00:10:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that when you
do in fact act on this formula

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and you act on your passion,
taking it as far as you can

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
until you can take
it no further.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And you have to make sure
that if the excitement

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.950 align:middle line:84%
is waning, that it's
waning naturally,

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
because it's possible that you
may have fear-based beliefs that

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
are dampening the excitement
and preventing you

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
from taking action when you
could actually be following

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.030 align:middle line:90%
a very exciting path.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn to tell the
difference between excitement

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.500 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you are allowing the
excitement to wane naturally,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:84%
it's not because you're
putting a block on it,

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
but it's just going
away, fading away,

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and you're no longer excited
about that thing you were doing.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Then you look around
for the next thing

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
that attracts your attention as
strongly, and you act on that.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And when that wanes,
you do the same again,

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:90%
you look for the next thing.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not how the things
look that tell you they're

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:84%
connected, it's the fact
that they all excited you,

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that tells you it's
part of your path.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the excitement
that is the link.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.100 align:middle line:90%
It's the thread that you follow.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes things will look
like they have nothing

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with one another,
and you might go, well,

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.540 align:middle line:84%
how can this be connected to
what I was doing over here?

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with it.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But if it is the
thing that excites

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:84%
you the most at that
point, it is telling you,

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
it has everything to do with
everything else that excites you

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get to the idea of how
those tools work in a moment.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that sometimes people

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
assume that their
path of excitement

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:84%
has to be a straight and
narrow path, from A to Z,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Very often, in fact,
more often than not,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
the curving path taking
you over here, the curving

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:84%
path attracting you over here,
is the path that is actually

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:90%
the path of least resistance.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
It is the shortest
path, the quickest path,

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
because you may need the
experience you're gaining over

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
here to fully appreciate
the experience you

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.780 align:middle line:90%
are having over here.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:10%
And this may lead
you back to it,

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:10%
but it's the excitement that
tells you need this now,

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.570 align:middle line:10%
and it'll reconnect
you over here

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:10%
because all excitement
is connected

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:10%
to every other
expression of excitement.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.495 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the tools
we'll talk about in a moment.

00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to
really trust the flow,

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to go with the flow of your
excitement, where it takes you,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.910 align:middle line:84%
because if the straight
and narrow path is really

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.490 align:middle line:84%
not your true path,
then there are

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:84%
going to be obstacles and blocks
there that will slow you down.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And the path that seems like
the long, winding, curving path,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.500 align:middle line:84%
if it is your true path, will
actually be the quickest path

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and will allow you
to accelerate and get

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
where you're going
much, much quicker

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.785 align:middle line:84%
than the straight path that
is not truly your path.

00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:38.715 align:middle line:84%
So by acting on it to the best
you can, as fully as you can,

00:13:38.715 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
using your imagination in
all the ways that you can,

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:84%
if you don't see an
opportunity to actually create

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity
where necessary, can

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
be what allows you to act on it
as fully as you can for as long

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
The next point of
that information kit,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that instruction manual, that
is the Formula, because it

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
literally is an instruction
manual for how we create

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
our physical reality, is to have
no insistence and no assumption

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever about what
the outcome of acting

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
on that passion should look
like because the absolute truth

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is, while our physical
minds may think

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.840 align:middle line:84%
we know what the ideal
outcome is supposed to be,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:25.270 align:middle line:84%
the truth is, we have absolutely
no clue what that outcome should

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.240 align:middle line:90%
look like.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes we might
guess, sometimes, again,

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
synchronistically,
we might have a hint

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
and say, OK, it came
out the way I thought

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.380 align:middle line:84%
it would, but don't fall into
that trap of thinking it always

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:84%
must because your physical
mind is not as aware

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have
as much information

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%
as the higher mind does.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And something that
needs to happen

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that is truly to your benefit
can look very different

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.390 align:middle line:84%
than the way you
thought it should look.

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
So any insistence on what
the outcome should look like

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
can actually be an impediment
to you getting what you truly

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:90%
need in life at that moment.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
may need to attract

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.430 align:middle line:90%
something you don't prefer.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that the
next principle, staying

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.870 align:middle line:84%
in a positive state, no
matter what manifests,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.920 align:middle line:84%
is what works now
if that happens

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because even if
something manifests

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:90%
that you don't prefer--

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
and I don't mean that as
in a positive/negative way,

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:90%
as a value judgment.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you recognize neutrally
that it is simply vibrationally

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:90%
incompatible with who you are.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:90%
It is just not you.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of what
you prefer in life.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:84%
But staying in a
positive state will

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
allow you to use that
manifestation in the way that

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
will benefit you in great
ways, if nothing else,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
allowing yourself to say,
all right, this manifested.

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not what I prefer, but
it's got to be here for a reason

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.790 align:middle line:84%
or it wouldn't have happened,
allows you to use it

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.000 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And it could be as
simple as saying, now

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
that I have seen what
I don't prefer, then

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
by contrast, that tells me
more clearly what I do prefer.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And that is a
positive way to use

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:84%
what you don't prefer
because now you've

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:84%
used it up for the
reason that it's there,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and so it'll go away.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You've used up its purpose,
and you can move on.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Bashar says this is
really just physics.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.520 align:middle line:84%
It's what you put out
is what you get back.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You cannot perceive something
you're not the vibration

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.475 align:middle line:90%
of first.

00:16:30.475 --> 00:16:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you go into a
negative response,

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
a negative reaction
to something that

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:84%
manifests that you don't
prefer, all you're doing

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.560 align:middle line:84%
is matching the
negative frequency,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're reinforcing
the negative experience.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.120 align:middle line:84%
If you stay in a positive state,
you'll be capable of inspiring

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.220 align:middle line:84%
yourself to know how to use
that thing that you don't prefer

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
in a positive way because
you cannot perceive even

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
inspirations, even ideas or
imaginations that are not

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.150 align:middle line:84%
relevant to the
frequency that you're on.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:04.119 align:middle line:84%
So you have to stay
in a positive state

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
to be able to even
conceive of how to use

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:90%
that thing in a positive way.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
That's the importance
of that particular step.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the fifth
step, really exploring,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.630 align:middle line:84%
diving deep down
into what you believe

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:84%
to be true about yourself in
the situation that's happening.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
to understand

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:84%
that your beliefs create
your experiential reality.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you have fear-based
beliefs, negative beliefs,

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.090 align:middle line:84%
negative definitions
about what's

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
going on in the experience,
then again, all you're doing

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
is reinforcing the
negative experience.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to really
let go of those things,

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
to ask yourself,
why do I believe

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%
this to be true about myself?

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Why do I believe
this fear-based idea?

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So to examine how you got there,
where you learned it from,

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and to really understand
that once you realize

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
it has probably
nothing to do with you,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
you picked up these
kinds of things

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.370 align:middle line:84%
as you were growing up from
your family, your friends,

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:84%
your schooling, your society,
and that they have more

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
often to do with
other people's issues

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.050 align:middle line:84%
than they have to do
with you, then you

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
can realize that these
fear-based beliefs

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
you might have about
yourself, lack of self-worth,

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
lack of deservability,
things like that,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
are really nonsensical.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They have absolutely
nothing to do with the power

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
that you contain as
an aspect of creation.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can realize
that once something

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:32.440 align:middle line:84%
is seen as nonsensical, it
just doesn't make sense.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of letting it go.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.340 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a habit
is something you

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:90%
do you don't know you're doing.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you know you're doing it,
it's not a habit, it's a choice.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep choosing
things that you don't prefer,

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:90%
you ask yourself why.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Why do I believe
this to be true?

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Why do I keep choosing this?

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
You now made it a
conscious choice.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Now you have control over it.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Now you're in the driver's seat.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Bashar explains this as
the motivational mechanism

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle line:90%
that we all have.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
The motivational mechanism works
like this, it's very simple,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:90%
and there are no exceptions.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
What you believe benefits
you, you will move toward.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
What you believe
does not benefit you,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:90%
you will move away from.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you see that you
are choosing things

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
that don't benefit
you, that can only

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
mean one thing,
if you understand

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.360 align:middle line:90%
the motivational mechanism.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
It means you have a belief that
is making that thing seem more

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
beneficial than the
alternative or make

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the alternative seem worse
than what you're already doing.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask
yourself, well,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.090 align:middle line:84%
if I'm saying that
following my passion

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and following my excitement
would cause something

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.780 align:middle line:84%
to happen that is worse
than what's happening now,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:90%
why would I believe that?

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do believe
that something bad will happen

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:84%
by acting on your passion,
you will do everything

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.530 align:middle line:84%
in your power to avoid
acting on your passion.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You will avoid
that because that's

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.390 align:middle line:84%
the motivational
mechanism at work.

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
why you would believe

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.945 align:middle line:84%
that to be true and see that it
is actually a nonsensical belief

00:20:12.945 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because if you look
around in the world

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and you see people
doing things that

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.470 align:middle line:84%
are similar to what you would
be passionate doing, well,

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.660 align:middle line:90%
if they can do it, why not you?

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
What is standing in
your way is nothing

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
but what you believe to
be true about yourself.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important to
examine those fear-based beliefs

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
and find out why you're
holding on to that.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And very often, when you do
a deep examination of them,

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:38.390 align:middle line:84%
you will find that
why you believe

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:90%
it really doesn't hold up.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:90%
It really is nonsensical.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And once something doesn't make
sense, you don't hold on to it

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:90%
It's gone.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of it.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, following that
formula, acting on your passion,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
carrying it out to the best
you can for as long as you can,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:84%
no insistence, no assumption,
staying in a positive state

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
no matter what manifests, and
examining your belief systems,

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:84%
that is the entire
instruction manual.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, Bashar can go into this.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I can go into this much deeper.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We can examine all the
details about this.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most important
things to understand

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
is that when you do actually
start using this instruction

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:84%
manual and applying it to your
life, magical things happen.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity opens
up to you, and that's

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.260 align:middle line:84%
one of the tools that
automatically springs forth

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:84%
when you, in fact,
follow this formula.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.660 align:middle line:84%
The first most important thing
is that energy comes to you.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the driving
engine of your life.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't wait to
get up in the morning

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and do this thing
you're passionate about.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.320 align:middle line:84%
You find energy you
never had before.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The second thing,
as I already said,

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
is synchronicity becomes
abundant in your life

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.040 align:middle line:90%
in a magical way.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.670 align:middle line:84%
It becomes literally
the organizing principle

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
It literally organizes
the things you need to do,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.720 align:middle line:84%
the things you need to act
on in the order in which you

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
need to act on them.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't have
time at the end of the day

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.540 align:middle line:84%
when you're passionate about
being tired and going to sleep,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
you didn't need to
do them that day.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity truly
organizes your day.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the path
of least resistance.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything becomes
an effortless action.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:90%
It becomes less of a struggle.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
path of connection

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
that connects you to all
experiences of your passion

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
that are important for
you to experience in life.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And it does this
in perfect timing,

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.803 align:middle line:84%
so you don't need
to be impatient,

00:22:35.803 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:90%
when's this going to happen?

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:90%
When's that going to happen?

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.660 align:middle line:84%
It will come to you
in perfect timing

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:84%
if it is representative of who
you truly are, representative

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
of your passion.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
It is the thing that will
actually support you in life.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.310 align:middle line:84%
There are many forms of
abundance in reality.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Money on our planet
may be one form

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.750 align:middle line:84%
of exchange, one
symbol of abundance,

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the only form.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicity is a
form of abundance.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is a
form of abundance.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Having something to trade
is a form of abundance.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Being given a gift is
a form of abundance.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Communication is a
form of abundance.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
These things can
bring other ideas

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
into your head that may
make something possible

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:84%
you thought was impossible
unless you figure out a way

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.835 align:middle line:90%
to do it in a different way.

00:23:19.835 --> 00:23:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.660 align:middle line:84%
The last tool in the kit
is the reflective mirror,

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and as you are acting
on your passion,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
the reflective mirror
will bring up anything

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.820 align:middle line:84%
within you, any belief system
that is out of alignment

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
with your core vibration,
with who you truly are,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.063 align:middle line:84%
and it will get
you to face that.

00:23:40.063 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
It will bring to your
attention that you

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
may be holding on to a belief
that doesn't work for you,

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and that gives you the
opportunity to let it go.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So you have to see
that experience

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that the reflective mirror
brings to you in reminding you

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.400 align:middle line:84%
of that, out of
alignment belief,

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.470 align:middle line:84%
not as an interruption
in your passion,

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
but as part of your excitement
because if you discover

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.720 align:middle line:84%
something that is
out of alignment,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.430 align:middle line:84%
then you have something to work
with, you have something to let

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.230 align:middle line:90%
go of.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And this also brings
us to the idea

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:90%
called the law of attraction.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's not
wrong that you have

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
to be of a certain frequency
to attract certain things,

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
but the law of attraction,
as it has often

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
been explained on Earth,
is a little bit misleading

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.440 align:middle line:84%
because people are
taught to think

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.900 align:middle line:84%
they have to learn to be
the vibration of something.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.500 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to learn to
be the vibration of what

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:90%
you need in life.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Your core frequency is
radiating from you all the time

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and automatically attracting
all the things you truly need.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to get
out of its way,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
to let go of the belief systems
that are blocking your core

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.750 align:middle line:84%
frequency from bringing
you what you need in life.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
That is the exercise
that needs to happen.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not about having
to learn to attract.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:55.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about having to learn
to let go and let in,

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.320 align:middle line:84%
to allow those things
to come to you,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:84%
to allow your core
frequency to bring you

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
what you need for a
joyful and fulfilled life.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Very often, when
people are searching,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
they may experience
anxiety in their life,

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:90%
even to the point of panic.

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But again, the idea is
that these experiences only

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
come from holding on to beliefs
that are out of alignment

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:90%
with who you are.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.300 align:middle line:84%
It's, why it's so important
to get in touch with what

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.270 align:middle line:84%
you believe to be true about
yourself in any given situation,

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.860 align:middle line:84%
because if you're panicked
about something, by digging down

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.710 align:middle line:84%
into your belief system, you
will usually find that you have

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.000 align:middle line:84%
an idea that something
horrible, something worse

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:90%
is going to happen.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
You really have to look at
that closely and find out

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
why you would believe
that to be true

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and why you're
holding on to that.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will hold on
to the most negative things

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:84%
because they have other
beliefs attached to it

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.350 align:middle line:84%
that if they let go
of that, not only will

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:84%
something worse happen, but they
might dishonor their parents.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
They might not have
any friends anymore

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.655 align:middle line:84%
because they'll be too different
or some idea like that.

00:26:10.655 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
All of these ideas that we've
been fed that prevent you

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.610 align:middle line:84%
from being who you are, are
what causes anxiety, what causes

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
your energy to be filtered
through those negative beliefs

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:90%
because that's all it is.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.840 align:middle line:90%
You only have a 100% energy.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.000 align:middle line:84%
When you flow your
energy through beliefs

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that are in alignment
with who you truly are,

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.890 align:middle line:84%
you experience your energy
as uplifting, as joyful.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:84%
When you filter your energy
through belief systems that

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
are out of alignment
with who you are,

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.920 align:middle line:84%
that's when you experience it
as anxiety, as fear, as panic.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to make fear
your friend, to understand

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
that the only reason
you would feel fear

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.270 align:middle line:84%
is that fear is
telling you, hey,

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.330 align:middle line:84%
you're flowing your
energy through a belief

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.067 align:middle line:84%
that's out of alignment
with who you are.

00:26:56.067 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm letting you know that.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm knocking on your door.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are
too afraid to face

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:84%
that, if you're too afraid to
go investigating that, then

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.190 align:middle line:84%
fear will knock louder and
louder and louder going

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:84%
into the idea of
panic mode and all

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:84%
that because it's trying to
get your attention to tell you

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.530 align:middle line:84%
you're holding on to a belief
that simply doesn't work

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.880 align:middle line:84%
for you, that's simply
not true for you,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's to your benefit
to really let it go.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And the panic will
vanish, the fear

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.780 align:middle line:10%
will vanish, the
anxiety will vanish,

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.080 align:middle line:10%
if you understand
that that's all

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.500 align:middle line:10%
you're doing is feeling
the effect of flowing

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.760 align:middle line:10%
your energy through a filtering
system that's out of alignment

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.480 align:middle line:10%
with who you truly are.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.000 align:middle line:90%
