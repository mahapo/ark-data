00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome everyone.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.057 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to go
ahead and get started.

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:10.610 align:middle line:90%
My name is Theresa Bullard.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And today's presentation is
about finding life purpose

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.700 align:middle line:90%
through the path of initiation.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you feel you
have a purpose in life that

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:84%
is unique and you're
still searching for it?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
How many of you feel you
have a unique purpose in life

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and yet you feel
like you're on it?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
How many of you, even if
you're on it, how many of you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:90%
feel like there's more?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK, good.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you
really feel ready to take

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
that next step, that next leap
of your own transformation

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to accelerate your
progression on this path?

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes, excellent.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
about life purpose

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.213 align:middle line:84%
is that every single
person is unique.

00:00:55.213 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
every single person

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.630 align:middle line:84%
is meant to fulfill
a unique purpose.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And yet in our society
today, we have so much

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
where we're trained
and programmed

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.143 align:middle line:90%
to be we have to be like this.

00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:07.310 align:middle line:90%
You have to fit in this box.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.620 align:middle line:84%
You have to do it like
everybody else does it.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
we're here for.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:84%
That's not what we're
here for at all.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to share
a bit about my own journey

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
to finding life purpose and
accelerating that process,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and then also about the
initiatory tradition

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient mystery
schools and how

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that is a tool that helps us
in fulfilling our purpose.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
So just a little bit about
my background, first of all.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So I have a PhD in
physics, and then also have

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:84%
studied very deeply into
metaphysics and Ancient Wisdom

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
teachings, ancient
mystery teachings,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and have found ultimately
my way to finding

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:90%
the path to bridging these two.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And my personal path
through initiation

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and the metaphysical studies has
been through the Modern Mystery

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.437 align:middle line:84%
And it's modern
because it's adapted--

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
it's an ancient
lineage, but that it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
adapted itself to modern times.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So it is very much
an ancient lineage

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.600 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the way back
thousands of years unbroken

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and has been carried
forward to today.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we have also here
you see a Mysterium Center.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:84%
We have a local center
here for the Mystery School

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.650 align:middle line:90%
in Los Angeles.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we also have a
number of practitioners

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
that are in the Southern
California area,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
well, really all over.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
The Mystery School is in at
least 55 different countries.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
They have representatives
with major headquarters

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:90%
in various areas.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.400 align:middle line:10%
And have any of you seen
my series on Gaia TV?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are
Gaia subscribers?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So I have a new
series on Gaia TV

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
as well called
"Mystery Teachings."

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's very much
about getting into what

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
does physics really say
and how does this parallel

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
with the metaphysics.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And especially I get into
alchemy, kabbalah, hermetics,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
ancient Western Mystery
School teachings,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:90%
but really universal.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So really, what
does physics say,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.670 align:middle line:84%
because there's a
lot of people saying,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.830 align:middle line:84%
well, quantum physics
proves consciousness

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
or the existence of the soul.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.760 align:middle line:84%
But the physicist
wouldn't say that.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do we really take
what physics is saying,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.580 align:middle line:84%
be fair to where physicists
are at with it today,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and then also how do we
reveal the ancient metaphysics

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and what it shows in parallel
to where modern physics is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
finally, I would
say catching up,

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.040 align:middle line:84%
with what ancient metaphysics
has said for a long time.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty deep
dive into these topics

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately about how
does it really relate to us.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And how does it
transform our lives.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So just a little bit
about my background.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So I had a metaphysical
upbringing, I would say.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I was very raised with an open
mind and allowed to explore

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
But for most of my
youth, that side

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.758 align:middle line:84%
was always just
sort of over here.

00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:90%
It was in the background.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:84%
It was never really
primary for me.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really
want to make it primary.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to figure
out my academics my career

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was very focused on that.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.060 align:middle line:90%
And I dove into physics.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.710 align:middle line:84%
I dove into science and went
all the way through undergrad

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:84%
into graduate
school, and you know,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I was aiming as
high as I had to go.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, like take me as far as
I need to go so that as a woman

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't hit a glass ceiling
and that I can always

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
stay on the cutting edge
wherever science goes.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That was my interest.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really know
what I wanted to do with it.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I was just sort of
following the track.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
I was following what
education laid out.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Like OK, well, your next step
is go get the master's degree.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Your next step is
go get the PhD.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And then your next step would
be well, become a professor

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:90%
or become a research scientist.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what I didn't
want, but I didn't really

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
know what I did want.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And so as I got into
graduate school,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I was thrown into 80
hours of physics a week,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
all left brain, right,
left, left, left.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And after about a year of that I
found myself feeling depressed,

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
something's missing,
where's my meaning,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.300 align:middle line:84%
where's the sense of why
am I even doing this.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And that left me in a place
of real dissatisfaction,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.260 align:middle line:84%
not only dissatisfaction
with the path

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:84%
I had chosen for
myself to pursue a PhD,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
but dissatisfaction bled over
into everything in my life.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that put
me kind of in my--

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.020 align:middle line:90%
stopped me in my tracks.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It's like all right,
what am I going to do?

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Why am I going grindstone here?

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Why am I nose to the grindstone
and sacrificing well-being

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and sacrificing happiness and
so forth just to get this PhD.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.508 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
I want to do with it.

00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
How many of you can relate to
ever having been in a situation

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
where you're like, why
the hell am I doing this?

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So I really realized
something was missing.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:90%
And so then I started to search.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.487 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's going to
bring that joy back in?

00:06:13.487 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:84%
What's going to bring
balance back in?

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.840 align:middle line:84%
What's going to bring
meaning back in?

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was as a scientist.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I systematically brought
back in every little aspect

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:90%
I had in my life prior.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I brought back in social time.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:90%
I brought back in athletics.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I brought back in
creative hobbies,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the
things that you're told

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:90%
create a well-rounded life.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And after about a year,
I was feeling better.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
But still something really key
to meaning and purpose and joy

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
was still missing.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
It's like, yeah, OK,
I feel more balanced,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:90%
but I'm still not happy.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
So what's that key?

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
What's that key
to the happiness?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I one
day realized there

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.780 align:middle line:84%
was this little light bulb
that kind of turned on

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
as I was asking and thinking
about at the back of my mind.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
starts our search is just

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:90%
asking questions.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.267 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:90%
What am I really here for?

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
What's my purpose?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Just asking those questions
and really contemplating them

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.200 align:middle line:90%
starts our search.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:90%
And so my search started.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And this light bulb
went on at some point.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, oh,
there's one thing

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you haven't brought back
into your life that I had had

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
previously, but I didn't
really prioritize.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:90%
Guess what that was?

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:90%
No, it wasn't love.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I had a great relationship
at the time, actually.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
Spirituality.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It was spirituality I had not
brought that one thing back in.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything else I had
already brought back in.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And so by then, though
I'm a physicist,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
well-indoctrinated into the
scientific way of thinking

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:90%
by then, and I was shocked.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow,
why spirituality?

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:90%
But OK, it is.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.647 align:middle line:84%
It's the only thing I
haven't brought back in,

00:07:49.647 --> 00:07:50.670 align:middle line:90%
so let's give it a shot.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
And I did and I went and
it's like all right, anything

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
believe spiritually,

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
it has to kind of complement
what I know scientifically.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.165 align:middle line:84%
And so I couldn't go for just
blind faith and religion.

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:03.540 align:middle line:84%
So I started searching science
and consciousness, science

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality in
this intersection.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And that process
then woke me up.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:90%
I got really excited.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this is why I'm studying
physics in the first place.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand the
universe and how it works.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand our
place in this bigger cosmos

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than just our
mundane little lives here.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, as I got
excited, that led me

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
to I've got to talk
to people about this.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Who can I talk to?

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But dare I open my mouth
in the physics department

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
about anything spiritual?

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.600 align:middle line:90%
It was not a good idea.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And I had watched people get
attacked for such things.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So I felt like I was a closet
spiritual person in a physics

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was starving
for community.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
I was starving for
it to find my tribe.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so then one day I just put
it out there to the Universe,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my path.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.780 align:middle line:84%
I want to find my
spiritual family.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to find my tribe.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.270 align:middle line:84%
Help me find others
of like mind.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.213 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, synchronicity
led me to get a woman,

00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:06.630 align:middle line:84%
led me to a woman
who is connected

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:90%
with the Modern Mystery School.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And I got something
called a life activation.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I'd been to lots
of expos like this by then.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd been to all
kinds of conferences.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I already was Reiki
attuned level two

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and had lots of
energy modalities done

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
on me because my mom was
really into this stuff.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, it was
like, all right, I'm open.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Skeptical, though, but
I went and I had it.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And that one activation kicked
off this sequence of events

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.630 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And they were subtle at first,
but they were very clear.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.450 align:middle line:84%
It was shifts in personal
awareness, shifts

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:84%
in like realizing
the choices I was

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
making in my life,
what was serving me,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.432 align:middle line:90%
what wasn't serving me.

00:09:48.432 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I realized something
that wasn't serving me,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.250 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden it's like,
well, what can I do different.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And immediately an answer
would come through.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So this one little activation
did something that helped

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.370 align:middle line:84%
tune me into more
of that intuition,

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.430 align:middle line:84%
helped me start
realigning by my choices,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
by my actions, by my
thoughts, realigning more

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
with my true purpose
and potential.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And it kept unfolding
over months, even years.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
That one activation kept
giving and giving and giving.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And four months down the line--

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%
after having this activation,
I did nothing else other than

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.640 align:middle line:84%
have this activation--
four months down the line,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I, for the first time in
my life, was able to say,

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is what my purpose is.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.660 align:middle line:84%
I said, I have this
passion for science

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and now I have this
passion for spirituality.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'm supposed to
bring my passions together.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And I then finally came
up with a statement

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, I'm here to bridge
science and spirituality.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.062 align:middle line:90%
Boom.

00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And that, even though I
didn't necessarily know

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
how it's going to
do it at the time--

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.935 align:middle line:90%
this was back in 2001--

00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
even though I didn't know how I
was going to do it at the time,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:90%
it gave me direction.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me some
clarity, because how,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to go and bridge
science and spirituality

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:90%
and it really--

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.355 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a model
that much at the time.

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:13.980 align:middle line:84%
There were some people
who are doing it

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
but every model that
I had, guess what?

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.630 align:middle line:84%
They were, you know, anyone
who was in physics already

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
that then went to spirituality
and was being open about it,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.930 align:middle line:90%
they were all old.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:84%
They had all lived their
whole careers already.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.420 align:middle line:90%
They had retired.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And only after retiring did they
ever come out of the closet,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, about
their spiritual beliefs.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, God, I don't
want to wait that long.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.190 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole
lifetime for me aways.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:90%
So no, I'm not going to do that.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to figure
this out now.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew, OK, whatever path
I'm going to tread from here,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sort of paving new ground.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Like I'm not going to just walk
in somebody else's footsteps

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I got to figure it out.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And that also freed me to
know I don't have to follow

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:90%
the traditional model.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
All of this off of one thing
called a life activation,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:84%
which awakens more
of our DNA potential.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It kind of switches
on the lights

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:84%
to our spiritual
empowerment, plugs us back

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.293 align:middle line:90%
into our original blueprints.

00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And all of this came
from this Mystery School.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, gosh, if
this one activation did that,

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
what else is there?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what's the next step?

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.035 align:middle line:90%
And I'd had these two brochures.

00:12:41.035 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I had these two
brochures from the one.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't talked with
her in the four months

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.595 align:middle line:84%
after getting my
life activation.

00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But I was on her newsletter list
and I had these two brochures

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.460 align:middle line:90%
that were the two next steps.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
One of them was called "The
Empower Thyself Initiation"

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
to become an adept, become
an initiate in the lineage.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And the second one was called
"The Galactic Activation."

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Or at the time we called
it the Adam Kadmon,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
which is a catalystic term
that means the divine human,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.922 align:middle line:84%
or the full godlike human,
the fully empowered human.

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:90%
So I had these two brochures.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was really funny, because
I'd read them and I'd be like,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.290 align:middle line:90%
these say nothing.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%
How can they make these claims?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, how can they talk
about 10 times empowerment?

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:20.392 align:middle line:90%
How do they measure that?

00:13:20.392 --> 00:13:22.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, my
scientific mind really

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.880 align:middle line:84%
kicked in when I
read these brochures.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's like,
they're full of shit.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.155 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:31.735 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd be about to
throw these brochures away,

00:13:31.735 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and then something, a little
voice would come in and say,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
no no, don't throw them away.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Just put them back
on your table.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.395 align:middle line:84%
So I'd put them
back on my table.

00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
They'd get buried
under my schoolwork.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, a month
or something would go by,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and I'd get really like,
OK, I gotta clean this up

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:90%
before I can work.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.168 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally
clean it up, and I

00:13:46.168 --> 00:13:47.760 align:middle line:90%
unearth these two brochures.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.990 align:middle line:90%
And then I reread them again.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I still understand
what they're saying.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd be about to throw them
away, and something would say,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:90%
no, no, no, no, put them back.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:90%
So I put them back.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And I went through like
three or four rounds of this.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:84%
They get buried I
rediscover them.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:90%
I reread them.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I don't know
what they're saying.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I'd be about to throw them away.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.225 align:middle line:84%
Something would say, no,
don't throw them away.

00:14:07.225 --> 00:14:08.850 align:middle line:84%
So this little voice,
this is something

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:84%
we have to listen
to if we really want

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to follow our true purpose.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and really reach
our true potential.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to listen to that little
voice beyond the rational mind.

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And this was a huge
lesson on my path,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.530 align:middle line:84%
especially being so
well-trained in the rational way

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So I finally realize
OK, something's

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.100 align:middle line:84%
telling me don't
throw these away.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Something is calling me
to take these next steps.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And if I look at
my life, I've had

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
a lot of changes that have
happened since I had that life

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:90%
activation.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's producing results.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So OK, I think I'm going
to go take that next step.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
made that decision,

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
guess what, I receive an email.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Perfect timing.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.478 align:middle line:84%
The head teacher of the Mystery
School is coming into town.

00:14:51.478 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:90%
I lived in Seattle at the time.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.318 align:middle line:90%
And he was doing a free lecture.

00:14:56.318 --> 00:14:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I thought OK, here's
my chance to check out

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
the source of where
this is coming from.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%
So I went.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:90%
And again I had a--

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.730 align:middle line:90%
it was an interesting story.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:84%
But it was a little hard, again,
for my rational mind to believe

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.640 align:middle line:84%
how could anyone achieve that
much in 50 years of their life.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Like it just didn't
it didn't compute

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to my in-the-box way of thinking
based on our normal society.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And so, but there
was this energy.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.810 align:middle line:84%
There was something
about the energy

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
that just kept pulling me in.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.590 align:middle line:84%
It kept saying,
you can trust this.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It felt right.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So again, heart and
what we feel versus what

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:90%
our mind is thinking.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Because our mind is polluted
by all kinds of indoctrination

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:51.412 align:middle line:90%
expectations, projections.

00:15:51.412 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
He matched none of
my expectations.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd be seeing
this old man in a tunic,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:84%
you know, all in
white and cotton,

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:90%
with a long beard and gray hair.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And he matched none of that.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So my expectations were kind
of blown out the window.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But yet the energy,
what I felt intuitively,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like something here.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It feels right.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.118 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to dip my toe.

00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take another step.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going
to dip my toe.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not diving in.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And I decided.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:90%
So I took a leap after that.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I'm going
to go find this, you know,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:middle line:90%
check out this initiation thing.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, how many of you, when you
hear the word "mystery school,"

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:90%
what--

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:84%
just out of
curiosity, what do you

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
think when you hear the
word "mystery school"?

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the first thing
that comes to mind?

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry Potter.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Say again?

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry Potter.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Harry Potter.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.193 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:16:39.193 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Unknown.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.167 align:middle line:90%
>> The unknown.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:42.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Ancient times.

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, training the
special people that would.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient times,
training special people.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Merlin.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Merlin, yes.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:90%
OK, psychic growth.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Initiation.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Initiation, yeah.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where they say
Jesus was, was a sorcerer?

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, he was.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
He was.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I thought of
ancient Egypt, all right?

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Ancient Egypt.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.282 align:middle line:84%
That was, like, what
was in my mind--

00:17:04.282 --> 00:17:06.310 align:middle line:84%
the ancient civilizations
and the ways

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:90%
that they had in their cultures.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:90%
And so what is--

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:15.970 align:middle line:90%
oh, sorry.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.210 align:middle line:84%
This is my life activation,
DNA kind of activation, slide.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I forgot that I'm up here.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So initiation is
like a key, I found.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a key to unlocking
more of our potential.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, that life activation is
something that is also ancient.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And everything in
the mystery school

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
tradition-- well,
not everything,

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
but most things in the mystery
school tradition are ancient.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, they've
been handed down

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
over thousands of years,
hundreds of years,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
depending on how long that
lineage has been around.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And they hand it down
through the oral tradition,

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:54.790 align:middle line:84%
meaning from mouth
to ear, right?

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.440 align:middle line:90%
And in person.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Why in person?

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy, yeah.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Resonant fields.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Entrainment, right?

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Auric space being shared.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, we can
teach online, and we

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:84%
can do these remote
things, but you

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:16.370 align:middle line:84%
miss the energy when you do this
sort of remote thing, right?

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
There's something different
when people gather together

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
in a space like
this and we share,

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
and the voice directly
impacts the body,

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and the energies mix and meld.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a multi-dimensional
experience

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:84%
that happens in the
transmission of the keys

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and the teachings that's very
different from remote stuff

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
or online stuff or
self-study stuff.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:90%
And I found this, right?

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So I had explored lots
of different things.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.100 align:middle line:84%
All of it was my own
personal philosophy.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd take a little bit
here that resonates.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
The rest of it, the dogma,
I was, like, yeah, no.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go and
study the next thing,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and I'd take a little
bit that resonated,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and then I'd leave the rest.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'd find that with
everything I studied, I grew,

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:90%
and then I'd hit a plateau.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go look for the
next thing, and I'd grow,

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.957 align:middle line:90%
and I'd hit a plateau.

00:19:04.957 --> 00:19:07.010 align:middle line:84%
This was my self-study
process, but it

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:84%
was an important
process, and we'll get

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:90%
into that a little bit later.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.350 align:middle line:84%
But when I came to the mystery
school and I took that leap--

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and it really was a leap
of faith at the time.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew nobody,
other than the one

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
woman who had activated me, and
she didn't even remember me.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was just,
for the first time,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.110 align:middle line:84%
going and doing something
completely on my own,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
following it totally
in faith, and had

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:84%
no idea what I was getting
myself into on the first day.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.210 align:middle line:84%
It was really interesting,
the first day I show up,

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.043 align:middle line:84%
and they say, how many
of you-- and there's,

00:19:40.043 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:90%
like, 45 people in the room.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.000 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
know why you're here

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and what you're
getting this weekend?

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the
back of the room.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And there was two people who
raised their hands out of 45.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.312 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow.

00:19:53.312 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
And then they said,
how many of you

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:84%
have no idea why
you're here or what

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.310 align:middle line:84%
you're getting this weekend,
but your guides or something

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:00.158 align:middle line:84%
inside of you just said,
I have to be there?

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And everybody else
raised their hand.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I was like, whoa,
I'm not the only one.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is interesting.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:90%
So right away, I was intrigued.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And again, the teachings
challenged, but some of it

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
really made a lot of
sense and was things

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.920 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard before.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, what struck me the
most, again, was the energy.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.340 align:middle line:84%
There was no doubt
in my mind that there

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.695 align:middle line:84%
was something energetic
happening within this space.

00:20:27.695 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a
hotel room like this,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:90%
but there was something more.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I was a very
grounded, scientific person,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:90%
so I wasn't making it up.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't a placebo
effect for me,

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:90%
because I was very skeptical.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet, by the end
of that weekend,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I was high as a kite on energy.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, whoa,
OK, what is this?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was a feeling of
joy, full of joy, right?

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So initiation is
a key that really

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:84%
helps us to unlock our true
purpose, our true potential,

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and to accelerate, right?

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the big thing.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:10%
We can all get there, but when
we are doing it on our own,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.317 align:middle line:10%
trying to do
everything self-study--

00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:10%
or you know, maybe follow
this teacher for a while

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:10%
or that teacher for a while, but
not really commit to something.

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
It's like a maze, you know?

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Life is like a maze.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And you follow your
way through the maze,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.742 align:middle line:84%
but when you're on your own, you
don't know the map to the maze.

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
run into dead ends.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.492 align:middle line:10%
You're going to find a pitfall.

00:21:28.492 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:10%
You're going to wander
around for a long time

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:10%
before you find your way,
if you find your way.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you find a guide
who knows the map, who

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
knows which way to turn,
which way to avoid,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.420 align:middle line:84%
you can get your way
through the maze faster.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if I were to
say at the core of what

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:84%
kind of ancient
mystery traditions

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.900 align:middle line:84%
do is they give you the
map, they give you a guide,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and say, come on.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that they're--

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.100 align:middle line:84%
at least in the Western
mystery school tradition,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.170 align:middle line:84%
the teacher is not
better than you.

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:05.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't see themselves
as, like, the guru.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
They're more like, you
have the power within you.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
All I'm here to do
is help you unlock

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:90%
what's already inside of you.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Rather than give you my power,
it's the power's inside of you,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
so what do you need to do?

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've walked this path a
little bit longer than you

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.070 align:middle line:90%
have, so let me help you.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Let me guide you along
the way, and we'll

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:90%
walk this path together, right?

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.410 align:middle line:90%
We'll walk it together.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that, I liked that,
because I didn't really

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:84%
want to give my power
away to anybody or worship

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:90%
and bow down at anybody's feet.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to attain
my own empowerment.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to ancient
mystery school methods,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
the ancient mystery schools
have been on the planet

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.990 align:middle line:90%
for a long time, right?

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:90%
This used to be civilization.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Every tribe, every
society, every culture

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.830 align:middle line:84%
had spirituality, a
spiritual way of life,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:90%
woven into their way of life.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:90%
It was woven in.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And they might have had certain
people who were the workers,

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and you had others who were
the healers or the shamans

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
or the priests, and then you
had others who were the leaders,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.430 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So you had people dividing up
the tasks within that society,

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.970 align:middle line:84%
but everybody was ultimately
initiated into the teachings.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.370 align:middle line:90%
Everybody received initiation.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:27.500 align:middle line:84%
As children, they
received it, right?

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Rites of passage at
certain key stages in life.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:90%
And so this was a way of life.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And we can look
to, for example, we

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
have these ancient sacred sites
that are trying to memorialize,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.930 align:middle line:84%
help us remember, that
there's a mystery to life

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and that there's power
spots on the planet.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And many of those
mystery schools

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:90%
were done in those power spots.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So you have the
druids at Stonehenge.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:84%
You have the Greek and the
Elysian mysteries at Delphi.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:03.170 align:middle line:84%
You have the Mayan, and
this is Chichen Itza.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You have Eastern
traditions, right,

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.870 align:middle line:84%
as well, with the Tibetan and
the Daoist and the Buddhist

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
and the Yogic and the
Vedas and so forth.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, we have
the ancient Egyptian traditions,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.210 align:middle line:90%
which were quite--

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.020 align:middle line:84%
still, to this day,
there is a mystery.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.720 align:middle line:90%
How did they build that pyramid?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't buy the stories that the
mainstream Egyptologists try

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:90%
to feed you with slave labor.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.030 align:middle line:90%
And they say these are tombs.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.140 align:middle line:90%
These were not tombs.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
These were temples
of initiation, right?

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:90%
They were temples of initiation.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we enter into
the mystery schools.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And some might be trained to
become a priest or priestess.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Others might just be initiated
and then be sent off.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:50.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, your unique purpose
is, your gifts are this.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And so you go and you
learn to become a--

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you know, like in ancient Egypt,
some would become the stone

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:90%
carvers--

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.590 align:middle line:84%
you know, the people who made
the statues for the temples.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.620 align:middle line:84%
Others would become
the carpet weavers.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:84%
Others would become the ones
who scribed onto the papyrus

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:90%
and kept the records.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.150 align:middle line:84%
So everyone had something,
even basket weaving,

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.450 align:middle line:90%
but it was all a spiritual act.

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Every single one was working
that spiritual process

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:90%
into their life.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
gather, right?

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They'd have certain
key times of year

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that they would gather
together as a community,

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and they would celebrate.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And they would honor
the gods and goddesses,

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:84%
and they would celebrate with
each other in exchange and song

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and music and dance and ritual.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, in
particular, they were very--

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.075 align:middle line:84%
does anyone know what
was their key focus?

00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Transcending death, right?

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So they were very
focused on the afterlife.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So in ancient Egypt, in
mystery school, it was,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:84%
how can I live this life
now so that I have the best

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
chance possible of joining
the immortals, so to speak,

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.710 align:middle line:90%
in the afterlife?

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so they lived life
to the fullest with joy

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and doing good works and
contributing and so forth.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And then there's this big story
called "The Egyptian Story

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.350 align:middle line:84%
of the Dead" that
talks about-- so here's

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.160 align:middle line:84%
like the soul, the ba,
the soul of the being kind

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.880 align:middle line:90%
of leaving the body.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they have this
story of Thoth and Anubis

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and Maat and all
these Egyptian gods

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses, Isis and
Osiris, and they're presiding

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.895 align:middle line:90%
over the weighing of the heart.

00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have heard of
this weighing of the heart?

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, how many of
you are kind of, I

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.680 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what
you're talking about?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the weighing
of the heart.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:90%
So they had these scales, right?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Here's where-- I
can't use both hands.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:56.245 align:middle line:84%
They had these scales,
and as a soul traversed

00:26:56.245 --> 00:26:57.620 align:middle line:84%
through the
underworld, they were

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:84%
meant to be kind of purifying
themselves and letting

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.410 align:middle line:90%
go of attachments--

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.720 align:middle line:84%
you know, attachments from
life and wounding and stuff

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that was plaguing their soul
or weighing their soul down

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.340 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.257 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they get
through their journey

00:27:11.257 --> 00:27:12.710 align:middle line:84%
through the
underworld, they come

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to this procession
in the halls where

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the gods and goddesses of
ancient Egyptian pantheon

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.750 align:middle line:90%
are lining the walls.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And as they walk
through this hallway--

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and the light of these gods
is seeing right through them,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.960 align:middle line:84%
and in a way, it's like
a walk of repentance.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.210 align:middle line:84%
They're like, this is what
I did, and I'm so sorry.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But they're not they're
not asking for forgiveness

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:90%
from the gods.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They're forgiving
themselves, right?

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're relieving
their burden of their soul

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.110 align:middle line:90%
so that they can get to the end.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the end are
the scales of my Maat,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and Maat means justice,
truth, righteousness.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.638 align:middle line:84%
And they way the heart of
the soul, the person, which

00:27:52.638 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:90%
is really the seed of the soul.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
So they're weighing the soul
against the feather of Maat,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:90%
meaning the feather of truth.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:90%
So is your soul pure?

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Is your soul as
light as a feather?

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Did you live your
life in a true way?

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:11.000 align:middle line:84%
And when the soul weighed
in the balance, then

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.425 align:middle line:84%
they got to pass through the
portal and join the immortals.

00:28:14.425 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
They already are
immortal, right?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal beings.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So their soul then just
went up to that next level

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.290 align:middle line:90%
of progression.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
But when they
weighed heavy, they

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
had to kind of go back
and do a little bit

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:26.620 align:middle line:90%
more work on themselves--

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.745 align:middle line:84%
you know, whether we talk
about it as reincarnation

00:28:28.745 --> 00:28:30.162 align:middle line:84%
or we talk about
it, no, they just

00:28:30.162 --> 00:28:32.600 align:middle line:84%
went back in the underworld
and did more work

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.730 align:middle line:90%
to let go of their baggage.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So that they could get to that
point of being pure to go on

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So the Egyptians-- this is very
much a story of transformation.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And this story, while
it's about the afterlife,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:90%
it can be applied to this life.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Because how many
times in this life

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:57.050 align:middle line:84%
do we go through death
and rebirth, right?

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you have
felt your old self almost

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.358 align:middle line:90%
like that was a past life ago?

00:29:02.358 --> 00:29:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever experienced that?

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I've lived
already three or four lives

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:14.150 align:middle line:84%
in this life, and that's
because of initiation.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So here, in some of
these hieroglyphs,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.970 align:middle line:90%
you see the ankh, right?

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And the ankh is
about eternal life.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:22.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the meaning of it.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
So they're feeding the
ankh as a key of initiation

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to the pharaoh here as a
process of helping them

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:34.470 align:middle line:90%
awaken to their eternal life.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we kind of
move beyond the Egyptian,

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.570 align:middle line:84%
we also have the
Greeks, who adapted

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.920 align:middle line:84%
a lot of their traditions
from the Egyptians.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.220 align:middle line:90%
And here is like--

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.360 align:middle line:84%
the story in the
ancient Greek mysteries,

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.700 align:middle line:90%
they talk about the hero, right?

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the initiate
was to become a hero,

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and the way one
became a hero was

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.300 align:middle line:84%
to die without dying, meaning
to go like into a stasis state

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.068 align:middle line:84%
or to a visionary state, where
they laid their body down.

00:30:06.068 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, they maybe immersed
themselves in a dark cave

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.470 align:middle line:90%
for a while.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They did breathing exercises,
rituals, chants, and so forth

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
to put themselves
into an altered state.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And then they had a vision of
a journey into the underworld.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the underworld, they
met these two goddesses

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.490 align:middle line:84%
at some point,
and their task was

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to receive a
message, to be deemed

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:28.700 align:middle line:84%
worthy by those goddesses
to receive a message.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And then to return and
deliver that message

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.900 align:middle line:90%
to their community.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And when they accomplished that,
they defeated death, basically,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and they were seen as heroes.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.280 align:middle line:90%
They would come back as a hero.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And then you have more
modern-- like this

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:48.230 align:middle line:84%
is a Templar temple called the
Initiation Well in Portugal.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is symbolic
of the journey.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Initiation and the
process of fulfilling

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
our full potential,
full purpose,

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:84%
is a journey into the
depths of the self.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.203 align:middle line:84%
And it's also a
path, and it's a path

00:31:03.203 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:90%
that has many levels, right?

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
There's many grades of
initiation, for example.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, each
step on that path,

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:84%
we go through a whole alchemical
cycle of transformation.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So you receive an
initiation, for example,

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and that catalyzes a
transformational process

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.350 align:middle line:84%
within you that
we then have to go

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.990 align:middle line:84%
through the cycle of
that transformation

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and then prepare
ourselves to become ready

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.800 align:middle line:90%
for that next step.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that next
step catalyzes

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
another transformation
and so on and so forth.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a spiral, right?

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Because each cycle
through and each step,

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
it takes us up to another
octave, another level higher.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
the symbolism here.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, like I said,
initiation, from

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.970 align:middle line:84%
the scientific perspective,
it's a little hard

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:90%
to describe how it works.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But I can say that it does
work, especially when it's

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:90%
in a true lineage, right?

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple things
to the power of initiation.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's about
helping you achieve

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.010 align:middle line:84%
your own full potential,
your own divinity,

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:12.210 align:middle line:84%
becoming like the godlike human
in the hermetic tradition.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Hermes Trismegistus
said that humans

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.410 align:middle line:90%
were made with two natures--

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:90%
mortal and divine.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So mortal and immortal,
physical and spiritual.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And because of
these two natures,

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:84%
we were deemed or
ordained, meaning

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.150 align:middle line:84%
initiated, to be
greater than the gods,

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:84%
like the angels and so
forth, who only have

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.470 align:middle line:90%
one nature, which is spiritual.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So it's harder for us having
these two natures, right?

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it gives us
even greater potential

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.560 align:middle line:90%
than what we even realize.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to be so
caught up in our humanness,

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.920 align:middle line:84%
thinking we're small,
thinking we're incapable,

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.230 align:middle line:90%
thinking we lack.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.680 align:middle line:90%
But the truth is, we don't.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.480 align:middle line:90%
We don't lack.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing that bothers
us or gets in our way is

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.810 align:middle line:90%
our mind, is our thinking.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And so in the mystery
school traditions,

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:10.340 align:middle line:84%
it's, like, 95% of
your enlightenment

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.720 align:middle line:84%
or your attainment, your
individuation process,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.085 align:middle line:90%
comes from your own work.

00:33:16.085 --> 00:33:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It comes from your efforts.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It comes from you
unlocking what's

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.120 align:middle line:84%
inside of you and you taking
that and applying it, you

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:84%
following your intuition and
really taking those actions.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And the other 5%
is, here's a key.

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Use this tool.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.080 align:middle line:90%
Here is a tool for empowerment.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Now go use it.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Here's just a little bit of
help to speed up your process,

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to turn on those keys that
are already inside of you,

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.460 align:middle line:84%
because we have our
blind spots, right?

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And so when we have a
blind spot on our own,

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.140 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to see past that.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the mystery
school traditions

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.430 align:middle line:84%
are about giving you those
keys that amount to the 5%

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
to help you more quickly
turn on that potential.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it's up to
you to do the rest,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.950 align:middle line:84%
right, to walk the path,
to apply it, to live it,

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:84%
to integrate it, and to
awaken what's inside of you.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.540 align:middle line:90%
And yet, that 5% is important.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:16.099 align:middle line:90%
And traditionally, that 5%--

00:34:16.099 --> 00:34:18.830 align:middle line:84%
you know, those keys
and then the guidance

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.880 align:middle line:84%
of how to more quickly
fully realize it--

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.469 align:middle line:84%
there have been
times on the planet

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.050 align:middle line:84%
where it's been
open and available.

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.179 align:middle line:84%
And there have been
other times on the planet

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.570 align:middle line:84%
where it was down
underground, and it

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.810 align:middle line:90%
was secret society stuff.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.060 align:middle line:90%
But why secret?

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I would say
there's two reasons.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:84%
One, there were
times on the planet

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:47.030 align:middle line:84%
when people were empowered and
flourishing and everybody had

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.949 align:middle line:84%
certain level of
independence and ability

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:50.909 align:middle line:84%
to attain their own
potential and purpose.

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.548 align:middle line:84%
And there were other people
who were certain powers

00:34:53.548 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that be that didn't like that,
they wanted to control people,

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:56.890 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So they had witch
hunts and inquisitions,

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and they drove this
stuff underground.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:90%
They had genocides.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.680 align:middle line:84%
They almost eliminated,
and they did

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.510 align:middle line:84%
succeed at eliminating some of
the lineages off the planet.

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So those lineages
that survived needed

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:17.060 align:middle line:84%
to go underground to
protect the lineage,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.090 align:middle line:84%
just to keep it alive for a
future time on the planet,

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
a future generation, when
we would be ready again,

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:30.350 align:middle line:84%
when the culture, the sort of
atmosphere of social norms,

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.620 align:middle line:84%
was more ready and
accepting to allow

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:84%
these empowerment
and these teachings,

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.310 align:middle line:84%
these alternative
teachings that go

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:90%
against some religious dogma.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:46.540 align:middle line:84%
They go against certain
political and various powers

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.800 align:middle line:90%
that be type interests.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're about
empowering the individual.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So there is one reason why
these things went underground.

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Another reason is
there is true power.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.520 align:middle line:90%
There is true power.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's deep knowledge, and
there's tools that really work.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And we humans, we have this
thing called an ego, right?

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:12.310 align:middle line:84%
When our ego grabs hold
of certain knowledge

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and certain tools, if we don't
stay humble and in integrity

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
with that tradition and in its
leaders, who are helping guide

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:27.250 align:middle line:84%
us forward, we tend to take
that knowledge and that power

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
and use it towards egoic means.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So these two things--
sometimes they had to preserve

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.300 align:middle line:90%
the lineage just to keep--

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.400 align:middle line:84%
because people were
getting too egotistical

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:90%
about its applications.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is self-defeating
when we go into that.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And then the initiation--

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and every initiation amplifies
your flow of energy tenfold.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.400 align:middle line:84%
True initiation
in ancient lineage

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.203 align:middle line:84%
amplifies your flow
of energy tenfold.

00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know, we
can say, well, we

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.210 align:middle line:84%
have access to infinite amount
of energy, and that's true.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But we tend to filter
that off, right?

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.220 align:middle line:84%
As it comes in, we're not ready
for that full amount of flow,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.080 align:middle line:84%
so we funnel it off
and it comes down,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.282 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like a
trickle for most people.

00:37:07.282 --> 00:37:08.740 align:middle line:84%
If your central
core-- if you think

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
of your central
core, most people,

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.360 align:middle line:84%
it's maybe the
width of a pencil.

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And initiation kind of stretches
and expands that central core

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.210 align:middle line:84%
energy flow 10 times more,
10 times more, 10 times more

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
with each initiation
that you take.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But it's a gradual
process of being

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:32.150 align:middle line:84%
able to open up and harness and
integrate that flow more fully.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So these initiations, as
they open up that flow more,

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.640 align:middle line:90%
more energy starts coming in.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you also receive
tools and teachings and things

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.920 align:middle line:84%
that help you, OK, here's
how to go and take it

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.180 align:middle line:90%
into application.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Only when you take it into
application can you really

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
integrate that full 10
times the flow and can

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:90%
you really learn to harness it.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like if you're
going to become a fitness buff

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
go run a marathon

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.152 align:middle line:84%
or do the Iron Man or
something like that.

00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.735 align:middle line:84%
You have to train
and train and train,

00:38:01.735 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to exercise
those muscles, right?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if you
stop exercising the muscles?

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.950 align:middle line:90%
You atrophy.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:90%
You atrophy.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So certain spiritual
tools and methods

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:16.240 align:middle line:84%
are like spiritual exercise
to strengthen the muscles.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it has to
become a way of life

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.430 align:middle line:84%
so that we can continue to
maintain and integrate that

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than kind of lose
that edge, so to speak,

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:29.200 align:middle line:84%
when we stop doing
the good practices.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So the initiations catalyze.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.900 align:middle line:90%
They accelerate.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I've found that initiation
accelerates our progression

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.400 align:middle line:84%
through life and the
lessons we're here to learn.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.720 align:middle line:90%
It all speeds up, right?

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.670 align:middle line:84%
When I got initiated
that first step,

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:45.190 align:middle line:84%
life started speeding
up in a big way.

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got
initiated the second step,

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:84%
my service started to
speed up in a big way.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And that service is a big
piece, because we're not just

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:90%
here for ourselves.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
We're all in this
world together.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We're all meant to be
creating a better world,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.020 align:middle line:84%
but that's not going to happen
if we're not doing it together.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is all a
metamorphosis process

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:11.890 align:middle line:84%
that we are meant to transform
from humans, being just

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.400 align:middle line:84%
in the caterpillar stage,
eating off the fat of the Earth,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:22.240 align:middle line:84%
and transform, metamorphosize,
into the butterfly, where

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.350 align:middle line:84%
we can really bring beauty
and manifest our full divine

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.390 align:middle line:90%
potential into this world.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And do it together, right?

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Do it together.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:84%
So what emerges as a
result of these initiations

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:84%
is greater sense of
connection to who you really

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.420 align:middle line:84%
are, greater sense of
connection to the divine planes.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Actually, more access to
multiple planes of causation,

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:47.440 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So you learn the tools, and
through the initiations,

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.470 align:middle line:84%
it's like you gain the
power, or maybe even

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual
authority, to access

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.210 align:middle line:84%
more directly those higher
planes of causation.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.010 align:middle line:90%
So magic.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, we talk
about magic a lot.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And magic is-- you
know, what we used

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.250 align:middle line:84%
to call magic today is science,
and what we call magic today,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow will be science.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And so magic is
very real and is all

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:20.200 align:middle line:84%
about how our consciousness can
be directed by will, hopefully

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.780 align:middle line:84%
aligned with the divine
will, and we direct that

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
into the world to
make things happen.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So changing from nothing
to something, something

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:84%
to something else, creation
and transformation,

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.500 align:middle line:84%
this is like a good
definition of magic.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And so we're about
learning that,

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.000 align:middle line:84%
how to be truly players in the
game rather than just pawns,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:41.800 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just being kind of
pushed this way and that way

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.670 align:middle line:84%
by the will of the
world, we're learning

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
to harness our own will and
become empowered in who we are

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.470 align:middle line:84%
and what we're
really here to do.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:57.150 align:middle line:84%
But that requires some courage
to step out of the norm, right?

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.068 align:middle line:90%
That requires overcoming fears.

00:41:00.068 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:84%
That was one of my biggest
things, was like, oh my god,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
what are they going to
think of me if I come out

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.720 align:middle line:90%
and just declare who I am?

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:10.170 align:middle line:84%
What if I continue
to pursue this PhD

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:11.760 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't do
anything with it?

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Or I step off the track
of what I was trained for?

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, all
these things that we worry

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.880 align:middle line:84%
about in terms of what
other people think,

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and the fears of whether
we're good enough,

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:90%
whether we can really do it.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.650 align:middle line:84%
All of these ways that
we keep ourselves small,

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.643 align:middle line:84%
those layers need
to be peeled off.

00:41:30.643 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
big things that we

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:34.590 align:middle line:84%
do in the path of
initiation, is we

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
work to peel off those
layers that block us

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.860 align:middle line:84%
so that we can allow that
inner beauty, that inner glory,

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:46.090 align:middle line:84%
that inner light to just shine
through and make things happen.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all,
ultimately, an alchemical,

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:52.080 align:middle line:84%
spiritual alchemical,
process about becoming

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:84%
that Philosopher's Stone,
becoming that Adam Kadmon, that

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.030 align:middle line:90%
perfected human.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And today, we might even call
it becoming a galactic human,

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:07.830 align:middle line:84%
where we are connected to
the stars and the cosmos

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:90%
and the Milky Way.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're aware of that,
and we know how our thoughts

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and how our actions send
ripples throughout the universe.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.417 align:middle line:90%
Now, I promise you--

00:42:18.417 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's a couple of things
I want to get to before the end

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:21.800 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So one thing, there's
self-initiation.

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Self-initiation is that moment
in your life where you say,

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I have a purpose.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I know that there's
more to life than this,

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:34.920 align:middle line:90%
and I want to fulfill it.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even realize
it was animated.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.290 align:middle line:90%
You know, I have light.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.180 align:middle line:84%
So self-initiation
is that moment where

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.672 align:middle line:90%
we say, OK, I'm committed.

00:42:48.672 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And not just do I
think I have a purpose.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm committed to fulfilling it.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm committed to taking those
steps to really figure out

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.233 align:middle line:84%
what it is and how
I'm going to do it.

00:42:56.233 --> 00:42:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give you a
tool right now to support you,

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:00.060 align:middle line:90%
because all of you, you're here.

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
You've already
self-initiated, most likely.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And I want to give you a tool
to help you call in more energy.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
stand up real quick.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to put the
microphone down for this,

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:12.512 align:middle line:84%
so I'll try to just
yell really loud.

00:43:12.512 --> 00:43:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.465 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do something
here called the calling upon.

00:43:19.465 --> 00:43:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
hand this down.

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.480 align:middle line:84%
This is a ritual from my lineage
that I'm to hand down to you.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.097 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy, and
yet, it's very powerful.

00:43:26.097 --> 00:43:26.930 align:middle line:90%
And it really works.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.388 align:middle line:84%
And you can do it
any time you want

00:43:28.388 --> 00:43:32.150 align:middle line:84%
to call in support from
the spiritual realms

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.215 align:middle line:90%
to help you here.

00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.340 align:middle line:90%
You want to hold it for me?

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.190 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.607 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, first of
all, you're going

00:43:36.607 --> 00:43:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to put your index
fingers and your thumbs

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.052 align:middle line:84%
and your hands in
a triangle form.

00:43:43.052 --> 00:43:45.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to put your thumbs
right on your belly button,

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:90%
your hands flat on your belly.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to say,
I am, and your name.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I am Theresa Bullard, right?

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to bring
it up above your third eye,

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
look up through it.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to say,
I call upon Father Sky.

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.057 align:middle line:90%
>> I call upon Father Sky.

00:44:02.057 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And now you're going to bring
your hands apart a little bit

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and kind of make a loop
and bring it to the heart.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:10%
You're kind of sending
it to your heart.

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:12.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
which hand's in.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:16.594 align:middle line:84%
And say, to come down
and join Mother Earth.

00:44:16.594 --> 00:44:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> To come down and
join Mother Earth.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And now give
yourself a little hug.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.430 align:middle line:90%
Slide your hands down your arms.

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.531 align:middle line:84%
To come down for the benefit
of the children of light.

00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> To come down for the benefit
of the children of light.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And then here, you could add
a personal intention statement.

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.960 align:middle line:10%
So let's do the whole
thing again, OK?

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So hands flat on your belly,
thumbs touching, index fingers

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.030 align:middle line:90%
touching, forming that triangle.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.580 align:middle line:90%
I am and your name.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:44.430 align:middle line:84%
I am-- hands up
above your third eye.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Look through it.

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:46.980 align:middle line:90%
I call upon Father Sky.

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I call upon Father Sky.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Make the loop.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.600 align:middle line:84%
To come down and
join Mother Earth.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.800 align:middle line:10%
>> To come down and
join Mother Earth.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Give yourself a little hug.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.438 align:middle line:84%
For the benefit of
the children of light.

00:44:57.438 --> 00:44:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>> For the benefit of
the children of light.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the benefit of
helping me fulfill my purpose.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And for the benefit of
helping me fulfill my purpose.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you can say amen
or something, so be it.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So this is just a quick thing.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's the downward triangle,
upward triangle, and then

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
you're making a little infinity
loop, so the as above, so

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:90%
below.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So there's sacred geometry
that goes into it.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.490 align:middle line:90%
There's words that go into it.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.170 align:middle line:84%
It is important to
speak it out loud,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.250 align:middle line:84%
because your voice impacts
the physical world.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:31.430 align:middle line:90%
But it can be soft.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:33.890 align:middle line:84%
You can softly speak it, but
it does make a difference

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:35.090 align:middle line:90%
to speak, right?

00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.820 align:middle line:90%
They say all magic is spoken.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And the words and the hand
movements and the intention,

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:43.730 align:middle line:90%
it's all a formula.

00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is an example, a really
simple example, of a ritual.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:53.420 align:middle line:84%
Beyond self-initiation,
there's ways

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.670 align:middle line:84%
that we can have a
spiritual experience that

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.710 align:middle line:90%
might initiate us in a new way.

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
physical initiation.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:04.190 align:middle line:84%
And physical initiation
is a direct transfer

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.610 align:middle line:84%
in the lineage from the
guide to the initiate.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And you are initiated
into the lineage

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:11.660 align:middle line:84%
of all those who've
come before you,

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:90%
all those who've come before.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everyone.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:16.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:20.320 align:middle line:90%
