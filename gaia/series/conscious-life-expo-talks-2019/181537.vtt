00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:05.605 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Will you please give a very
warm and wonderful welcome

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.290 align:middle line:90%
for Mr. Emery Smith?

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.762 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you ready
to rock and roll?

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I got to use the
bathroom real quick.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start by telling
everybody how I met Emery.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I've known Emery--
he just reminded me--

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.160 align:middle line:90%
since 2007.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:10%
I was a consultant on the film
"Sirius" with Dr. Michael--

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Steven Greer.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And we were down in
Crestone, Colorado.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was reminding you, when
I met you guys running around

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
the desert out there,
and I was just there

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to watch the filming
of this documentary.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm watching Emery,
who's giving his 150%.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.685 align:middle line:84%
You did the photographing
of the two UFOs

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
that I showed this morning.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.735 align:middle line:84%
And we had a lot of cameras
at that time because it

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:10.735 align:middle line:90%
was going to be a movie.

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> 17.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought he was
there as an assistant.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the-- because
he didn't talk about it.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is how I met Emery.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And later on as a journalist, I
think it was a year and a half

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.240 align:middle line:90%
ago when his story came out.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:90%
I already knew him.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:84%
And I was also part
of the Atacama being

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
because I am the one that
arranged for Emery and Dr.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Greer to go to Barcelona
because I have contacts

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.657 align:middle line:84%
And I knew the woman
that was picking them up.

00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew they were
going to the hospital.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And I helped with
all that because I'm

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
kind of the bridge
with all this stuff.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The autopsy would have--

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA extraction that
I did, by the way, assisted

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
by my colleagues, would
never have happened

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.574 align:middle line:90%
if it wasn't for Paola Harris.

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:11.822 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And Emery will
probably tell you,

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
he's the one doing the actual
extraction of the tissue

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
because he's the medical person
that was doing it, wasn't it?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with two emergency
room surgeons though.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:90%
But they wanted me to do it.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:90%
>> They wanted you to do it.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.247 align:middle line:90%
>> I wonder why.

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:90%
I get harassed about this.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.275 align:middle line:84%
>> But yeah, but anyway,
he's the one that--

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
it's his hands that
are doing that.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's my
background with Emery.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I did an article on him
that went viral in my magazine,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
"XTimes," in Rome,
two articles on you.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Italians know
about this case.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a case for me
because I'm a journalist.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very honored, Emery, to
have a conversation with you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
right now here at the
Consciousness Life Expo.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
It's my honor to ask
you the questions

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that everybody else
here wants answered.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But as I heard him this
morning, how many people

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
heard Emery on the
panel this morning?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.565 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow.

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
He started out, and I
was thinking to myself,

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I hope he repeats what
he says because he

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
didn't just spontaneously
combust and cut him out

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:90%
of the woodwork.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
You started with your
background, Emery.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
You started with how
you got into this,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and how your family was
in the armed forces,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.260 align:middle line:84%
all different branches
of the armed forces.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with that.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:84%
In your early days, you
had mentioned contact.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you mentioned wanting
to go into the armed forces.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
You want to start that way.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was around
seven years old,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
living on a
self-sustainable farm--

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Plainfield,
New Jersey, by the way,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and grew up in that area.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.260 align:middle line:84%
We moved and bought
a farm-- my family

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:84%
did-- in Southern Florida,
a self-sustainable farm.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
My dad said, if you can't
make it, we don't need it.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was a mechanic and
an electrical engineer.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:90%
So I got to learn really quick.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
I was the one changing all
the oil and all the tractors

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.820 align:middle line:84%
at age 9, and also
learning how to change out

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:84%
piston rings at age
10, and also learning

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.319 align:middle line:84%
how to make solar panels,
and things like that.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So I was-- my mom and dad
were really educational

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
for me starting, basically,
at a very, very young age.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I was visited,
around the time that--

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:84%
what year did "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind" come out?

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:90%
Was that '70--

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Around '78.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> '78, I think.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It was around that time.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.940 align:middle line:90%
I was called outside.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And I've been known for
sleepwalking and stuff.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
But I was actually
watching TV or something.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't normal--
it was very normal for me

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
to go out in the farm at night.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.835 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't very late.

00:04:59.835 --> 00:05:01.470 align:middle line:90%
It was probably 9:00, 9:30.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:90%
I remember walking outside.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:90%
And I went out on the dock.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:10%
We had a little 20-foot dock
that went out on this lake,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:10%
like a one acre lake.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And this craft just came
right on down, just big disk.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And there was
three people in it.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was like, this
communication came through.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't really
understand it.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it just
enfolded in itself,

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:90%
and dematerialized, and left.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't scared.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
It was a very beautiful feeling
with this very beautiful

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:90%
bluish green light.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%
And I walked back inside.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my parents, I just
saw this craft over the lake.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.755 align:middle line:90%
And they looked at each other.

00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And they said, OK, just
don't talk about it [LAUGHS]

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.220 align:middle line:90%
to anyone.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.360 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
So they knew something
that I didn't know.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
But on their deathbeds,
they did tell me a lot

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the few weeks before
they had passed away.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And I got a lot of it on film.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, why didn't
you guys ever tell me

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.620 align:middle line:90%
about all this?

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:90%
They go, well, you never asked.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very educational
experience for me,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
growing up on this
farm, and running around

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
in my cut-off jean shorts,
and feeding all the animals,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and always being grounded,
or up and in a tree.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
I liked being up in the trees.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:90%
And that was fun.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think that had a lot to
do with where I wanted to go.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So at age 13, I joined
Civil Air Patrol,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
which is a auxiliary of
the Air Force for kids

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
who may or may not want
to go into the military

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And you get an advanced
rank if you go in,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.140 align:middle line:84%
if you serve in Civil
Air Patrol for this.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So at age 13, I joined
Civil Air Patrol

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.200 align:middle line:90%
and was flying planes at age 15.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, from there, I
also joined the Army ROTC.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And the Army gave
me a scholarship

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:84%
to fly helicopters,
which I turned down

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.510 align:middle line:90%
because I saw "Top Gun."

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, my
dad was in the Navy.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather was in the Army.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.620 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going Air Forces.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:90%
That sounds cool, Air Force.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want to fly
in an F-15 Eagle.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.590 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time--

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:84%
some of you guys already
heard this story.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:90%
It was on the panel.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
I just love biology,
whether it's human, animal,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.205 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a
farm, giving birth

00:07:37.205 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to animals, and all this stuff.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I
was playing soccer.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And the shoes were so tight.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I had a big wide
foot that I kept

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
getting these ingrown toenails.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.190 align:middle line:90%
I'd go to the podiatrist.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you may want to
turn around for this, son.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I said why?

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.772 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:84%
He's like, I'm going to
have to numb your foot.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.788 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have to
take your toenail off.

00:08:03.788 --> 00:08:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow, this is cool.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:90%
I said, do it.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.050 align:middle line:90%
So he did it.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And I watched it.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.345 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
it inspired me.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Like, wow, you just took
all that pain away from me

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.842 align:middle line:90%
by taking my toenail off.

00:08:15.842 --> 00:08:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can play soccer
again and get this

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.270 align:middle line:90%
done six months later again.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
And what's funny is--

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and I never talked about this.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
When I got out of
the military, I

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.907 align:middle line:84%
developed this a platelet
rich plasma system.

00:08:31.907 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It was patented, the first
patented platelet rich plasma

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:84%
system and the first
stem cell concentrator.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can look it up and
see all my patents I've done.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I ended up 10, 15 years later
meeting the doctor, when

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.670 align:middle line:84%
I was 13, taking
my toenails off,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
and he started using
my platelet rich plasma

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:90%
concentrator for diabetic care.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And he had to go through
my course to get certified.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't make this up.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:90%
So it was very funny.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, I joined
the military at age 18--

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I was registered two
years ahead of time--

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and went into a special
medical program.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with
surgical technology.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:90%
They call it the--

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:84%
at that time, it was called
a surgical apprenticeship

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.480 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And that led me into also
being an EMT, and also

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:90%
being a surgical first assist.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
For you guys, before
there were RNFAs,

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they were using
technicians in the military

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
for the surgical first
assisting in every aspect

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.580 align:middle line:84%
from eye surgery,
GYN, to open heart.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a really
good understanding.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
10 different ways how to
remove an appendix because I

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
worked with 10
different surgeons.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:84%
10 different-- 10
different cardiologists,

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
10 different heart surgeons
harvesting the saphenous vein

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and doing bypass graft surgery,
all this kind of things.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I became an instructor
for them, for the military,

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.440 align:middle line:84%
for these cadets
and these students.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.575 align:middle line:84%
And I was asked to
do a moonlighting

00:10:14.575 --> 00:10:18.110 align:middle line:90%
job, my moonlighting position.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't too explicit
of what I was doing.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But they said, I would be
doing some organ harvesting.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So I thought I was
signing up to do

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
organ harvesting for fallen
soldiers that have almost

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.720 align:middle line:90%
passed away.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.345 align:middle line:84%
But they're still--
they're brain dead.

00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But we take their
organs, and then

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
use them for other soldiers
that could need them,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:90%
or for civilians.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And that definitely
was not the case.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
I was getting pieces
of tissue samples

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that did not look like
human tissue, whatsoever.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you question
it at all, Emery?

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I sure-- well, the thing
is there's this long drawn out

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.220 align:middle line:84%
process for the security, number
one, to get into these things,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and a huge book that
you're not going to read,

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:13.640 align:middle line:90%
but you have to sign it.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.790 align:middle line:90%
It's like an NDA.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I just
remember, the top 10 of them,

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
was you're not allowed
to ask anything

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
about the sample, where it
came from, or anything else.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If we tell you to
go in here and take

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.190 align:middle line:84%
a sample of the
tendon, or the muscle,

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
or whatever they want me
to do, that's all you do.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.118 align:middle line:84%
And you put it in a special
sealed nitrogen Vacutainer

00:11:39.118 --> 00:11:40.285 align:middle line:90%
and put it through the wall.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:42.090 align:middle line:90%
[PHONE RINGING]

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.745 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.745 --> 00:11:51.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we put it
through the wall.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And you don't get to
really know anything,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.432 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning phase because
they're testing you out.

00:11:58.432 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
We'll make sure you're going
to keep your mouth shut.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.557 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to go
home, and talk about it

00:12:02.557 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:90%
to your dormmates, and whatnot.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was really good
at keeping secrets.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, I mean,
blood didn't bother you.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Surgery didn't bother you.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
You weren't freaked
out by anything.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I mean, everyone--

00:12:17.366 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand,
growing up on a farm,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
you're getting cut up.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And you get injured a
lot is what I'll say.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:90%
So blood was not a big deal.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle line:84%
But I do remember through
my medical training,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
the first case they put me
in was a pilonidal cyst.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:40.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
How many people
know what that is?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I'll just have to
say, it has to do

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:90%
with the buttocks and the anus.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.350 align:middle line:90%
And there's a giant thing there.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And we cut it with a laser.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And it exploded over everyone.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.350 align:middle line:90%
And everyone started vomiting.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I just walked
outside and fainted.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like,
there was no blood.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
It was just putrid.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So then that wakes
you up pretty quick.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500 align:middle line:90%
And then you go back in.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
You get up.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:90%
And you go back.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:16.890 align:middle line:90%
And you do your thing.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
And then you get used to it.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.145 align:middle line:84%
And you're numb
to all this stuff.

00:13:20.145 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Emergency surgery, we're
sitting there operating.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Someone's bleeding out,
a lot of suicide victims.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
I remember one guy came in, an
Asian guy, he cut his wrist.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:90%
He cut his throat.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And he cut his ankles.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.112 align:middle line:90%
And he was on the table.

00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And stabbed-- the last thing
he did is took the sword

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and stabbed himself
in the heart.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
And he came in.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And we opened up the chest.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And the nurses, one of the
nurses started freaking out.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And she was new to
the trauma surgery.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor and I were
working, doing our thing.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.140 align:middle line:84%
But it was messing the
energy up of the team there

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
because she was
screaming, actually.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor just stopped, and
looked up, and said, everyone,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.027 align:middle line:90%
this is not you on the table.

00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So everyone took a deep breath,
and everything was fine.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:90%
And it worked out.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's go on to--

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and by the way,
could you tell us

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
what year you started doing
these other tissue samples?

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I joined the military
on August 7, 1990,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:90%
the United States Air Force.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I was part of Desert Storm,
Desert Shield, of course.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:84%
I belonged to an air
transportable hospital,

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
A-10 base, England Air
Force Base in Louisiana.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And shortly after that,
I was transferred over

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
to Kirtland Air Force
Base, Albuquerque, New

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Mexico because they
closed that base down.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Our air transportable hospital
is basically deployed anywhere

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.200 align:middle line:90%
in the world with two C-130s.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And we can set up
a city in 24 hours

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.803 align:middle line:90%
and a full-functioning hospital.

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:90%
So I was part of that.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I was a field medic.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
We were stationed, that
group was stationed

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:84%
30 miles north of Riyadh during
the Desert Storm, Desert Shield

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.128 align:middle line:90%
era.

00:15:17.128 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to describe
Kirtland when you got there?

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.237 align:middle line:84%
You said the base
was closed down.

00:15:21.237 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, that was England
Air Force Base, Louisiana,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:90%
with the A-10s.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Then I got to go over to
Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was working jointly
with the VA medical center

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and the actual military
hospital are connected.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So we were basically serving
the military and the VA,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
which are two separate
entities but connected.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I became
one of the managing

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.070 align:middle line:84%
indirectly about
20, 25 technicians

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and surgical first assistants.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was also a
training facility

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.520 align:middle line:84%
where they would
send a dozen students

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
over to learn how to
do surgical technology

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and surgical first assisting.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was managing
that temporarily.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
was approached--

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --for moonlighting.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --for the moonlighting job.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --moonlighting job,
the job, the extra job.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So describe a little bit,
the facility, and then

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:90%
your first impact.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, number one,
where I had to go,

00:16:27.532 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
I thought was going to be
at the hospital, of course,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:90%
where I always go.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.330 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:90%
It was on base.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
It was actually
inside Sandia Labs,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
which is a base within a base,
which goes down very deep,

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
by the way, many levels, and
very high security, three

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
or four different
security sections

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:90%
you have to go through.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
close to my dorm,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:51.460 align:middle line:84%
so I could bike
there or walk there.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And what would
happen is you would

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.700 align:middle line:84%
go to this-- it looked like
a fire tower, to be honest.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
entry point first.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
So you'd get in these elevators,
and go down just a few floors.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:90%
And you would check in.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:90%
You have a little badge.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And they do-- they already had
retinal scans, and handprint,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.660 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff too.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:90%
They

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Had these dogs that were there
that were really fascinating.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And they could smell things,
like viruses, or bacteria

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.377 align:middle line:90%
on you, or chemicals.

00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were trained for
this because they didn't

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:90%
want to infect anything that--

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
down below because it
could be catastrophic,

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:90%
bringing in these things.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.720 align:middle line:84%
You go through the special
sterilization rooms

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and get zapped.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you change
out into your suits.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And you have a little--

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
what you guys would
think was an iPad.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was in
1992, by the way.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:90%
But it was see-through.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:90%
It was clear.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It accepted this little
round disk, like a little CD.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Remember the little CD-ROMs?

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Those little CDs, you know?

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if anyone
uses those anymore.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
But it was like a little
CD, and it popped in.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And it told you where
you're going, what floor.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.920 align:middle line:90%
And the floors were all colored.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's white.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything's white and seamless.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.970 align:middle line:84%
But they all have these really
fiberoptic lines in them.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So I might be in operating room
Red 46 or Pink 72 that day.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.533 align:middle line:90%
And I was always escorted.

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And we had these
little wristbands

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:90%
they put on when you get there.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.430 align:middle line:90%
You're always being tracked.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.450 align:middle line:90%
So you can't go off the course.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:84%
You follow your line
to where you're going.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.130 align:middle line:84%
No one knows-- you
don't know what's

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:84%
going on in the operating
room next to you.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:90%
These are all vacuum sealed.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So there's two
compartmentalized areas

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:84%
before you go
inside these things.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.550 align:middle line:84%
So first, you have to put
this suit on, by the way.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And it has its own biometric
system inside of it

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
that measures my heart
rate, and my blood pressure,

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
and if I'm sweating, or
if I'm getting nervous.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And there was one time I did
get a little weirded out when

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:90%
I first saw my first full body.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.608 align:middle line:90%
And they're like Smith, you OK?

00:19:20.608 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, man, they
know my heart rate's up.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's like a lie detector.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.340 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, deep breath.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh yeah, I'm fine.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you might want to
elaborate your full body

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.930 align:middle line:90%
of an extraterrestrial, right?

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> My first full body
extraterrestrial, correct.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And can you, I mean, without
going into any gory details,

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:84%
could you tell us
what that looked like?

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was obviously
deceased, right?

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:90%
It was deceased, of course.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
All the specimens I
got were deceased.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.421 align:middle line:84%
I didn't (CHUCKLING) cut
open a live anything.

00:20:05.421 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:90%
That would be horrific.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.590 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I did take a sample.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.930 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this was
a small 4-foot being.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:84%
It was mesomorphic,
we would call,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.800 align:middle line:84%
in body somatotypes,
which is like

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
a small little bodybuilder.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:90%
And it was blue.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:90%
And it had very big eyes.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:90%
And it had very long hair.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And it had very, very
small hands and feet.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Describe the hair.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:90%
What was the hair like?

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.500 align:middle line:90%
>> The hair was black.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:90%
And it was very, very thick.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And you know I've
done lots of these

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:84%
because I explained different
ones, like I did earlier today.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was going in there just
to take out one of the organs.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's surprising is they
all have a head and two arms,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and two legs.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought,
after a couple of these,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.830 align:middle line:84%
that maybe they're just
growing these things.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're clones.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Or I wasn't really sure
they were extraterrestrial.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't allowed to ask
until later on down the road.

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
So that led me, of course,
going home at night,

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:90%
going what is going on?

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:90%
What are they making?

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And I can't say anything.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine being exposed
to something and you're not

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:90%
allowed to say what is this?

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
How did you get it?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
So it does-- it messes with you.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.810 align:middle line:84%
But thank goodness I
kept my mouth shut.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And later on during
the projects,

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I was able to see craft
as well and more bodies.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And also live beings.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I got to meet live
extraterrestrials that would

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:84%
work hand-in-hand with me,
that were types of surgeons.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
exciting moment.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so you started
with tissue samples.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And you went on to
the full bodied.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they
began to trust you.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Is that why you went
on to different levels?

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, every quarter,
how well you perform,

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and how often you really
wanted to be there--

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
it's up to you, by the way.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not like you have to.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
You actually volunteered
and signed the paper.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.060 align:middle line:84%
But they're very lenient because
they go through a lot of people

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:39.370 align:middle line:84%
because not everyone
can keep it shut.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, just
to clear the air,

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.730 align:middle line:84%
a couple of my
colleagues on the show

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.820 align:middle line:84%
have said, oh, well, Emery
Smith did 3,000 autopsies

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:90%
on 3,000 different ETs.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I could do 28
specimens, just pieces

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:84%
of meat, pieces of muscle,
pieces of brain or material

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.720 align:middle line:90%
in one day.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like
I had all those--

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:90%
those were not all full bodies.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a misleading thing
you hear online about me.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:90%
These were just tissue samples.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I've only maybe seen,
maybe, 300, 350 full bodies,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.610 align:middle line:84%
or torsos, or whatever,
different parts of the bodies.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the progression of the
chronology of this is then it

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.572 align:middle line:90%
has to go somewhere.

00:23:31.572 --> 00:23:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And you also said, I
think I remember you said,

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.330 align:middle line:90%
it paid well.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So you wanted to buy a
motorcycle, or something.

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:38.255 align:middle line:90%
That's why you continued.

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I was very young.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And I loved my job
working in the Air Force,

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:90%
doing all these amazing things.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And every time they
had an opportunity

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to take a class, or whatever,
and it was for free, of course,

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.470 align:middle line:84%
and I was signing
up for everything

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:03.110 align:middle line:84%
because I loved the
opportunity of education

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:middle line:90%
for free, number one.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And I also love to be part of
something that was classified.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
It was exciting.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.150 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, I wasn't
really that conscious enough,

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
at that moment, to really
grasp what was happening.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
I wanted-- I did it
because it was extra money.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I could have went off base
and worked at Burger King.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I probably shouldn't
have said that.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> No as exciting
as this, but yeah.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we're dealing with now
is a progression in your life

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
where, evidently,
you were trusted

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:84%
enough to go from the
autopsies to interaction.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to add
something as a researcher.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Somebody down the line must
have known you had contact.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And that you could
maybe interact.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they did because
after joining the auxiliary

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
of the Air Force at 13, I was
approached a lot right after

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And you do these ASVAB
tests, and things like this,

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:90%
to get into the military.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.137 align:middle line:84%
And it shows like, OK, this
guy would be good at mechanics.

00:25:21.137 --> 00:25:22.970 align:middle line:84%
This guy would be good
at scrubbing toilets.

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And this guy would be
good at mathematics.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And this guy would
be good as a pilot.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.400 align:middle line:90%
And I took that test.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.890 align:middle line:84%
But then, every month,
they would take me back

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
to MacDill Air Force Base
and say, my recruiter,

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is all
throughout my life saying,

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, we want to do
some more testing.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Would you be up for that?

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yeah, sure.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was cool because it had
to do with problem solving.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with
geometric shapes.

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with things that
I never really thought about.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>> IQ testing too, probably.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.050 align:middle line:84%
>> For sure, they were
probably doing this.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think they kind
of had a plan for me

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.055 align:middle line:84%
before I even knew
what was going on.

00:26:03.055 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Before you knew
were you were going.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they really talked
me out of the flying the jet,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.720 align:middle line:90%
which really upset me.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You wanted to be "Top Gun."

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:90%
We got that.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Because Tom Cruise was in the
jet, and he had the motorcycle.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted the
motorcycle and the jet.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.570 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you ever wish you
went down that path?

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I actually got to--

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Do that.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --fly small
planes, of course.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And I got to fly in a lot of
jets, T-38s, and F-16s, F-15s.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't the pilot.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You weren't "Top Gun."

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I wasn't "Top Gun."

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.970 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.020 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:90%
I did get a fast motorcycle.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I did have my own flight
suit, and I looked pretty cool.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, let's go
to-- because everything--

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.910 align:middle line:84%
everybody that is here, I think,
really wants to know people

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.800 align:middle line:90%
that experienced ETs.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we all get
asked, are they good or bad?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Are they all coming to eat us?

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Are they-- what
are they here for?

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
All of these
questions that we get

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.510 align:middle line:84%
asked all the time
as researchers--

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.780 align:middle line:84%
so can you describe
a little bit,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
your interaction in
the beginning days

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:90%
with the live ETs?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first few
times that I met live ETs,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.668 align:middle line:90%
they were Tall Whites.

00:27:22.668 --> 00:27:23.960 align:middle line:90%
They looked very similar to us.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Their ears, and cartilage
in their nose and ears

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.270 align:middle line:90%
were very different.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.820 align:middle line:84%
It was smaller, a
little bit pointier.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:90%
And their lips were smaller.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.910 align:middle line:90%
They were very tall.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:36.415 align:middle line:84%
They were at least a
foot taller than me.

00:27:36.415 --> 00:27:38.170 align:middle line:90%
And I'm 6 foot 4.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But they're very
ectomorphic, which

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.315 align:middle line:84%
means they were long,
lean-boned people.

00:27:43.315 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>> No fat people.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I never saw--
well, I did see this--

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
it was like a bulbulous
blob type ET one time--

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.715 align:middle line:84%
>> --that could
turn into anything.

00:27:56.715 --> 00:27:57.515 align:middle line:90%
It was really neat.

00:27:57.515 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:90%
>> He could morph.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It could morph.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was very interesting.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:08.530 align:middle line:84%
But so my first experiences
actually looking at one

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.470 align:middle line:84%
at a board table, kind of
thing, and they told us,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.330 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be
three of them in there.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And this is after two years
of me being in the projects.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It took that long for
me to get to that level.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
going to be working--

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be working
with this person-- this person.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:84%
They said person
who's of not of Earth

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:90%
origin, an extraterrestrial.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to be helping you.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
assisting them, actually,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:84%
on an autopsy of one
of their own kind.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's when we
had to start to learn

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:51.330 align:middle line:90%
the language of telepathy.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And that was probably one of
the most amazing experiences

00:28:55.790 --> 00:29:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of my life because there are
no secrets with telepathy.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So they know everything
that's in my crazy head.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And so there's no secrets.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.540 align:middle line:90%
But they're very comical.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And they're very funny.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And when I'm grab--

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.110 align:middle line:84%
it's like, when you're
assisting someone in surgery,

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:28.220 align:middle line:84%
normal surgery, someone would
be like, scalpel, hemostat,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.060 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.660 align:middle line:90%
And with this, it's just--

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:90%
it's so fluid.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.350 align:middle line:90%
You already know what they need.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:90%
It's like you're already--

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:90%
it's already there, the message.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a
voice or anything.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important,
when you do telepathy,

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.910 align:middle line:84%
that you ground yourself
before you go into these CE-5s,

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.970 align:middle line:84%
or if you're going to
meet an extraterrestrial,

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.670 align:middle line:84%
because they pick up
on your vibration.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.250 align:middle line:84%
They pick up on the
frequency of emotion

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because telepathy is
based off emotion.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.700 align:middle line:90%
That's where it spawns from.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you just had a
fight with your loved one,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.565 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
going to go to work,

00:30:10.565 --> 00:30:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to walk up to
the table and say, (GENTLY)

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:90%
hello, how are you today.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Telepathically, it's going
to be like, (AGGRESSIVELY)

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:90%
hello, how are you today?

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So they pick up on the
energy of the emotion

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:30.290 align:middle line:90%
that you have within you.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
So you really have
to center yourself,

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and clear yourself, and
get your head straight

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.410 align:middle line:84%
before you go in there
because you don't want

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.440 align:middle line:90%
to give off the wrong vibe.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.450 align:middle line:84%
They're smart
enough to know this.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's many different
levels of extraterrestrials.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
On the board today, I
just wanted to like--

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.228 align:middle line:84%
every person that talked
on there, I was like--

00:30:54.228 --> 00:30:55.520 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to say something.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:84%
But I got to respect
my colleagues.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
different levels of IQ

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.450 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness of
extraterrestrials.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So you might have an
extraterrestrial group with you

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.720 align:middle line:90%
that's 2000 years more advanced.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.560 align:middle line:10%
You might have one that's
500,000 more advanced.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You might have one that's
1 billion years in advance.

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And they can perform
on themselves,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and turn themselves into
a light body immediately.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Or they can turn themselves into
Paola or Robert [INAUDIBLE],,

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, bam, like that.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:84%
They have this ability to--
because they have mastered

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:42.810 align:middle line:84%
this interdimensional atomic
level that I can't really

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:43.610 align:middle line:90%
explain.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:90%
But Nassim does it way better.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you really say to them,
hello, how are you today?

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Or did you just walk in, and
do your job, and walk out?

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:51.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.020 align:middle line:10%
It was very cordial.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
There was always
communication going on.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And I told everyone,
whoever was at the board,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.260 align:middle line:84%
saw the panel today,
it was very funny.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I remember
one Friday night,

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I was so excited to get out of
there because I had a hot date.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, man.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And I just remember him
saying, oh, have fun tonight.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And I just was like, hmm.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And I just started laughing,
I mean, laughing, laughing,

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:90%
laughing.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he read you
very clearly, didn't he?

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> He knew I wanted
to get out of there.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And he knew everything
I was doing that week,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:90%
and I had plans.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was just a picnic
on my fast bike, but hey.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you told me
another story once,

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.160 align:middle line:90%
which really got to my heart.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And that is you said, you were
in the room working with one.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And you wanted water, like
you're going to get right now.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And you said, that
the being knew

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:90%
you wanted the bottle of water.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And before he even reached
for it, the being reached--

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.373 align:middle line:90%
>> The being gave me the water.

00:32:57.373 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Gave him the water.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:05.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was like, it was so
fast and weird, milliseconds.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
It was like, I didn't
even finish the word water

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:90%
in my brain, like where's some--

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and I went-- and here it is.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even finish it.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I make all my
students, when we

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:21.750 align:middle line:84%
go on close encounters
of the 5th kind

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and contact ETs out in
the middle of nowhere,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I make everyone memorize
about 300 questions.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:35.865 align:middle line:84%
Because when the ETs, if
they do come, within point--

00:33:35.865 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:90%
I think we measured it--

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.130 align:middle line:84%
0.03 seconds, all 300
questions are answered.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
standing there like--

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you're either laughing,
crying, or smiling

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:84%
because you want to ask, now,
one billion more questions.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.360 align:middle line:90%
And you can't.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.467 align:middle line:90%
It's just not-- it's not nice.

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And you don't run up to an
ET and take a picture of him.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.500 align:middle line:84%
You always ask, may I
take a picture of you?

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm the one who took
the light being picture,

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.400 align:middle line:84%
the most famous,
as the Navy said,

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.980 align:middle line:84%
the most famous civilian
picture ever taken

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.449 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial
on Boca Grande Island

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:84%
during a CE-5 with a
Mr. Greer, and myself,

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:90%
and 55 people out there.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.489 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be privy
to that very soon, by the way.

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:31.469 align:middle line:84%
This picture is going to be able
to be accessed by all of you.

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And it came-- the craft
came up on the shore.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.389 align:middle line:84%
And it was about three
feet in front of me.

00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It was about 12
inches in diameter.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.020 align:middle line:84%
The being itself was
maybe eight inches high.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like a
teardrop with a halo around.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
It had a heart chakra and a
line through the center of it.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Has anyone seen
this picture online?

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:54.090 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.315 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going to see it
at our booth at zerocross.co

00:34:57.315 --> 00:35:00.660 align:middle line:84%
here, if you're coming
to the next conference.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So check that out.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And it'll probably also on
zerocross.co on the website

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.190 align:middle line:90%
here pretty soon.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:08.610 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I made--
a couple of artists

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.280 align:middle line:84%
made some renditions
of the actual picture.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show you
the real picture online.

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm, at
the same time, you

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.480 align:middle line:84%
can buy these posters if
you'd like to donate to us,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.610 align:middle line:90%
and check it out.

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:28.705 align:middle line:84%
And because they come
in the form of light--

00:35:28.705 --> 00:35:30.620 align:middle line:90%
we're all light beings.

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.590 align:middle line:84%
We're all at this
vibration, our DNA.

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:90%
We're a crystalline structure.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We're no different than
a radio, to be honest.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's why a lot
of us are affected

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:47.760 align:middle line:84%
by lights, and EMF fields,
and things like this

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.840 align:middle line:90%
because it disrupts our body.

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But have no fear, it makes
us stronger generation

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to generation to
generation, all right?

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Security, what was that?

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.080 align:middle line:90%
A battery change?

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Good?

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, the thing is
that everybody's curious

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.140 align:middle line:84%
because very, very rarely do
you meet people, insiders,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.580 align:middle line:84%
or people that have
had these experiences.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And in the field,
we've categorized

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
all ETs as reptilians,
grays, and Nordics, I mean,

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.590 align:middle line:90%
really simple.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:90%
Shove them in a box.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe for
the general public--

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
question I would ask--

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.607 align:middle line:84%
some of the personalities,
some of the beings?

00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, they were working with you.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You said something really
interesting this morning.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.580 align:middle line:84%
You said some of these
crashes are intentional so we

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.030 align:middle line:90%
learn about the technology.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.752 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that
before in my research.

00:36:41.752 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of these crashes are
intentional because they're

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.040 align:middle line:90%
helping us evolve.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So they give us the--
hopefully, that we

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.150 align:middle line:84%
have conscience to develop the
technology for good, hopefully.

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But can you talk about
their intentions,

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and describe several
of these beings?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:90%
You said 300 different--

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I heard you say, 300
different kinds of beings.

00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the beings are
unlimited on the amount

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.260 align:middle line:90%
of beings.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm aware of about
300 different races.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're a human
race, kind of.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
learned through the projects,

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:84%
when we took DNA, was
that extraterrestrials

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.615 align:middle line:90%
had human DNA in them.

00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:30.880 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.680 align:middle line:90%
Why--

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't that interesting?

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:84%
That would change our whole
entire field, wouldn't it?

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:90%
>> So that told me--

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and I helped develop the
database for the projects

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
to collect many specimen
and different races of DNA

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that, hopefully, they'll release
in the next 24 months, I hope,

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.830 align:middle line:84%
which will answer a lot
of different things.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Because the biggest question
I get is number one, Emery,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.300 align:middle line:90%
are you an ET?

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Or I think I'm an ET because I
just don't fit in around here.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.583 align:middle line:84%
And no one fits in
because you're not--

00:38:10.583 --> 00:38:12.500 align:middle line:84%
you're of this place,
but you're not from here

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:16.220 align:middle line:84%
because everyone has different
percentages, actually,

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:22.920 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial DNA in you,
from all over the galaxies.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.620 align:middle line:84%
So think about
that for a moment.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's proven already.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want
you to know that.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And whether we were made by the
Anunnaki, or made by whatever,

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.135 align:middle line:90%
you are from the stars.

00:38:36.135 --> 00:38:36.935 align:middle line:90%
You are stardust.

00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:40.550 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.925 align:middle line:84%
Getting back to the question,
sorry, I went on a tangent.

00:38:42.925 --> 00:38:44.508 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, but you
also said-- no, no,

00:38:44.508 --> 00:38:47.140 align:middle line:84%
this is something
that we need to hear.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
not just Anunnaki.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the Native
Americans believe that they

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.030 align:middle line:90%
come from the Anunnaki.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, try to broaden
your minds on this subject,

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.470 align:middle line:90%
and study a little bit more.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.333 align:middle line:84%
We can't just do
things in boxes.

00:39:00.333 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Everybody comes
from the Anunnaki.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the Lakota who say

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.170 align:middle line:90%
they come from the Pleiades.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So you had mentioned,
which really interested me,

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:12.700 align:middle line:84%
because also Clifford
Stone had told me this,

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
crashes are intentional so

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:20.650 align:middle line:84%
that we can develop technologies
that may help the planet.

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Whether we use it that way
or not is a different story.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been on multiple
crash sites and have collected

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:90%
materials.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:84%
We wall it off, treat it like
a forensic type, murder type

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.140 align:middle line:90%
situation, like you see on TV.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And I get called in to look
at the craft, number one,

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:44.080 align:middle line:90%
look at the bodies from afar.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
We have satellites
that are like--

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.650 align:middle line:84%
can zoom in right here
and see the carpet fiber

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:51.640 align:middle line:90%
through clouds.

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have so much
amazing technology

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.650 align:middle line:84%
before we get there because
it can be very dangerous.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.170 align:middle line:90%
It could be radiation.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be chemical,
biological things.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We have air scrubbers that suck
the air from around the area

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.530 align:middle line:90%
before we even get in there.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And then we run those samples
through these machines

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to see if there is some
sort of harmful thing

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:84%
that could hurt the team
going in to investigate.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.450 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge thing.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, they're
covering everything up,

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:90%
blocking the roads.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The police and the
fire departments

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:84%
have special codes,
and stuff, that

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.240 align:middle line:84%
are in their protocols
of things like this.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they blame it
on, like, a train spilled over,

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.580 align:middle line:84%
or a truck with
chemicals blew up.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Or they always cover up
with some silly story.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.745 align:middle line:84%
And then everyone,
like in "Close

00:40:47.745 --> 00:40:49.120 align:middle line:84%
in Encounters of
the Third Kind,"

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:90%
they did something like that.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:90%
But that's real.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they do.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:90%
So we go in there.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And there might be a piece of
metal, or a shard of material,

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.530 align:middle line:84%
or a limb, or a
being laying down

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that needs to be resuscitated.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.300 align:middle line:10%
And since the teams
that come out here

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.360 align:middle line:10%
have been in the
projects, and we're

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.740 align:middle line:10%
familiar with the
exobiology of these beings--

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm an exobiologist.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So we know what's safe to
touch, what's not safe to touch.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.420 align:middle line:84%
We also know-- is
that a weapon, or is

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that a device used to do
something else for the craft?

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.600 align:middle line:84%
The most interesting
thing we found out

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.670 align:middle line:84%
is if we take the being,
and it's alive, somewhat,

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and we resuscitate it--

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
or right now, we always
try to keep them alive.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't put them
in the oil drums

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:84%
anymore with formaldehyde,
and ship them to Groom Lake.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:56.570 align:middle line:90%
And then they get there.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.947 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing there
left because it dissolved

00:41:59.947 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:84%
because they don't understand
that a lot of beings

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.250 align:middle line:84%
have to be under a
certain atmosphere.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They breathe different
gases than we do.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.160 align:middle line:84%
So we're learning,
also, how to recreate

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
these atmospheres to keep the
beings alive and to save them.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that in a
second, why they do all this.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.590 align:middle line:90%
And so we go out there.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.618 align:middle line:84%
And we might see a
piece of something,

00:42:27.618 --> 00:42:28.910 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what it is.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So we'll, in a sterile
fashion, collect

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:39.740 align:middle line:84%
this piece of equipment, or
part of the wreckage, of course,

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.640 align:middle line:84%
try to save the passengers
that were on this.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And we noticed a few
of these passengers

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:55.690 align:middle line:84%
were actually not completely
organic, I'll say.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:58.310 align:middle line:84%
They were more like
cybernetic mixed with tissue.

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of them were clones
with nanotechnology in them.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And we found out later
that a lot of the stuff,

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
like these cameras here, and
everything else we have--

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.720 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately,
guys, we're not that

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.910 align:middle line:90%
smart to make a plasma screen.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.533 align:middle line:90%
But it's all reverse engineered.

00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:21.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a little
bit of everything

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that you see, especially
with electronics,

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:27.530 align:middle line:84%
that has been reverse engineered
from extraterrestrial vehicles,

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and extraterrestrial
DNA, and things like this

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.470 align:middle line:90%
that we have collected.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:37.810 align:middle line:84%
We now have a program that's
been going on for 10 years,

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:90%
up in space.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's space salvaging.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're bringing back parts
of craft and other things

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.900 align:middle line:90%
from outer space.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
ongoing thing daily.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And we do have
other space stations

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that are up there that
you don't know about.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That these people that are
working on the salvaging crews

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.580 align:middle line:84%
are collecting stuff, and then
sending it back down here,

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:11.700 align:middle line:84%
so we can analyze it, reproduce
it, and make amazing materials.

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you hear
new materials coming out

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:14.630 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.290 align:middle line:90%
Since I've come forward--

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.702 align:middle line:84%
what was it-- a year and
two months ago, I think,

00:44:20.702 --> 00:44:23.160 align:middle line:84%
a year and two months-- oh, my
gosh, has it been that long?

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.250 align:middle line:90%
The November before last--

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.570 align:middle line:84%
that over 50 different
things that I've spoke about

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:37.920 align:middle line:84%
on Gaia TV have been, now,
in the news, reported,

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:84%
like new materials, new medical
equipment because they're like,

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.050 align:middle line:90%
oh, man, it's already out there.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.030 align:middle line:90%
You already said it.

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Corporations are fighting
over the patents.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:90%
They want to make it.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:48.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's good.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So they're listening.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:55.161 align:middle line:84%
So we're evolving a little bit
faster because of all of you.

00:44:55.161 --> 00:44:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Also is this transnational?

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:58.070 align:middle line:90%
This is global.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.445 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just the United States
that's doing this, right?

00:45:00.445 --> 00:45:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It's transnational that's
interested in this?

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We have-- the
Vatican has their place.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.470 align:middle line:90%
Australia's got their place.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.340 align:middle line:84%
China, and Russia, and
we have our places.

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:90%
And they are corporate driven.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not government.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not the--

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not the governments.

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not United States
Air Force that has a facility

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:90%
that's doing all this.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.890 align:middle line:84%
They're protecting
the facilities

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:84%
at these military bases
or government land.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.060 align:middle line:84%
The government owned land,
especially Indian reservations,

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of
underground facilities

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.237 align:middle line:84%
because they want to not
have a lot of traffic

00:45:36.237 --> 00:45:37.070 align:middle line:90%
going through there.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why Indian reservations
have their own police

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:84%
departments, and
things like this.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.900 align:middle line:90%


00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's another good
point to point out,

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:50.360 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of these facilities
are on national park lands,

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and BLM lands, and
Indian reservations,

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.100 align:middle line:90%
and military bases.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said that it's
an industrial program.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it's an
industrial military complex.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's not military as--

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.640 align:middle line:90%
it's militarized.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's a private militarized
is what I'm saying.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, going back to what
you were going to talk about

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:11.870 align:middle line:90%
because I'm going to remind you.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You said that the beings were
resuscitated for a reason,

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and that you were going
to tell us later on.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.860 align:middle line:84%
What was the reason
to resuscitate

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.985 align:middle line:90%
all these different beings?

00:46:22.985 --> 00:46:26.934 align:middle line:90%


00:46:26.934 --> 00:46:28.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what do they want to do?

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What's--

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're talking
about a highly evolved human.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about you
guys 100,000 years from now.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:45.680 align:middle line:84%
We can learn a lot
about someone like us

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.960 align:middle line:84%
that's 100,000 years
more advanced and older.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We can look at your
DNA, fill in the gaps,

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.000 align:middle line:84%
make sure we never
get sick, develop

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.980 align:middle line:84%
special synthetic proteins,
and genome sequencing,

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.420 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Big pharma has a huge
control over all of this.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So many things are
cured by these,

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:90%
by collecting specimens--

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Of ETs.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> --of extraterrestrials, and
also craft, and other devices.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Could they regenerate limbs?

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.510 align:middle line:90%
Do they regenerate anything?

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:47:29.928 --> 00:47:31.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been able
to do that forever.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.890 align:middle line:90%
We have 3D printers.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.930 align:middle line:90%
We can print bodies now.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing--
it's funny because I

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:84%
started talking about 3D
printing a year ago for organs.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And they just came out,
like a month ago, and said,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.190 align:middle line:90%
we just 3D printed an ear.

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:49.720 align:middle line:90%


00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's like,
yeah, that's cool.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:52.120 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.037 align:middle line:84%
They don't say-- the
news doesn't tell you how

00:47:54.037 --> 00:47:56.230 align:middle line:90%
they do it, which I don't like.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.060 align:middle line:84%
They're using
cellulose, and collagen.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And I could go into the
scientific parts of it.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Or we're using growth
factors and stem cells

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to do this with your own tissue.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.970 align:middle line:84%
So I just need a little
bit of your tissue,

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and then have a scaffolding
of cellulose, and collagen,

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and then make your own ear.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
But the coolest thing is we
can make your own organs.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, China's over there making
clones and growing people

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
to kill them because
33 people a day

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.980 align:middle line:90%
die over there waiting to be--

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:34.480 align:middle line:84%
waiting for an organ
transplant, which for me,

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I can't really agree with
that because it's a person.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And what was amazing,
when you start

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:45.700 align:middle line:84%
getting into your medical
self because you have

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.910 align:middle line:84%
all this knowledge, is you
were saying that we have,

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:53.740 align:middle line:84%
today, the ability to not
only regenerate ourselves,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.760 align:middle line:90%
our tissue, our teeth.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Or you don't have to
have a prosthetic arm.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.980 align:middle line:84%
You could regenerate
these things.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.960 align:middle line:84%
But you also say
we have the cures

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.070 align:middle line:90%
for a lot of the diseases.

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, I met
the guy who invented HIV.

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I met the guy who cured HIV.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:17.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of viruses that
come out new all the time.

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:18.475 align:middle line:90%
It's just for testing.

00:49:18.475 --> 00:49:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:26.602 align:middle line:84%
It's for sale to countries
and terrorist groups.

00:49:26.602 --> 00:49:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you have ever
walked through a bus

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:41.190 align:middle line:84%
station, or an airport, or a
major city, or pass by a camera

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:44.670 align:middle line:84%
under a red light,
they pretty much

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:51.940 align:middle line:84%
have your DNA signature, which
is pretty much all of you.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And that DNA signature,
every one of you

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.780 align:middle line:90%
give off a different frequency.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And this frequency
is in a database.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And this is a control thing.

00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:08.120 align:middle line:90%
And it also has to do with race.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:90%
It's political too.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually
send down a frequency

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:18.120 align:middle line:84%
to this exact individual,
or beam the whole thing

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.390 align:middle line:84%
through seven satellites over
the whole planet, just this one

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.910 align:middle line:84%
frequency, to know
exactly that you're

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:27.360 align:middle line:84%
sitting in this
chair in front of me,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.042 align:middle line:90%
and then stop your heart.

00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is beyond
scale, our infometry.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Read Tom Bearden's
book "Oblivion."

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And you also mentioned they
could exterminate whole groups

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.050 align:middle line:84%
of people because of
the signature of DNA.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So they can actually
terminate an entire race

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.200 align:middle line:84%
due to its lineage, if
they really wanted to,

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.390 align:middle line:90%
which is very scary.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:51:00.100 align:middle line:84%
So if they wanted a certain
race completely genocide,

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.510 align:middle line:84%
they can actually
do that right now.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is a scary-- this is a
very scary and negative part,

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:06.385 align:middle line:84%
which I don't like
talking about.

00:51:06.385 --> 00:51:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>> No, well, it's
not necessary--

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.170 align:middle line:84%
because every technology has
a positive and negative use,

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:12.310 align:middle line:90%
every technology.

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that in your
heart, your conversation

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is 90% that you want to go
back into the biomedical

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.190 align:middle line:90%
because you want to save--

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.600 align:middle line:90%
you want to save people.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And you love-- you have a
passion for the medical.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know you
can help people.

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And you want to develop
these positive technologies

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.180 align:middle line:90%
to help people.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.805 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've talked
to me about that,

00:51:32.805 --> 00:51:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that that's your real intention.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, honestly,
guys, no offense.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.590 align:middle line:90%
This is just a hobby for me.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm just telling
you my life story.

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it's just
something I wake up with,

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.310 align:middle line:84%
like you guys do,
and go to work.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
had happened to me.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But it led me to these
inventions and these patents

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:56.755 align:middle line:84%
that I can cure you with your
own cells from your own body.

00:51:56.755 --> 00:52:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I can concentrate the healing
properties of your body,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and put it into an area of your
body that needs it the most,

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.550 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your
brain or your knee.

00:52:06.550 --> 00:52:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I decreased total knee
replacement and total hip

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.155 align:middle line:84%
replacement by 55% in the
United States of America.

00:52:14.155 --> 00:52:19.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.070 align:middle line:84%
--just by concentrating
the growth factors

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:27.750 align:middle line:84%
and platelets in your blood
and injecting it into the knee.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Orthopedic surgeons hated
me for the first five years

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:39.150 align:middle line:84%
because they make about
$1,200 from insurance

00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:40.670 align:middle line:90%
for a total knee.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And that patient's
out a couple days.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:45.960 align:middle line:90%
And the PAs have to be there.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's so much cost
for the hospital.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.330 align:middle line:90%
And I said, until--

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, you know what?

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.990 align:middle line:84%
You can charge a patient
$2,500 and use autologous

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:59.100 align:middle line:90%
platelet rich plasma.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Autologous means it comes
from your own body, and not

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:05.010 align:middle line:90%
someone else's blood.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And inject this
into this patient,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and regenerate the entire
knee before doing surgery,

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:84%
or at least to prolong them
having surgery another 10

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.020 align:middle line:90%
or 20 years, and guess what?

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.010 align:middle line:90%
You can charge cash.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:26.617 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now, they want to talk.

00:53:26.617 --> 00:53:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, I can
make-- they said--

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.848 align:middle line:84%
because when I came
out with my device,

00:53:29.848 --> 00:53:31.140 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't covered by insurance.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.030 align:middle line:90%
It's FDA 510(k) approved.

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.860 align:middle line:84%
But the insurance
doesn't want that.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.378 align:middle line:90%
Big pharma doesn't want that.

00:53:38.378 --> 00:53:40.670 align:middle line:84%
They want you taking the
pills, and putting the creams,

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and doing the steroid
injections, which, by the way,

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:45.060 align:middle line:90%
break down tenocytes.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So the whole steroid
injections thing,

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I don't even understand this
because we've already proven

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.560 align:middle line:90%
it breaks down tenocytes.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.310 align:middle line:90%
So it actually makes it worse.

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying that
a 90-year-old, someone

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.490 align:middle line:84%
over 90 years of age who
has a hard time grabbing

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:06.900 align:middle line:84%
the cornflakes out of the
cabinet, is in a lot of pain,

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.660 align:middle line:84%
then yeah, go ahead,
and get the pain gone.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.685 align:middle line:84%
But they're not treating
the actual issue.

00:54:14.685 --> 00:54:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the pain
away for three months.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.727 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to come back.

00:54:17.727 --> 00:54:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
be 10 times worse.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, you need a
shoulder scope by the way.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's this horrible circle
in the medical field of,

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.645 align:middle line:90%
we're going to treat you now.

00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:31.770 align:middle line:84%
But you're still going to
have to come back and get

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:35.420 align:middle line:84%
another treatment, then
probably surgery, and then maybe

00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.310 align:middle line:84%
another surgery later
on 10 years later.

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a very vicious
circle with the American

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:46.820 align:middle line:90%
Medical Association.

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
fighting them forever.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
we're changing.

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And the newer children coming
out of the universities

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:59.090 align:middle line:84%
are, well, they're
very conscious.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:00.590 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, you know what?

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I just went through all
this medical school.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I still can't, especially
in sports medicine,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing here to
actually cure the patient.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.620 align:middle line:90%
This is just to get by.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So by inventing
these things, you

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:21.300 align:middle line:84%
have everything you need in
your body to heal yourself, OK?

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not under some
rock in the Amazon, OK?

00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:26.785 align:middle line:84%
It's not some little
fungi, or something.

00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And big pharma hates
when I say this.

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You have everything you need
in your body to heal itself.

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, we're just
not at the right voltage

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:39.340 align:middle line:90%
for our cells to work properly.

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's another thing
because we're constantly

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:49.620 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded by the lights,
by all the 4G, 5G, everything.

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:51.660 align:middle line:84%
But like I said before,
it is strengthening

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:54.520 align:middle line:90%
us and our lineage.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So our children's children
will be super strong.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
ETs look down at us.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And I look up at them
like they're superheroes.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:03.180 align:middle line:90%
But we're the superheroes.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.883 align:middle line:84%
They think we're
the superheroes.

00:56:04.883 --> 00:56:06.300 align:middle line:84%
They're like, look
at all the crap

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.160 align:middle line:90%
these guys have been through.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.580 align:middle line:84%
We have been stunted for
100 years of technology

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.740 align:middle line:90%
since Tesla.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.145 align:middle line:90%
And we're still here.

00:56:15.145 --> 00:56:16.687 align:middle line:84%
We're still using
gas, coal, and oil.

00:56:16.687 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> We're still plugging away.

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.475 align:middle line:90%
We're still plugging away.

00:56:21.475 --> 00:56:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to lead
you into another area

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.950 align:middle line:84%
right now because you
have so much to share.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and you watch
the Gaia episodes.

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.610 align:middle line:84%
People are always asking me
about portals, or portals,

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.850 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, and how you can--

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:40.760 align:middle line:84%
you talked about the natural
ones and the created ones

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:43.650 align:middle line:84%
because you said to go
to this other level,

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:49.260 align:middle line:84%
this other dimension,
you had to go

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:54.570 align:middle line:84%
through this almost
mysterious atmosphere

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.190 align:middle line:90%
to collect specimens.

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't always
tissue specimens.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Some of it was flora and fauna.

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:06.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, your story of taking
some kind of plant that

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:10.380 align:middle line:84%
can adhere to your
body, like a Band-Aid,

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:12.960 align:middle line:84%
was-- can you tell that story--
going through the portal,

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:16.005 align:middle line:84%
and getting that kind of
specimen, and what it does?

00:57:16.005 --> 00:57:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Has that aired
already, that episode?

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.880 align:middle line:90%
Olivia?

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.440 align:middle line:84%
About the plant
that eats people?

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:28.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No it hasn't.

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That hasn't?

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:30.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk about that yet.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, then can--

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How many of you
watch Gaia, me on Gaia?

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.415 align:middle line:90%
Raise the hands.

00:57:34.415 --> 00:57:35.215 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:35.215 --> 00:57:36.015 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:57:36.015 --> 00:57:37.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk about
any portal experience?

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't
talk about that.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Can't talk about the plant.

00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> But I'll talk--

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.860 align:middle line:90%
I will talk about the portals.

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:45.392 align:middle line:84%
So there are areas
on the planet that

00:57:45.392 --> 00:57:47.600 align:middle line:84%
have natural portals that
have been here for millions

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.380 align:middle line:90%
and millions of years.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with the
Earth, and the ley lines,

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and different
axises of the Earth,

00:57:55.220 --> 00:58:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and also the astrological
alignment for these things

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to open and close
at certain times.

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of bases are
built on these areas,

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:13.580 align:middle line:84%
where they will build a man-made
portal technology on top of--

00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:18.650 align:middle line:84%
above the area where
this other real portal

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:20.450 align:middle line:84%
exists because
they're harvesting

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:23.380 align:middle line:90%
the energy from that.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And this has been going
on, by the way for--

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.205 align:middle line:84%
when I was there in
'93, they already

00:58:31.205 --> 00:58:34.850 align:middle line:84%
had two decades
of videos of teams

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:84%
going through these
portals to unknown places

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.840 align:middle line:90%
and collecting specimens.

00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And I'm--

00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Could some of them be
planets, unknown planets?

00:58:42.723 --> 00:58:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can't truthfully
say because we were debriefed

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.770 align:middle line:90%
to an extent.

00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
allowed to ask that.

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:56.430 align:middle line:90%
And I did not--

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I was not allowed to
ask that, number one.

00:58:58.610 --> 00:58:59.450 align:middle line:90%
And I do really--

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I do not know.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the only ones I did
know were inter-Earth ones.

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:05.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Inter-Earth.

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That was real.

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.970 align:middle line:90%
That was definitely real.

00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So the inter-planet--
I'll say, the other

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:18.470 align:middle line:84%
places that we went with these
teams of usually seven people,

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and you walk through this veil.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:24.555 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a little blurry,
kind of like Saran wrap.

00:59:24.555 --> 00:59:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you see in the
movies, like all this light.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, you're
instantaneously somewhere else.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's the most-- some of
the most beautiful things

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:35.690 align:middle line:90%
I have ever seen.

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And it can be very
dangerous as well.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:42.965 align:middle line:84%
And we also have-- we can
take metal with us and drones.

00:59:42.965 --> 00:59:44.840 align:middle line:84%
So we have a lot of
drones that come with us,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and robots, and cyborgs, and
all sorts of weird things

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.770 align:middle line:84%
that are on wheels that help
carry a lot of this stuff.

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We also take canine units
that are specially equipped

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.870 align:middle line:90%
in suits.

00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And depending on the
atmosphere that we

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:05.000 align:middle line:84%
go to decides if we are going to
be completely fully suited up,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.940 align:middle line:84%
or the atmosphere is safe to
breathe, and things like this.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes about two months
to get trained to go

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to a specific place that
has already been visited.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So I never went to a place
that was not already visited,

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that was not already recorded.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So we got to see many missions
and many hours of video footage

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:35.360 align:middle line:84%
before going to this
place from past missions.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
So we know what
this plant is OK.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that don't
touch that rock.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:44.540 align:middle line:84%
We know that liquid,
stay away from.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.670 align:middle line:84%
We know if you hear
this, that, or the other.

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So the dogs are
brought in because they

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
can smell, number one, a
lot better than we can,

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:58.010 align:middle line:84%
special gases, and
things like this.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And they can also
hear frequencies

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and predict earthquakes
and storms that are coming,

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.850 align:middle line:90%
that might just come.

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It might be the most beautiful
day out when you get there.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And five seconds later,
you're in a hurricane.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very--

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:18.920 align:middle line:84%
we have all this equipment
and these cool little robotic

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
devices that have
these big wheels.

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And they come in,
kind of like a Rover

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.547 align:middle line:84%
you see, but way more advanced
than the stuff you see on Mars.

01:01:28.547 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
That's like a joke for me.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:30.797 align:middle line:90%
That's like a cartoon thing.

01:01:30.797 --> 01:01:33.200 align:middle line:90%


01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we put these
poles in the ground.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the poles on the
computer scans the entire area.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like a radar.

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And in our helmets,
we can see each other.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And we know where
everyone's at, at all times,

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:54.740 align:middle line:84%
in case someone falls
into a situation.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.135 align:middle line:84%
Because there's been
some times, like when

01:01:58.135 --> 01:02:00.230 align:middle line:84%
you go to the dry
salt flats, you

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.360 align:middle line:90%
know how that's really cracked?

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.748 align:middle line:84%
Those little cracks
are all over the place.

01:02:04.748 --> 01:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You guys know what
I'm talking about?

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.152 align:middle line:90%
Wake up.

01:02:07.152 --> 01:02:07.952 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:02:07.952 --> 01:02:10.644 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%


01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And you might think
that's solid ground.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.390 align:middle line:90%


01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And we've lost people.

01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be walking and boom.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They just fell 1800
feet through this thing.

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And they're gone.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So this scanner scans
backscattered, low biometric

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.800 align:middle line:90%
waves down into the ground.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we know
where we can walk.

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We have a whole
three-dimensional map

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.650 align:middle line:90%
of the whole place.

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And we learn this
before we go there.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But on past missions, they
found out the hard way,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.280 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So you've lost a man in them.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Many people.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I was just contacted
recently by this corporation

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:12.290 align:middle line:90%
to come back and do a mission.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we
had a incident.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.510 align:middle line:90%


01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And these are my friends
that I've known for 20 years.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:28.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, what happened?

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
And they all perished
in this mission.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So because of my
position here right now,

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I have a mission
to clean the earth,

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and to help you guys
out, and help the world.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was my best
interest to keep doing this.

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:44.790 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:50.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And actually, we don't
have very much time left.

01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But he just read my mind because
we have less than about--

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.540 align:middle line:90%
we have five minutes, Emery.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have had
long conversations.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And what would you
like the world to know?

01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
What would you like
the people to know?

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.950 align:middle line:10%
Because this is being
broadcast all over the world.

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Because he's got a big heart.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.333 align:middle line:90%
He really has a big heart.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:11.500 align:middle line:90%
You can get that from Emery.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.900 align:middle line:90%
People have said that to me.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.210 align:middle line:84%
What is it in the
last five minutes

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:19.010 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like to communicate?

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everyone needs
to know, there's hope.

01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're really on
a great trajectory.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
go be the black wolf,

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and go with doom and
gloom, well, go ahead.

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:35.300 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to serve us.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.850 align:middle line:90%
How does that serve?

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.982 align:middle line:90%
So let's be the white wolf.

01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And let's move forward.

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to the stars, and
meet our brothers and sisters.

01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's clean this planet up.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Let's clean these oceans up.

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.977 align:middle line:90%
Let's clean the animals up.

01:04:50.977 --> 01:04:53.959 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:53.959 --> 01:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%


01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Without the oceans that
give us all the oxygen--

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
that we're destroying at
a incredible rate, OK?

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Yes, ETs exist, yes, UFOs,
and ETVs, and all that.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be shown to us.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.880 align:middle line:84%
They can't--
Antarctica is melting.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
already shooting up.

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
They can't cover it
up that much longer.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:25.130 align:middle line:90%
So get over that.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:29.430 align:middle line:90%
But let's take care of our home.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't
take care of our home,

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.270 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be casted off.

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.815 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth is not going
to put up with us anymore.

01:05:37.815 --> 01:05:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee it.

01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And let's get up there.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Who wants to go with me?

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:46.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHING]

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:49.505 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:49.505 --> 01:05:51.990 align:middle line:90%


01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.713 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
do this together.

01:05:53.713 --> 01:05:56.551 align:middle line:90%


01:05:56.551 --> 01:06:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I am definitely
going to do this.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to get there.

01:06:02.890 --> 01:06:05.340 align:middle line:90%
But we got to do it together.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you so much.

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.420 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.300 align:middle line:90%


01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you guys.

01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:15.418 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for coming.

01:06:15.418 --> 01:06:19.720 align:middle line:90%
