00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome, everyone, to
Post-Conference Monday

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.080 align:middle line:90%
at Conscious Life Expo.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.320 align:middle line:84%
We're so excited to have
Emery with us this year.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.540 align:middle line:84%
He has had an amazing
life, and, really

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle line:84%
wants to share what he has
experienced to help us and help

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:90%
the whole planet.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:84%
He really is centered
on helping everyone.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:84%
He is a US Air Force
veteran with a long history

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.620 align:middle line:84%
of assignments in
highly classified

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:90%
deep black covert operations.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
He acquired extensive knowledge
in biologics and genetics

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:84%
while working in the
underground bases and labs,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
including Sandia and Los
Alamos National Facilities.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Today, he's going to be
interviewed by Olivia Sky,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about the ET
hybrids, the cloning programs,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
and how we would
recognize these beings,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and as much as he can about
the extraterrestrial genetic

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:90%
programs.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's give a warm welcome to
Olivia Sky and Emery Smith.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, everyone.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:01:13.154 --> 00:01:14.446 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you want to say anything?

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:16.311 align:middle line:90%
Do you say hi?

00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:17.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've known Emery
for almost 10 years.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:90%
And it started, actually--

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
my father had a self-sustainable
farm in Florida,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and at that time,
it wasn't popular,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
I guess, or I didn't know much
about organic food and all

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.850 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
But he had a lot of people
like cancer patients and things

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
like that we're looking to
eat nutrient dense food.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.528 align:middle line:84%
And we had a customer, to
make this story kind of short,

00:01:43.528 --> 00:01:44.570 align:middle line:90%
come to the farm one day.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And she was like,
John, do you believe

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.000 align:middle line:90%
in extraterrestrials and UFOs?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, something
kind of came over me.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And I was really young, and
I had just this obsession

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.493 align:middle line:84%
with space and if we were
alone, and everything

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
you kind of start to
wonder that kind of maybe

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.890 align:middle line:84%
you guys experienced when
you had your awakening.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this woman
came, and she asked

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
if he believed in ETs and
UFOs and he's like well, yeah,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
like we can't be the
only ones out here.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And my daughter is really
interested in this stuff.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I sat next
to this guy on a plane

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and he showed me all these
photos of ETs and crafts,

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and I really think you
should talk to him.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.877 align:middle line:84%
And so then the
next weekend, my dad

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:28.460 align:middle line:84%
called him and we
went to go meet him.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
And that was Emery.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:90%
So I've known him since then.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And I did a three year
internship with him

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.080 align:middle line:84%
a few years ago in New
Mexico on a project that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
had to do with ground
penetrating radar.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I've kind of
gotten to interview him

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
over the last 10 years and
ask him all these questions.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:90%
And each year, it got crazier.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.308 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know--

00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know what
you did in the projects

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
probably until after like the
fifth year of knowing you,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and I just--

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It was classified.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I would call him
with every question.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And so today, I manage
all of his social media

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and his websites.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.945 align:middle line:90%
And so I thought--

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
he asked if I
could interview him

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
to help probe some
questions, and so here I am.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.955 align:middle line:90%
So welcome, Emery.

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, Olivia.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:90%
Olivia cuts herself.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
She's very humble,
and she's been

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.260 align:middle line:84%
on some very dangerous
missions involving combat.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
She's saved my life a few
times during full firefights

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and things like this, retrieving
different particles of craft

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
and beings and on amazing
treasure hunts for some

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of the most amazing historical
things that will someday

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:90%
be brought out to us.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And so she's she's a quite
the the adventurist, I'll say,

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
and also very hardcore.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Even though you're looking like
some little supermodel here.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.677 align:middle line:90%
>> It was really--

00:04:02.677 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
you're probably the hardest
person I've ever worked for.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a real asshole.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You--

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> For good reasons
when I do internships,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:90%
because it's about safety.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're jumping
out of helicopters

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
and one wrong move can
kill the whole team

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.279 align:middle line:84%
when we're repelling
down 1,000 foot

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.370 align:middle line:84%
down underground into
these caves and caverns,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're down there
for days at a time.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's many
things in survival--

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, I used to teach
Air Force survival school--

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.442 align:middle line:90%
that you have to be aware of.

00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's not many
interns that make it

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:90%
past three months with me.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So for her to make it three
years was quite impressive.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
I tried to push
her to the limits,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.660 align:middle line:84%
but she kept coming
back for more.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I was--

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you guys--

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
do you guys watch
Cosmic Disclosure?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:90%
All of you?

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, most of you?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> How many of you?

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.108 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so a lot of you.

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:90%
So on one of those episodes, I--

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.720 align:middle line:84%
he spoke a little bit about
a project we worked on.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.303 align:middle line:84%
It was in New Mexico, but it had
to do with ground penetrating

00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
radar and a lot of
things that we were

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.782 align:middle line:90%
scanning underneath the earth.

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a
treasure project,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.615 align:middle line:84%
and that was-- this is kind
of what he was talking about.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It was really intense
and really hard.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
It was really long
hours, but it was

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
profound experiences,

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.248 align:middle line:84%
because it felt so concrete
to both of us that like--

00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is a
craft under there,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.100 align:middle line:90%
if you can't make that up.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:84%
There is something more to
this planet and all of us.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.110 align:middle line:84%
>> We were actually contracted
out by this corporation

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:middle line:84%
as remote viewers first, to
scan a section of New Mexico two

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:90%
hours south of Albuquerque.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a 95% effective
remote viewer,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:84%
but with Olivia,
I'm 115% effective

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.230 align:middle line:84%
if we have both double
hit, so it makes me

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.300 align:middle line:90%
more money if I bring her.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:84%
So we would go through these
quarantined off, graphed

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
out acres, and we
have flags and we just

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
walk through this side of
the mountain or this field.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And every time we get a
hit, we throw a flag down.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So it saves them a lot of
money and a lot of time,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.910 align:middle line:84%
because they're using this slow
wave radar, ground penetrating

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
radar that goes all the
way through the earth.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And the volumetric
wave pattern that

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.410 align:middle line:84%
reflects it that comes back is
400 times greater resolution

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:90%
than that CAT scan.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%
How it works was they would--

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.507 align:middle line:84%
how-- he kept it so
compartmentalized.

00:06:41.507 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
The scientists never
got to explain too much

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of how it worked,
but one night he did.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he hacks into
six satellites and he gets a--

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.275 align:middle line:84%
that's just to locate the
GPS coordinate and then--

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> A stereotactic what we
call XYZ of the Inner Earth

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
of coordinates of the
inside of the earth.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.437 align:middle line:84%
So we know exactly where
it's at within a millimeter.

00:07:05.437 --> 00:07:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were there to
remote view, and we would--

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.395 align:middle line:84%
because it was really
expensive to run the satellite.

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So you had to be pretty
specific with where you wanted

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.340 align:middle line:90%
to drag it across the ground.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we would go and
we would seek out areas

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that we call hits, we
would get a hit on.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And the scientists would shoot
this area, and what it would do

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is it would shoot
a low frequency

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:90%
wave through the Earth.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And it had every Earth
known element indexed

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:90%
into the computer system.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.235 align:middle line:84%
So it would-- when the
images would reflect back.

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So it would shoot
this wave down.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.612 align:middle line:84%
And then when it hit
whatever the target was,

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
it would reflect
back, and it would

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:84%
produce this volumetric
image on the computer of--

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.435 align:middle line:84%
it is like in perfect
detail of everything

00:07:45.435 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:90%
that was below there.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And it looks kind of weird at
first, because it was in that--

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:52.580 align:middle line:84%
what's that spectrum
that's all the neon colors?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And you couldn't really
tell, but until he--

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
it looked flat at
first, and then he

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
would put it into a 3D format
and it would become 3D.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.670 align:middle line:84%
But what was cool was
it had all the Earth

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:90%
known elements indexed.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:84%
It would tell you exactly
what it was made out of.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So when things would
come back in the shapes

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of double tetrahedron
pyramids and said unknown,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.170 align:middle line:84%
we were like, wow,
that's something.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We knew right away
that these are craft.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:22.940 align:middle line:84%
There was beings down there
in 35 foot capsules in stasis.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor who
invented this system

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.320 align:middle line:84%
was the guy who discovered
all the tunnels from Mexico

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.397 align:middle line:90%
for the DOD.

00:08:31.397 --> 00:08:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The drug tunnels.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.289 align:middle line:90%
>> The drug tunnels.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:84%
And so he was also
severely threatened

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
because there was
a leak in the CIA.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So he took a liking to
Olivia and over eight or nine

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
months taught her how to
use this type of technology.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.023 align:middle line:90%
And we have lots of--

00:08:51.023 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> We had a lot of pictures.

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Cool pictures and videos
that we're going to be showing

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:90%
online soon of that story.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
But the neat thing is
we're sitting there

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:90%
and he's a scientist.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't believe
in remote viewing.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.168 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why did you have
these remote viewers come

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:90%
on the compound?

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And he was very--

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Remote viewing.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
So we went out there
we tagged everything.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Then they ran over--

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.020 align:middle line:90%
ran it over with the radar.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And every flag we
hit 100% accurate.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.642 align:middle line:84%
>> The weirdest
thing he said was,

00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:22.100 align:middle line:84%
"I don't believe
what you're doing,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:84%
but I have to, because
somehow you're right."

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And he just-- and he
had experiences too.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It was a really
interesting product,

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
because everyone that worked
on it had some kind of--

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
it was called the God Project,
because the people that

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
ran it were very
Christian, and they really

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
believed that they were going
to find the treasure of God.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And there was things there that
almost like in religious times

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.510 align:middle line:84%
like in the Bible, people
think they're angels,

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
but maybe they're
extraterrestrials.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%
And so it was kind of like that.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And it really shook
their paradigm

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
to be working on this project,
because they would see things

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
in the sky, and these
images would come back

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
from underneath where
they thought were the lost

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.347 align:middle line:84%
tablets or the lost
Ark of the Covenant

00:10:02.347 --> 00:10:03.680 align:middle line:90%
is what they believed was there.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually-- it
was a treasure hunter that

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.610 align:middle line:84%
started this project,
and he was looking

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:90%
for the grand Spanish treasure.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the largest
treasure yet to be found.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.260 align:middle line:90%
But there's a lot there.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.640 align:middle line:90%
So it's an interesting place.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.323 align:middle line:90%
We always questioned whether--

00:10:18.323 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was proven
to be a portal there,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
but we questioned whether
all these people were drawn

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:90%
from all parts of the world.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
Mayan stuff there.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.510 align:middle line:84%
There was Templar stuff
there that would come back

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:90%
through these images.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was just strange that
from all over the world,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.340 align:middle line:84%
they were brought to this one
spot, and it was in New Mexico.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.185 align:middle line:84%
So with him, he was
a hardcore scientist,

00:10:41.185 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't believe in
any of this kind of stuff.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:90%
But yet it was in his face.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And we said, why don't you show
this to the project manager?

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's like, "That's
not what I was hired for.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.690 align:middle line:84%
I was hired to find gold,
not to find crafts."

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So he just would throw the
images away and didn't care.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>> He was like, "I'm not here
to find anything else but what I

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:00.260 align:middle line:84%
was paid for," and it
was to find the gold.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.648 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, but what about
this gigantic pyramid here

00:11:04.648 --> 00:11:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and this, this, and this?

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
He's like, well, I don't know.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle line:84%
The computer just won't
tell me what it is.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It said it was like--

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
the weirdest thing
the computer said--

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.113 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said because
it's not from here.

00:11:16.113 --> 00:11:18.405 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that it was radioactive
and also not radioactive

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, because
the computer didn't know how

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:90%
to read it.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
the scientist said

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.720 align:middle line:84%
was, I don't know
how to explain this,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want
to talk about it.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of the
last intense projects

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.570 align:middle line:90%
we worked on together.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
why I'm here today

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is because I've gotten to
go through a lot with Emery

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.350 align:middle line:84%
and understand and
we're very proud

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
that he's come
forward and gotten

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to share all this with
everybody, because we really

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
hope it'll make a difference,
that this knowledge

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and this information
somehow will affect someone

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
just by listening to it or
people will listen to it that

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
have this technology and feel
like it's time to come forward

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
with it, because there's so much
more that we could be doing.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And there's such a
better life for everyone

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.660 align:middle line:84%
here, whether you're
sick or you just, you

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:90%
hate sitting in traffic.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all just--
we could be so far

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.050 align:middle line:84%
past that if this information
and this technology

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
would come out.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for coming
forward to share with everyone

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:90%
what you've experienced.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's get into some fun things.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
So we had a few questions.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But the first question
I wanted to ask

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.170 align:middle line:84%
you was when you got out,
who was the first person you

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:34.900 align:middle line:90%
told your secret to and why?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a good one.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:90%
You never asked me that before.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone knows I was
Vice President for CSETI

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:90%
with Greer for seven years.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And when I got out, I still
didn't talk to anybody.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I was still doing
minor contract work

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
flying back to Albuquerque,
New Mexico every couple months

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and doing some side
work, moonlighting stuff,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.050 align:middle line:90%
kind of the same thing.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
But I moved back to Florida
because my family was sick,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
and I had to take care of them
once I got out of the military.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.823 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.823 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I kept everything
pretty much to myself,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
and it was kind of hard leaving
that type of work environment

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
to go into working in
a hospital harvesting

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
saphenous vein during coronary
artery bypass graft surgeries

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and assisting surgeons
in regular surgeries

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and going back to the old school
stuff, just to be in the matrix

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.420 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I was looking
out and noticed

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.200 align:middle line:84%
there was a group called CSETI
a group of civilians that were

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:90%
contacting extraterrestrials.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't go in there to
disrupt anything or anything.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.830 align:middle line:84%
I went there just to
investigate and for my own self

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.482 align:middle line:90%
and see what everyone was doing.

00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.690 align:middle line:90%
And they had a good protocol.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.482 align:middle line:84%
It was very similar to
protocols that we're

00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:90%
used to in the military.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And they had the right way,
because it's conscious,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.620 align:middle line:90%
it was safe, it was--

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Greer had a really good
setup going on as far

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:84%
as the protocols were that
he came up with, by the way.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
And it was a great time.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It was a good time.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And that led me to
become the person who

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
did the autopsy in "Sirius,"
the documentary on the Atacama

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.240 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:84%
That was me doing
it, not Dr. Greer.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he ask you because-- did
he know at any point you had

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.210 align:middle line:84%
done 3,000 similar procedures
just in a secret lab?

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wouldn't
let anyone know,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.543 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't want
to be treated special.

00:14:33.543 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to be one of--

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%
a normal person.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.645 align:middle line:84%
And so I didn't say
anything, but they

00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:43.770 align:middle line:84%
knew about my medical
background because I invented

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
the first tabletop
stem cell concentrator

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and played the rich
plasma concentrator.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:90%
So they knew about my patents.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.247 align:middle line:84%
They knew about my job,
all my 21 corporations

00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:90%
that were very successful.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:84%
I lost everything, but at
that time was very successful.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.037 align:middle line:84%
So they knew about my
medical background.

00:15:00.037 --> 00:15:01.620 align:middle line:84%
They did not know
about anything else.

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't share that
with them, because I

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know what they knew
and how deep they were actually

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
into the project.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And they did have some amazing
contacts with some corporations

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
that were classified that I was
privy to going with the team

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.990 align:middle line:84%
to investigate certain
devices and certain things.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
But there came a time where
I had to disembark from that

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and help my family and also
start my own zero-point energy

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
lab down in Florida,
which I did.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So the money I was making off
selling my platelet rich plasma

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
kits and stem cell
kits to the hospitals

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
was funding my zero-point
energy lab, which we

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:90%
became super successful with.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:84%
The government knew
I was doing it.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
They approached me many
times and just said, Smith,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.570 align:middle line:90%
we know what you're doing.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Just do not teach
anyone how to do that

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and do not hook it up to
the grid, which of course, I

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.870 align:middle line:90%
would never do, right?

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So once we really proved
it and got it working,

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
I had to get it
validated by not my lab.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:19.650 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying, well, I
made this, and I validate it.

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:90%
It's perfect.

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can't do that
in the medical field

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
or in these fields,
because you have

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
to get private corporations
and scientists to validate

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.530 align:middle line:90%
what you're saying is true.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
So I had to move to Topanga,
California for about a year

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
because there was
a facility there

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
that had the proper equipment
and the proper scientists

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:90%
to validate the system.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.690 align:middle line:90%
So I made an exchange for them.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I built them something,
and it was a trade off

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
if they would take
a look at my system

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
and see what they
could come up with.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
I got a phone call,

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:90%
and they were like, it works.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:90%
Come get it now.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:13.422 align:middle line:84%
So jumped in the Range Rover,
sped up these crazy little--

00:17:13.422 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:84%
who's been in Topanga, they
were those crazy little roads.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went and picked
it up, because the owner

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
of the facility was going to not
appropriately put it out there

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:90%
in the best fashion.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.350 align:middle line:84%
It was going to be
unsafe, and he was just

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.260 align:middle line:84%
wanting to take it from
me and monetize it.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So went up and had scientists
there help me load it up,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
loaded everything up.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And Agent [INAUDIBLE],, he
was here with me during this,

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:90%
and we came down that mountain.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And we got in a head on
collision at 55 miles an hour

00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:84%
by a agent that was
sent out to kill us,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't work, because
my car was bigger than his.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So you answered a lot, but
who was the first person you

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.860 align:middle line:90%
told your secret to?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm working up to that.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So Greer and I and
Wilcock were sitting down

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
at a restaurant down there.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Inn of the Seventh Ray.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure if you've been to the
Topanga, you know where it is.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Inn of the Seventh Ray
down there in Topanga.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:84%
This is like, I don't
know, 12, 15 years ago.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I
first met David Wilcock.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:90%
And we became--

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> With Greer.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm?

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> With Greer.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:39.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, with Greer.

00:18:39.413 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about, hey, we're

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:84%
going to be making
this documentary.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:84%
You want to come on board and
be in it and all that stuff

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:90%
and hanging out.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:90%
And then we became friends.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- besides a
couple of my insider friends

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:84%
that already knew me, such
as a lot of my mentors

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:84%
and other scientific people that
knew about the projects that

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:84%
are also still in the projects
and some out of the projects

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
who knew about me, that we
started talking, Wilcock and I.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And then he started
asking me questions,

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and I started answering them.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But I just said, please
don't mention my name.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so this grew
over the last decade.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And he would
codename me all sorts

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.038 align:middle line:84%
of weird names in his
books and stuff and online.

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did he know how to
ask you these questions, though?

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Did you just ever
tell him who you were?

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Because there's a long--

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I remember out of
these 10 years,

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
I would ask Emery questions
and I would say, oh,

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%
is there a base here?

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.297 align:middle line:90%
And he would say yes.

00:19:50.297 --> 00:19:51.130 align:middle line:90%
So he would confirm.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I just, I would
ask him questions.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But it took me like, I don't
know why I never asked him

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
how he knew it.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:90%
I never asked him how.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:90%
We would be watching--

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
we watched "Resident
Evil" one day,

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
when I was like, how

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:90%
do you know this is real?

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.420 align:middle line:84%
What is your-- and then he
finally told me, oh, well, I

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:84%
used to work in
Sandia Los Alamos

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:90%
and this is what I used to do.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I just trusted you so
much for all the experiences

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
we had together, and I
just felt that knew so much

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that I would ask you
something and felt

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:90%
like you would confirm it.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And you were telling
the truth, but I never

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:90%
asked you how you knew.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:90%
So how did David know that you--

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.980 align:middle line:84%
how did he know that
you would have this?

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he knew Pete Peterson
and a lot of other people

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.967 align:middle line:84%
in the projects, and
they verified to him.

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
They did a big
background check on me.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah,
he is the real deal.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got papers published at
Stanford and all over Harvard

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and Ohio State University
with my systems

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.470 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So he put two and two together
and did their own vetting.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.090 align:middle line:90%
Gaia vetted me as well.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And thank you, Gaia,
for live streaming this

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.800 align:middle line:90%
and for all your support.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:02.490 align:middle line:84%
If you guys don't
know, Gaia is basically

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.780 align:middle line:84%
where I contracted out and
have these shows there,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and they just gave
me two new shows.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really excited.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.700 align:middle line:90%
So look forward to those.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.410 align:middle line:90%
Those are more scientific base.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not getting
around the question.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just telling you.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
I ramble and ramble.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, it was--
my students sometimes

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
I would let little
things slip out.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.510 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't really tell
anyone, because soon

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:84%
as you tell someone, then
you lose someone you love.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
They've killed my entire family.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:90%
They killed my dogs.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So I don't have relationships,
and I don't get too close.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And every time I do a movie,
they will kill somebody.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And when we did "Sirius,"
our director's father

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:90%
was taken out at his church.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.112 align:middle line:84%
He was a Sikh temple
priest in Wisconsin.

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Probably heard about the
shooting in Wisconsin.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:90%
So that was our direct--

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
So they're not going
to come after me.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:90%
They're going to come after--

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:90%
where's Sergio?

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come after
my director, my producer.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
come after Olivia.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
after people around me.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take me
out, I look like a martyr.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:90%
They don't want that.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But they want to emotionally
upset me and throw me

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:84%
off the tracks when we're
trying to make a documentary

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.390 align:middle line:90%
or if we're trying to--

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and there's a couple
times this past year

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.870 align:middle line:84%
they did come up to me and
say, hey, slow your roll.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they need me for
something in the future,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:90%
which is good.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
So I kind of have
a little something,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:90%
a little backup there.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:47.250 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing is they don't
care about me discussing what

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to just
discuss with you

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
with these underground
facilities underwater.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about me
talking about extraterrestrials.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't care about me talking
to you about the autopsies.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
They don't want me talking
about zero-point energy.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.130 align:middle line:84%
They don't want me talking about
regenerative medicine anymore.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's how-- no one's going
to believe me with this stuff,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.440 align:middle line:90%
they don't think.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
So who cares about that?

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But don't add in all
that other stuff, Smith.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So I know my limit of what
I can kind of tell everyone

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:84%
without getting my
team in trouble.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very protective
of my team in many levels

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:90%
that they don't even know about.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very hard thing.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.796 align:middle line:84%
So please give it up for my
team here, Sergio, Estes,

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.250 align:middle line:90%
Alejandro --.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.480 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Alice Rain back here.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Special Agent Jay over
here in the corner.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Watch that guy.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
He's already scanned
all your bags.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
for these people,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be
here, to be honest,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
because there's no way I
could do this on my own.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:90%
I cannot do it without you.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:02.760 align:middle line:90%
You are my team, all of you.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:90%
All of you.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about all the people
listening to this as well.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Because without you guys, with
these millions and millions

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
of followers supporting me,
it's like a safety shield.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
It's an etheric, energetic
safety shield around me

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and my team so we can keep doing
this and educate the world.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:90%
This is just a hobby for me.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not too--

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been through this with the
extraterrestrials and all this

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and I know people are like,
aren't you just like--

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
well, you kind of
get used to it.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm an engineer.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I want to get back in the lab.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.833 align:middle line:84%
I want to make things,
clean up this planet,

00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and do what really
needs to be done,

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:90%
which I'm doing right now.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting more and more
corporations involved

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and trying to get funding.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Because I have all
the answers for it.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.220 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting
the people that

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.410 align:middle line:84%
have the right heart and
the right consciousness

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to take this thing that
can cure you and not

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
put it in the closet.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Just buy it off
you and just say,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.280 align:middle line:84%
oh, we don't want that, because
we've got this pill for you

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
instead.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to
get them out of that

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, you can make
money off of these devices too.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what it's about.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It's about making the
money, unfortunately,

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to do other secret things,
which we're going to get into.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So it was probably
the first civilian

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.340 align:middle line:84%
really that opened up
to was David Wilcock.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.842 align:middle line:84%
So with that, then
you came forward,

00:25:36.842 --> 00:25:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and I guess we're
going to jump in,

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.230 align:middle line:84%
because I think everyone wants
to know about the facilities

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and what happened under there.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So where would you
like to go with this?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to talk
about your ETs, the portals?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could go
in so many directions.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:55.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was looking at this
picture they have up here.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:57.050 align:middle line:90%
And that is a--

00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.137 align:middle line:90%
>> That was underwater?

00:25:58.137 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
You want to talk
about the underwater?

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we'll do
underwater first.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of underwater
facilities located

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
around the planet, especially
in the Marianas Trench there.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a portal there
that the extraterrestrials

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
have been using forever.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.310 align:middle line:84%
So we have facilities
like the one you see here.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:90%
And we do a lot of--

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Gaia has an amazing group
of sketch artists and people

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.550 align:middle line:90%
that help me.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they listen
to me, ask me questions,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and they draw it out to the
best of my ability of my memory

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:39.450 align:middle line:84%
and do these beautiful
pictures here.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're very conscious
artists, by the way,

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.360 align:middle line:90%
and they really pick up on it.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like, man, it's
like those sketch artists

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
when they're drawing the
person who murdered someone.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they get dead on.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really
good connection.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of
the facilities that's

00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
down under that is monitoring
portals and monitoring

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:90%
ET activity underwater.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of extraterrestrial
craft are kept underwater.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a great place to hide.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're
interdimensional and some

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:84%
use portals and some don't,
because they can just

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.810 align:middle line:84%
enfold on themselves
and be somewhere else.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they've already
mastered the time space

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.910 align:middle line:84%
continuum and can
travel between worlds.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
other physics thing.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
in the seams class.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's one.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And let me see if
it comes up here.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:90%
I like this one.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.683 align:middle line:90%
This is interesting.

00:27:44.683 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe while you're
pulling up the next one,

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:84%
could you talk a little bit
about with these underground

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and underwater facilities, do
you know where you are when you

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:90%
go?

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And how do you get to--

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:90%
how would you get underwater?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, that's
the other thing.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.750 align:middle line:84%
People are like,
oh, well, there's

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.820 align:middle line:90%
two ways to build facilities.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You know how they build
the space station?

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.050 align:middle line:84%
They send up
different compartments

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
and then they connect
to each other like LEGOs

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you have this
big space station.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways they do it
is they drop these things down.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And depends how deep it is.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And they can assemble these with
underwater drone robotic things

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:84%
from the surface and make these
facilities underground just

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
by connecting them and
vacuum pressuring them.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And they can survive
there forever and ever

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:90%
and ever and ever.

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:10%
The other way is they
will drill under the sea,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.480 align:middle line:10%
under the sea ground,
and work from the bottom

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:10%
up is how they usually do it
with these types of cities.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, they have developed
a special magnetic field

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:10%
to withstand these
great pressures

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.590 align:middle line:10%
underneath these deep seas.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is it will
create this bubble of air,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.650 align:middle line:90%
and it's a very thick--

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I don't know the
science behind it,

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.780 align:middle line:84%
but it creates an
electromagnetic field

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.610 align:middle line:90%
that pushes the water out.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And then from
there, they release

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.070 align:middle line:84%
this gas and this substance
which makes this three to four

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
foot thick clear steel, it's
metal, but it's clear, dome.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they start
funneling things

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
from Florida and California
to these facilities

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:84%
underground by using
the same things

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:84%
they use the maglev tubes
where they're melting rock.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
These are very huge
interstates underground

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.140 align:middle line:90%
that go to these facilities.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.570 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.987 align:middle line:84%
So they're working
from the ground

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.920 align:middle line:84%
up usually is how
they do it, depending

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.120 align:middle line:90%
on how deep they're going.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the
questions that--

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
we were listening
to a talk yesterday,

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.840 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
questions I heard was,

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
where does all the dirt go when
they dig these facilities out?

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And is it because it's
just melted or do they--

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:06.100 align:middle line:90%
is there-- how would that work?

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.517 align:middle line:84%
Because we look
at Denver Airport,

00:30:07.517 --> 00:30:09.183 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
guys have been Den--

00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:10.897 align:middle line:84%
have you guys been to
the Denver Airport?

00:30:10.897 --> 00:30:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you're driving to
it, it's miles out there.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you notice, that
whole area is flat.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.050 align:middle line:10%
But there's these
big mounds of dirt,

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:10%
and they just kind of
came out of nowhere.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.573 align:middle line:84%
And it's fresh and they're
constantly digging.

00:30:22.573 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one of
the questions in a talk

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:90%
we heard yesterday was--

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and these underground
facilities are so deep.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Where does all the
dirt go when they dig?

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
How do they keep
it such a secret?

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.737 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, they do liquefy it.

00:30:32.737 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:84%
It's granite, usually
rock, not so much dirt.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.870 align:middle line:90%
And it is liquefied and melted.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And it looks like--

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the walls look like
obsidian, like glass.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.010 align:middle line:84%
And that liquid is
easily transported

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:52.180 align:middle line:84%
out using special vehicles,
anti-gravity vehicles,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and other vehicles very
quickly to the surface.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They're artificially
intelligent.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's AI.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.400 align:middle line:84%
They just run
consistently all day long,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing it right now
as we speak for other places.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.920 align:middle line:90%
So that's where it goes.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a very simple process.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's not noticed.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:90%
It goes unnoticed?

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Like they could be taking
a base right now and no

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:90%
one would be able to tell?

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, they have.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:84%
There's other spots
too where they

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%
can dump things on the way.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
Depends on how far they're going
and where it's at, number one,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
and how far the
actual facility is.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was not part of the
construction, by the way.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I just know this because of
I asked the same question

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to a couple contractors
that were involved

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.230 align:middle line:84%
with making the facilities
like the one that's

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.158 align:middle line:84%
down there by
Mountainair, New Mexico.

00:31:44.158 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's get back to
the underwater bases,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
since these are these photos.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is, I guess,
in an episode,

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
you spoke of having to
do procedures underwater.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.970 align:middle line:90%
And could you explain why?

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.130 align:middle line:10%
Why would you not just
put the being in a tank

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.200 align:middle line:10%
and operate in a regular room?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:10%
Why would you have to
be underwater as well?

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, some of the beings
come from water worlds,

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:10.780 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot of
beings that live here,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.170 align:middle line:10%
we call them aquafarians.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.570 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
code we use for that.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.580 align:middle line:90%
They live here already.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.680 align:middle line:84%
They've been living
here a long time.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But we do have visitors that
also come from very far away

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.220 align:middle line:84%
that their ships have liquid
in them of all different sorts

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.950 align:middle line:90%
of materials.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:40.480 align:middle line:84%
This specific one looks like a
mermaid man with little fins.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.920 align:middle line:84%
There's sometimes
that you cannot--

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.300 align:middle line:84%
people are like, why can't
you use those big tubes?

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't have the
visualization, number one.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:84%
So we actually have
operating rooms

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.610 align:middle line:84%
as big as this room
filled with sea water

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:02.660 align:middle line:84%
that we walk into with these
suits and take samples,

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.060 align:middle line:84%
because the bodies have
to be kept in the water

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:13.970 align:middle line:84%
or they'll deteriorate with
pure oxygen on the surface.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we cannot
use these little capsules

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.230 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
ambidextrous here.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You're talking very small
instruments and things

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:23.330 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:10%
This is a good
depiction of that,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:10%
and we have these special
boots that keep us,

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.570 align:middle line:10%
they're magnetic, that
keep us on the ground.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
contained in the suit.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is just one of
the artist renditions

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.747 align:middle line:84%
that I depicted for
them for this procedure.

00:33:43.747 --> 00:33:45.830 align:middle line:84%
So it has everything an
operating room would have.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just it's underwater.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times did you have
to do an underwater procedure

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:50.810 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Did you do them often?

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> No, maybe 5% of the ones
that I did you had to do in some

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:57.660 align:middle line:90%
sort of liquid or water.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.683 align:middle line:84%
And is this-- you can have
these rooms in a regular base,

00:34:01.683 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:90%
such as Sandia or Los Alamos

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.170 align:middle line:84%
These are not
always, by the way,

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:07.860 align:middle line:90%
in the underwater facilities.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:90%
These are actually on land.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:15.270 align:middle line:84%
They transport them
in special containers.

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:19.069 align:middle line:84%
I want to show them the
containers that we transport.

00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:20.069 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't have that--

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:23.962 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this is it.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we go to crash
sites and things,

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:90%
we have these giant capsules.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.969 align:middle line:84%
And they're filled
with different types--

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:34.489 align:middle line:84%
they can be filled with all
different types of gases.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.489 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to simulate the
atmosphere of the craft that

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.340 align:middle line:10%
came that crashed
so these ETs can--

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.750 align:middle line:10%
so we can save them.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.949 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of the
capsules when the Osprey

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:50.960 align:middle line:84%
VTOLs land that we transport
the extraterrestrials in,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:90%
whether they're dead or alive.

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're looking at
the inside of an aircraft

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.868 align:middle line:84%
with these capsules with
these beings in them.

00:35:03.868 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:90%
I think we have another one too.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you go to these
underwater facilities,

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.530 align:middle line:84%
do you know what part of
the ocean you're in at all?

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sometimes you do.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.015 align:middle line:84%
There's names for
these facilities.

00:35:18.015 --> 00:35:18.890 align:middle line:90%
They're all numbered.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:23.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This is a very good
depiction of a crash site

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
where the technician is trying
to resuscitate this being.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It was interesting, because
one of these beings that we're

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to resuscitate actually
breathe through a small area

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.040 align:middle line:90%
just below their sternum.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.750 align:middle line:84%
That's where their
breathing mechanism was.

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't the mouth
that we could do CPR.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:36:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And this being actually did
breathe our atmospheric oxygen

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.360 align:middle line:90%
at the same rate like we do.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So we had to resuscitate him
through this hole that was just

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.133 align:middle line:84%
below his sternum
there at the end

00:36:12.133 --> 00:36:14.880 align:middle line:90%
of the bottom of the sternum.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And right from there,
if we do save the ETs,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:26.520 align:middle line:84%
we put them in a special
type of ICU vacutainer

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.080 align:middle line:90%
that actually we can be in it.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit bigger than
the capsules you saw earlier.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be transported
to the nearest base

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.210 align:middle line:90%
or wherever they wanted to go.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:84%
My job is just to go there to
do forensics and also check

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:48.420 align:middle line:84%
the area to make sure that
there is no danger such as--

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.210 align:middle line:84%
we have these giant
systems that we

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.320 align:middle line:84%
plug into the ground and
special dishes and things

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.470 align:middle line:84%
like this that allow
us to measure the air.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.980 align:middle line:84%
We have air scrubbers out there
that measures parts per million

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:90%
of particulate matter.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So immediately, I
can know if there's

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.440 align:middle line:84%
a deadly virus or
bacteria in the air,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.370 align:middle line:84%
if there's a deadly
chemical before we even

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.630 align:middle line:90%
go near the crash.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So we have satellites, usually
three of our satellites

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
that are already set up.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:84%
They could be anywhere in five
minutes around the planet that

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:29.550 align:middle line:84%
are also helping us analyze the
craft, what's inside the craft,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.110 align:middle line:84%
is there any beings, any organic
material, are the beings alive.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.110 align:middle line:84%
We're getting all
this downloaded

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
in this special
type of iPad thing

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.900 align:middle line:84%
before we even arrive
to this crash site.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.723 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So were they able
to resuscitate him?

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:90%
The guy with the--

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And what would be the purpose
for that be to have his mouth?

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Was that just the way he
breathed was through--

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just, everyone--

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.250 align:middle line:84%
all these ETs-- all
these extraterrestrials

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:07.880 align:middle line:90%
are very different in biology.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And as being an
exobiologist and seeing

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:84%
all these different
types of things,

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.040 align:middle line:90%
I felt like a veterinarian.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Veterinarians are amazing,
because a regular doctor

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.490 align:middle line:90%
specializes in one thing.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.600 align:middle line:90%
No offense, docs.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:84%
You're a cardiologist
or you're an optometrist

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.268 align:middle line:84%
and you know all about that one
thing and some other things.

00:38:30.268 --> 00:38:31.810 align:middle line:84%
A veterinarian is
kind of like, learn

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:84%
all the species of the
planet and everything of how

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:90%
they work.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with
veterinarians for 25 years,

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:44.200 align:middle line:84%
because they use my technology
as well for stem cells and PRP.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So when I got into this, I found
myself down this rabbit hole

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:90%
here and seeing how different--

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
even though they have two arms,
two legs, and a head like we do

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some fins and
maybe some other things,

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.280 align:middle line:90%
they're not so different.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
But their internal systems
are completely different.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:19.110 align:middle line:84%
We had one being that had a
uterus that had four quadrants.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:22.750 align:middle line:84%
You know how your
heart has chambers?

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, this being only can have
children once in their lifetime

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:31.900 align:middle line:90%
and they have four all at once.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.820 align:middle line:84%
It was so fascinating
to see this,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:84%
because I did a lot
of OBGYN in surgery

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.760 align:middle line:84%
in my first year in
the military when

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I was stationed at
Eglin Air Force Base,

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.720 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
have too much going on

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.710 align:middle line:84%
until Desert Storm and
Desert Shield started

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:50.386 align:middle line:84%
and we were deployed there
30 miles north of Riyadh

00:39:50.386 --> 00:39:53.140 align:middle line:84%
at the air
transportable hospital.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
So I knew a lot about
the human body already.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And to see that they
have similar organs,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.610 align:middle line:90%
that they're just different.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they have four lungs.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.350 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they have six
lobes of the brain.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.947 align:middle line:84%
You guys probably see
the Atacama being online

00:40:11.947 --> 00:40:13.030 align:middle line:90%
with those pictures there.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:19.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very different
body somatotype than humans.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But needless to say,
one thing I can tell you

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is that all the ETs that
I've been involved with

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.525 align:middle line:90%
have human DNA.

00:40:29.525 --> 00:40:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.173 align:middle line:90%
And that was shocking.

00:40:37.173 --> 00:40:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
question I get, you guys

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:90%
probably heard me tell--

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.917 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how many have
been around the-- seen me

00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:43.580 align:middle line:84%
on the panel in the
last couple days.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Is Emery, are you
an extraterrestrial?

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:90%


00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And I smile, because
it's very funny,

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.000 align:middle line:84%
because we all are
extraterrestrials.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And we all have DNA
of certain percentages

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.420 align:middle line:90%
in our genetic makeup.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So we are different
extraterrestrials,

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but we have this
stardust in all of us.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, in
my opinion, that we

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.970 align:middle line:84%
are-- they are us
from the future,

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and they are here not to
destroy us but to protect us.

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Not to say there are not evil
extraterrestrials out there.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I only know one race of
evil extraterrestrials,

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and they're called humans.

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the
only extraterrestrials

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I know that chop each
other's heads off and post it

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.200 align:middle line:90%
on YouTube.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not right.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.660 align:middle line:90%
We shouldn't be like--

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.680 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't make sense.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:54.320 align:middle line:84%
It's not in our genetics
to fight, to be honest.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a program.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:03.170 align:middle line:84%
It's a program that has been
installed by organizations,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:08.450 align:middle line:90%
religions, political, TV shows.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Media is the worst.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Movies.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's an evil ET movie
put out every month

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:20.830 align:middle line:84%
to get you scared of the
giant octopus with 10 eyes.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:23.270 align:middle line:84%
He's gonna come
get you at night.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So for those of--

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.680 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of people
in this community that

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.650 align:middle line:90%
argue if there is--

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.900 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of people
that have different stances,

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and they really get into
the evil reptilian, Draco,

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.388 align:middle line:84%
Annunaki, people
eating, crazy ETs,

00:42:40.388 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and then there's those that
believe there's no bad ETs.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying you just
haven't experienced ones that

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:90%
seem to be as violent as us.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Or you really believe that there
is only good ETs or could you

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:52.610 align:middle line:90%
clarify that?

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, why are
you asking me these--

00:42:55.355 --> 00:42:58.007 align:middle line:84%
I don't like when you
ask me these questions.

00:42:58.007 --> 00:42:59.090 align:middle line:90%
But this is what she does.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotta clarify things.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:06.320 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, abductions.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Are they real?

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:84%
For that person,
they're definitely real.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And we can mind control you.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We can make you do anything,
make you think anything,

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
make you see anything, and
I will wake up in that bed

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.628 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh my gosh,
this happened to me.

00:43:21.628 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It did, and you can't
say nothing about it,

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:90%
because it's that real.

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.360 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Like the Stan Romanek
thing that's going around.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say
names, but I'm not

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:39.410 align:middle line:84%
gonna rat it out or
anything, but there's

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of also set up abductions.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.630 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
hoax abductions.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.653 align:middle line:84%
And they'll do it
here in Oklahoma,

00:43:50.653 --> 00:43:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll
do it in Florida,

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:84%
then they'll do it in Africa
and Japan and England.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And the journalists will go
to all these places, interview

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.770 align:middle line:84%
these people, and they all
have the exact same experience.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:08.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the exact same gray,
the exact same bright light,

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.690 align:middle line:84%
the exact same this,
this, and this.

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And the government
does have the ability

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:20.480 align:middle line:84%
to do mind control over
mass amounts of the areas,

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.100 align:middle line:90%
like a big city.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if any of you've
been to an airport.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Anyone been to an airport?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.690 align:middle line:90%
Two, three.

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.950 align:middle line:90%
A bus stop, bus station?

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a train station?

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've ever drove
a car under a street

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:90%
light that has a camera.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, they already
have your DNA signature

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:84%
if you fall under any
of those categories.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.080 align:middle line:84%
We all vibrate at a
different frequency.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They measure the frequency, and
it's stored in that database.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.245 align:middle line:84%
So at any moment, they
can send down a wave

00:44:54.245 --> 00:44:59.090 align:middle line:84%
through the whole planet
through these 20 satellites

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and stop your heart.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Just you.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:90%
Just one of you in the room.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.770 align:middle line:90%
Or all of us.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.333 align:middle line:90%
Or just a specific race.

00:45:10.333 --> 00:45:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like talking
about negative things,

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.736 align:middle line:84%
but you guys need
to be aware of that.

00:45:14.736 --> 00:45:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I'll probably get a lot
of crap for saying this.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people talk about
the negative ET agenda,

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.590 align:middle line:84%
you just never had-- you were
never exposed to that is what

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:31.080 align:middle line:84%
we're getting at, and you
don't-- do you believe that

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:34.410 align:middle line:84%
there are maybe a negative
race of ETs out there that are

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.940 align:middle line:90%
as crazy as people describe?

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Or do you just think
they're not there?

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if we exist, I'm sure
there are more out there that

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.360 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just we're not at a level--

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:44.490 align:middle line:84%
we're all-- they're
very compassionate,

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:48.000 align:middle line:90%
because they were once us.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone just
all of a sudden

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:55.920 align:middle line:84%
just was made or however you--
whatever your belief system is.

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you have to go
through this life of trials

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and tribulations and make
mistakes and get out of that

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and be truthful to the world
and be compassionate and do

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the best you can
while you're here,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to be
gone in a blink of an eye.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
be somewhere else again,

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.080 align:middle line:90%
if you choose.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe in
death is the last thing

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.930 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing left.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a greater
thing that's around.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:37.510 align:middle line:84%
You guys are all beings of light
made out of photons and atoms.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is a
crystalline structure.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Your energy will be in that
chair for 60 to 90 days

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:90%
after you leave it.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.570 align:middle line:84%
This has been proven
over and over.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:84%
You can read David's
books and Rupert Sheldrake

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and Tom Bearden, everybody.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.850 align:middle line:10%
So how does that happen?

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.020 align:middle line:84%
It happens because you're
everywhere all the time

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:03.870 align:middle line:90%
whenever you want.

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.060 align:middle line:84%
We're being stunted
a little bit.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.050 align:middle line:84%
We're being slowed
down, unfortunately,

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:12.750 align:middle line:84%
since 1895 when they
took Tesla's information

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.400 align:middle line:90%
and threw it away.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.933 align:middle line:84%
But that's OK,
because we're tough,

00:47:17.933 --> 00:47:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and we're going
to get through it,

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.183 align:middle line:84%
and we're just going
to keep moving forward,

00:47:21.183 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to keep
teaching what we can.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm sorry,
what's the question?

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you kind of
answered it, so it's good.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:29.760 align:middle line:90%
But to jump back to that.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:33.780 align:middle line:90%
So I'm interested.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.410 align:middle line:10%
In a few episodes
of "Cosmic," you

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:41.050 align:middle line:10%
said you performed procedures
on a reptilian race.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.328 align:middle line:90%
And what are you looking for?

00:47:42.328 --> 00:47:43.144 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:43.144 --> 00:47:43.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.335 align:middle line:84%
You said you
performed procedures

00:47:45.335 --> 00:47:47.715 align:middle line:84%
on a reptilian type race,
and you've experienced them.

00:47:47.715 --> 00:47:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So what were they actually
like in your experience?

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Because we hear so many
different things online.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.910 align:middle line:10%
That they're evil,
they'll eat you,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.830 align:middle line:10%
basically look at
you and kinda --

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I've never seen--

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:01.960 align:middle line:10%
I've never seen any
extraterrestrial eat anyone

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.090 align:middle line:10%
or one another.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I know cannibalism does
survive in the human race.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.318 align:middle line:90%
It's been proven.

00:48:09.318 --> 00:48:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's gross.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The reptilians I worked
with, and just so you know,

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.020 align:middle line:84%
when I reptilian, people are
always thinking that's just one

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:18.820 align:middle line:90%
race.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's like humans.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:26.090 align:middle line:84%
There's so many different kinds
of races in the human genome.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.032 align:middle line:84%
So we all look different
in different ways

00:48:28.032 --> 00:48:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and come from different
places, and we're

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:34.750 align:middle line:84%
a mish mosh of Europeans
and Americans and Spanish.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So you have to think of it
that way with the reptilians.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.460 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
kinds, and they

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.540 align:middle line:90%
look many different ways.

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that I've
seen are very tall,

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:47.320 align:middle line:84%
and they are kind
of intimidating

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.540 align:middle line:90%
looking a little bit.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:56.800 align:middle line:84%
They smell really
bad, which is--

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.725 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:48:57.725 --> 00:48:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are they here?

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.520 align:middle line:90%
Why would they be here?

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
they're working,

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and they're always making deals
with these compartmentalized

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:84%
project corporations,
exchanging information,

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and who knows what else
they're exchanging?

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I heard rumors of-- that's
secondhand information.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But rumors of bodies
being exchanged

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of fallen extraterrestrials
and things like this.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Big pharma I think
has a lot to do

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.930 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of these
specimens and stuff

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that I was testing
and harvesting.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.320 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of the
medications and proteins

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.680 align:middle line:84%
and synthetic recombinant stuff
that's out there on the market

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.400 align:middle line:84%
was reverse engineered
from proteins

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.040 align:middle line:90%
from other than Earth origin.

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of materials that
we've collected from space,

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:56.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a huge junkyard in
space of all these materials

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:84%
and actual bodies too that are
just floating around out there.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And we have a whole
fleet up there right

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:06.040 align:middle line:84%
now that's been there forever
that's a big salvaging.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It's like a salvaging business.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And they collect stuff and
send it back down to Earth,

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and then we'd look at it
and reverse engineer things

00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:23.080 align:middle line:84%
from it, from bullet proof vests
to better aerospace technology

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.310 align:middle line:90%
mostly.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:25.840 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes weapons.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you ever a part of that,
reverse engineering of anything

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.800 align:middle line:90%
from ET to what we use today?

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.400 align:middle line:90%
No, I never did any type of--

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:40.000 align:middle line:84%
my job was to take samples of
different types of materials

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:90%
that they have brought back.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't always tissue
samples, by the way.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.440 align:middle line:90%
It was equipment.

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, here, take
a piece of this.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And that was really interesting.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I got into
being on the teams that

00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:56.470 align:middle line:84%
go through the
portals, because I

00:50:56.470 --> 00:51:02.980 align:middle line:84%
had so much experience in seeing
different technologies that

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:07.810 align:middle line:84%
were not from here that if
I spot it on an Inner Earth

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.020 align:middle line:84%
mission or maybe
an outer planetary,

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.060 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
know where I was at,

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why
they had me on there.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Not just because of
my medical background,

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.270 align:middle line:90%
but because I could--

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:23.290 align:middle line:84%
if we did bump into
an extraterrestrial,

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.660 align:middle line:84%
at least I would
know what that is.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And after working hand-in-hand
with extraterrestrials,

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.270 align:middle line:84%
three specifically who taught
me the language of telepathy,

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:37.020 align:middle line:84%
because that's the main
language of the universe

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:43.870 align:middle line:84%
is actually telepathy, which
is an emotion based language,

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:45.050 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:49.840 align:middle line:84%
So I talk a lot about this
on a lot of the shows.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're working with
an extraterrestrial.

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:90%
And they can talk, by the way.

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.716 align:middle line:84%
They can make sounds
and talk depending

00:51:57.716 --> 00:51:59.700 align:middle line:90%
on where they're from.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.520 align:middle line:90%
They have vocal cords.

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
normal way they do it.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:11.290 align:middle line:84%
And one of my first experiences
with an extraterrestrial,

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:12.800 align:middle line:90%
it was at a board meeting.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And there was the
three of them that they

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.750 align:middle line:90%
said were going to be there.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:23.530 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of us, the rest
of the 20 other technicians

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and physicians, knew that
they were going to be there.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.010 align:middle line:10%
>> So they had confirmed
it, that basically ET--

00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:30.590 align:middle line:10%
like at this point, you had
just been doing autopsies,

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:33.260 align:middle line:10%
and they had just been freely
talking about the fact that ETs

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.930 align:middle line:10%
exists and you were like, wow,
I'm going to actually meet one?

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:40.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, this is two years after
getting a clearance upgraded

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.870 align:middle line:10%
every quarter after two years.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:48.830 align:middle line:84%
Then I was able to use
the library system,

00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:52.580 align:middle line:84%
remember, I speak
of and got to watch

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.370 align:middle line:84%
a lot of amazing
videos of other space

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:59.405 align:middle line:84%
travelers and portal
travelers and missions.

00:52:59.405 --> 00:53:01.935 align:middle line:90%


00:53:01.935 --> 00:53:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then finally realized that
these are extraterrestrials.

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:11.105 align:middle line:84%
When I signed up for the
after hours moonlighting job,

00:53:11.105 --> 00:53:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I really thought I was
doing organ harvesting

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.020 align:middle line:90%
for fallen soldiers.

00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But after my first
specimen, I was like,

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:20.090 align:middle line:90%
this is not human tissue.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.390 align:middle line:90%
This is not a piece of cow.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:25.890 align:middle line:90%
This is very different.

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, well,
just take that artery,

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:30.560 align:middle line:84%
put it in here, and send
it through the vacuum tube

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.720 align:middle line:90%
system in the room.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not allowed
to ask, what is this?

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to ask
where this being came from.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:41.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm not allowed to ask
any questions at all.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But after two years being in
the projects and doing my--

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.950 align:middle line:84%
keeping my mouth shut,
then they were starting

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:51.230 align:middle line:84%
to open up and say,
OK, we need you

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:55.820 align:middle line:84%
to go take a specimen
from this craft,

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.380 align:middle line:90%
and you'll be escorted there.

00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, a
specimen from a craft?

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:06.950 align:middle line:84%
That's where everything
blew my mind is seeing

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:11.300 align:middle line:84%
my first real
spacecraft that was

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:16.683 align:middle line:84%
organic and material like
Jell-O, like a memory foam.

00:54:16.683 --> 00:54:17.975 align:middle line:90%
And it was directly correlated.

00:54:17.975 --> 00:54:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It had the same DNA as the pilot
that we did the autopsy on.

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of being was he?

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Or she?

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was many of
them, but I'll just talk about

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:32.730 align:middle line:84%
the Jell-O being, the upside
down Jell-O cake, I call it.

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You know those Jell-O
molds sort of thing?

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Like flip one over.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.600 align:middle line:90%
And it looked like that.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.730 align:middle line:90%
About 50 feet tall.

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe at least 50
feet in diameter.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:84%
Had a center that was open
in the middle around 15 feet.

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.760 align:middle line:90%
It went all the way to the top.

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was transparent.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.850 align:middle line:90%
It was red.

00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The being was red also
and somewhat transparent.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like we see those
fish in the sea where you

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.680 align:middle line:90%
kind of can see through them.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You can see all
their guts and stuff.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.827 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.827 --> 00:55:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know how
they got in this craft.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
the being was dead.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:20.300 align:middle line:84%
But I was finally privy
to read the report that

00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:24.730 align:middle line:84%
said that this being
came from this craft

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and had the same DNA makeup.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> How did he get here?

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how it got--

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know how
where they took me

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:38.870 align:middle line:84%
through this maglev
little system.

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:40.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
where I was going.

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm thousands of
feet underground,

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm escorted by
two security guards,

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and I have a special band when
I get there they put on me.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So they know where everyone is
in the facility at all times.

00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you wander
off the course,

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:58.850 align:middle line:84%
you will either be terminated
or you'll be reprimanded,

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get
many reprimands

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.830 align:middle line:84%
before you are pushed out
of the projects permanently.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.840 align:middle line:90%
So you really have to obey.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a very strict,
disciplined the thing

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.964 align:middle line:90%
till you get to the cafeteria.

00:56:16.964 --> 00:56:17.964 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I ask a question?

00:56:17.964 --> 00:56:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Is it OK?

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure?

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever met
any Inner Earth beings?

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yeah, we're going to
get to that one for sure.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:26.967 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's a great topic.

00:56:26.967 --> 00:56:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I keep saying
he for this being,

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:31.580 align:middle line:84%
but was it-- did it have a
gender, this transparent, red

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:32.870 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial?

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:34.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was male.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.850 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the ETs
have kind of like-- they

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:39.560 align:middle line:90%
can replicate themselves.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:44.240 align:middle line:84%
They have both everything
to do that inside.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And some actually
go through stages

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.360 align:middle line:84%
where they might be a
male for the first 30

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.497 align:middle line:90%
years or half their life.

00:56:52.497 --> 00:56:54.830 align:middle line:84%
I won't say years because I
don't know the exact number.

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:58.247 align:middle line:84%
But half their life they'll be
one gender than the other half

00:56:58.247 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:90%
they'll be another gender.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They turn into
another gender, which

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.585 align:middle line:90%
is very common in the future.

00:57:03.585 --> 00:57:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if you can
answer this because you're not

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.870 align:middle line:84%
privy to all the information,
but what was the oldest

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:12.090 align:middle line:84%
extraterrestrial you ever
worked on or worked with?

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:14.390 align:middle line:90%
What were they like?

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.457 align:middle line:90%
>> My mother.

00:57:15.457 --> 00:57:17.505 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:17.505 --> 00:57:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Ha, ha.

00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Rest in peace, Dorothy.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one thing
we do take is we

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:32.055 align:middle line:84%
can tell how old you
are by doing a DNA test.

00:57:32.055 --> 00:57:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is something you can
go online and do right now.

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.500 align:middle line:90%
It's offered.

00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.030 align:middle line:90%
And cells too.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.880 align:middle line:84%
You can measure by the
looking of the cells.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.130 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a corporation
here in [INAUDIBLE] cell

00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.930 align:middle line:90%
testing.

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:45.540 align:middle line:90%
That was pretty cool.

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And it shows the integrity
of the DNA in the cell, which

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:56.030 align:middle line:84%
is kind of like how we do carbon
dating on archaeological stuff.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:84%
So we can actually
tell how old you are.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And some people,
it's interesting,

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:04.280 align:middle line:84%
are so healthy in different
parts of the world

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that they may be 30 years old,
but their DNA comes back 20.

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:10.970 align:middle line:90%


00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:15.390 align:middle line:90%
So this led us to believe that--

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and we already knew about
this a long time ago,

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.960 align:middle line:84%
but it's funny that
it came public now,

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:24.100 align:middle line:90%
which I think is pretty.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.960 align:middle line:84%
When we study DNA from
extraterrestrials, especially

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:30.590 align:middle line:84%
if we have multiple
extraterrestrials instead

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:37.670 align:middle line:84%
of just one, and compare all
the DNAs together, that we can,

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:46.380 align:middle line:84%
in a way, date how long this
being has been alive only

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.080 align:middle line:84%
for the extraterrestrials
that are

00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.950 align:middle line:84%
like within 2,000 to 5,000
years more advanced than us.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The ones that are above
5,000 years, their DNA

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:56.580 align:middle line:90%
stays the same.

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's
completely regenerating.

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.830 align:middle line:90%
The cells are perfectly healthy.

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:02.860 align:middle line:90%
They never get sick.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:07.705 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen tumors or
cancers or weird things.

00:59:07.705 --> 00:59:09.080 align:middle line:84%
There's some ETs
we have actually

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.180 align:middle line:84%
found that have disease
and things like this.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very
interesting question.

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can't really
tell by DNA how old it is?

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.370 align:middle line:84%
It would just-- they
would have to tell you

00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:24.290 align:middle line:84%
how many years they've
been alive, I guess,

00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.540 align:middle line:90%
whatever your time is to them?

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:32.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the extraterrestrials
that we've met 3D live anywhere

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:36.650 align:middle line:84%
from 500 years to a few
thousand years of age.

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We will be able to live
probably about 200 years of age

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.780 align:middle line:90%
in the next 50 years.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:48.890 align:middle line:84%
We will be able to live
to 400 years of age

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:53.840 align:middle line:84%
shortly thereafter, us right
now at this time, the way things

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.180 align:middle line:84%
are going with
regenerative medicine.

00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is after
about 400 years of age,

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.860 align:middle line:84%
even though your
body's perfectly fine,

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:12.020 align:middle line:84%
your brain starts
to not work so well.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't tell me how I
know this, by the way.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.920 align:middle line:90%
You cannot ask me that.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.990 align:middle line:90%
It's classified.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But they're trying to
fix that, but they can't.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And the brain just--

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.580 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand,
the brain is not

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the most regenerative thing
that you have in your body,

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll just say.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.560 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to
regenerate tissues forever.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:43.140 align:middle line:84%
That's what I do I've never
been able to anti-age cells.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And there is a doctor
down in Jupiter, Florida

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
who has proven this
by concentrating off

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:52.580 align:middle line:84%
a two macroglobulin,
which is A2M

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.410 align:middle line:90%
is a protein in your plasma.

01:00:54.410 --> 01:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to anti-age
articular cartilage and cells.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
What that means for us
as we can very, very soon

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.210 align:middle line:90%
be able to take this stuff.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It'll be approved in 10 years,
which is a very short time,

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
by the way, with big pharma.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.680 align:middle line:90%
It takes billions in dollars.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.440 align:middle line:90%
And it's a protease inhibitor.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So it basically
blocks inflammation

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
so the body can
actually heal itself.

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And everything or every
disease, every cancer,

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:32.248 align:middle line:84%
every car accident, every cut,
every wound you get always

01:01:32.248 --> 01:01:33.290 align:middle line:90%
starts with inflammation.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.688 align:middle line:84%
Now, inflammation's good because
it brings all your platelets

01:01:36.688 --> 01:01:37.730 align:middle line:90%
and growth factors there.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes inflammation also
slows down the body's ability

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.320 align:middle line:90%
to heal itself.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So they learned that
they can reproduce

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
tenocytes, which are the
little cells in your tendons

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.910 align:middle line:90%
and ligaments.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
The hardest cell to just
regenerate, they anti-aged it.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's like, right, oh my.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So we're going in
that direction.

01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Not that I want to be
here another 500 years.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.630 align:middle line:90%


01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, as long as I can
still stay looking good,

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll be all right.

01:02:16.410 --> 01:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned in
a lot of your episodes,

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned this library
that you learned a lot

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.610 align:middle line:90%
of your information on.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought
maybe we could

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.150 align:middle line:84%
start with that,
because then I'm

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:29.670 align:middle line:84%
sure that there was a lot of
things that you got to witness

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:30.870 align:middle line:90%
and read about.

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And maybe you could
start with what

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.507 align:middle line:10%
was the most interesting
thing you read in there

01:02:35.507 --> 01:02:37.590 align:middle line:10%
and what was something
that really stuck with you?

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
What was the most profound piece
of information you learned?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.425 align:middle line:84%
That was like my
most favorite place.

01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%


01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think probably watching
the videos of past explorers

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.150 align:middle line:84%
that were traveling to other
planets and Inner Earth.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:middle line:90%


01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.370 align:middle line:90%
It was like watching a movie.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It looked so fake.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.910 align:middle line:84%
It's just like, look
at these people.

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:16.760 align:middle line:90%
And they're there.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.313 align:middle line:90%


01:03:19.313 --> 01:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Here, let me show you.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%


01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Check that out.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.430 align:middle line:90%
Check that out.

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we were
doing 20 years ago.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And the team comes
into these portals

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.590 align:middle line:84%
and we go to these places
and harvest flora, fauna,

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:90%
all sorts of amazing things.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And I was just so
amazed and just so glued

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:52.297 align:middle line:10%
to the camera watching
every little thing,

01:03:52.297 --> 01:03:53.880 align:middle line:10%
because everyone has
a camera on them,

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:58.740 align:middle line:10%
and it was like really watching
real time these people that

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:03.810 align:middle line:10%
were doing this decades before
me, before I came along.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And then being
blessed to have been

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.520 align:middle line:84%
part of the actual missions to
go and collect these specimens

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.850 align:middle line:90%
and things and bring them back.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:18.900 align:middle line:84%
I talk about the leaf we've
collected that's bullet proof,

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and that was reverse engineered
to make certain things here

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:24.930 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And many things,
materials, I mean,

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:32.970 align:middle line:84%
many materials that
are on the planet now,

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:36.120 align:middle line:90%
especially that new one, the--

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.330 align:middle line:90%
what's it called?

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:38.870 align:middle line:90%
The graphene diamond one.

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, the diamine.

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Diamine.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, diamine.

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I spoke about this.

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you spoke about
on I think it is on "Cosmic

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Disclosure," of course, and you
spoke about a really thin suit

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that we got to wear
on this project.

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was so thin,
but it was bulletproof,

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and you could jump
extremely high.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You could jump like 20,
30 feet, and you could--

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:03.180 align:middle line:90%
and it would absorb your impact.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And so you can look this up.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
About a month after he spoke
about this on the show,

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.125 align:middle line:84%
this material came out, and
it was in like a science--

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I think it was in a-- i
don't remember what it was.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:15.690 align:middle line:84%
It was New York or something
and it's called diamine.

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:19.372 align:middle line:84%
And they mixed graphene
with it wasn't diamonds,

01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:20.580 align:middle line:90%
but you'd have to look it up.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was exactly the
material we spoke of.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's another company
you guys should look out

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.330 align:middle line:90%
to that does clothing.

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
Vollebak Sports,

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're usually integrating
technology with their clothing,

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
and they have these
amazing concepts.

01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And they have a jacket
called the graphene jacket.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And they say plain as day in
the description of their jacket

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.820 align:middle line:90%
it's a science experiment.

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.010 align:middle line:84%
And they said that it's
made out of two or three

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:44.980 align:middle line:90%
layers of graphene.

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:46.618 align:middle line:84%
And if they had
put eight layers,

01:05:46.618 --> 01:05:47.910 align:middle line:90%
it would have been bulletproof.

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.530 align:middle line:90%
So why don't we do that, then?

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
If we could do it,
why don't we do it?

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And it could save
us so much money.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's these things
that are out there.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.407 align:middle line:90%
The information's out there.

01:05:55.407 --> 01:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just done in
really weird ways.

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.778 align:middle line:90%
>> They made these--

01:06:00.778 --> 01:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%
I love talking about the suits.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:09.630 align:middle line:84%
They made us these suits to
do a mission in Inner Earth

01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:12.200 align:middle line:90%
through an aquifer.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And these suits you can run
really fast, jump really high.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:21.450 align:middle line:90%
And it monitors everything.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You can even poop and
pee in it and it's gone.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.360 align:middle line:90%
It transmutes it to nothing.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Like interdimensionally?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:28.534 align:middle line:90%
How would that--

01:06:28.534 --> 01:06:30.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:31.140 align:middle line:90%


01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Man.

01:06:32.828 --> 01:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to know
who's on the other end

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.440 align:middle line:90%
of that port hole.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:37.432 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:38.565 align:middle line:90%


01:06:38.565 --> 01:06:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> We've gotta liven it up.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
We're too sleepy.

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean portal.

01:06:43.230 --> 01:06:44.967 align:middle line:84%
>> But seriously,
how would that work?

01:06:44.967 --> 01:06:46.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where does your crap go?

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you wore it.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> For real.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We went to the bathroom
before that testing.

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:56.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it transmutes it.

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

01:06:57.450 --> 01:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
The suit's a smart suit.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.380 align:middle line:90%
It's artificial intelligence.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Reads your whole everything,
everything about your body.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It can be absorbed
into nothingness.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Transmutation of atomic
particles and structures

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
is how we're going to
clean the oceans up.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:16.493 align:middle line:84%
And this is stuff
that we're designing

01:07:16.493 --> 01:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
with other major
corporations right now

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:21.960 align:middle line:84%
to shoot these special waves
of energy into the trash

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
and it just turns it
to dust, to nothing.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.870 align:middle line:84%
The suit's able to absorb this
stuff, bring it to the surface,

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and take it out into the
air wherever you're at.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Not that you're
leaving stuff behind.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.684 align:middle line:84%
It's not its same atomic
structure anymore.

01:07:40.684 --> 01:07:42.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, OK.

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>> But the suits were just fun.

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.430 align:middle line:90%
It was really fun.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to make
the suits anti-gravity.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And we had something
that they needed

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:57.060 align:middle line:84%
really bad to make the
suits anti-gravity.

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
But what was so cool
is we needed the suits

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:03.570 align:middle line:90%
to get the stuff for them.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And we found five
acres of white gold,

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
powdered white gold
from biblical times.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't talk about--

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.760 align:middle line:90%
it's not gold.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not gold.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%


01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:21.319 align:middle line:90%
And this was used--

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
this is what Moses took out when
he left town and everyone ate

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:30.529 align:middle line:90%
some of that bread, remember?

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:33.680 align:middle line:90%
Guess what was in that bread?

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.785 align:middle line:84%
The manna, the white
gold, the powder.

01:08:36.785 --> 01:08:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you have all
those people walking up

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to an ocean or a
river, I guarantee you

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:46.262 align:middle line:84%
that that water will split
with that kind of energy.

01:08:46.262 --> 01:08:48.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that an ormus?

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No, ormus is different.

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:55.310 align:middle line:10%
Monatomic elements are
a little bit different.

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:59.779 align:middle line:10%
But it's a pure state of gold.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:01.910 align:middle line:90%
You guys can look it up.

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.939 align:middle line:90%
I won't get into that.

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:08.319 align:middle line:84%
But it has abilities
to make you--

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:14.620 align:middle line:84%
if you add it to material,
you can actually levitate.

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
So they needed that white gold.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.760 align:middle line:10%
So they customized some
suits for Olivia and I here.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.560 align:middle line:90%
It was really cool.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
They dropped them off
in these big VTOLs

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:27.342 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of nowhere.

01:09:27.342 --> 01:09:29.029 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you where it's at.

01:09:29.029 --> 01:09:32.727 align:middle line:90%
And they had a problem.

01:09:32.727 --> 01:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
We were just testing
the suits to make

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
sure they fit perfectly first.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.649 align:middle line:84%
We had a lot of testing before
we were going to utilize them.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was helping them make
the helmet for the suit.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And the problem was the
suit and the helmet just

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:54.170 align:middle line:84%
wasn't working, because they
had two different contractors.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:55.370 align:middle line:90%
One was making the suit.

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:57.320 align:middle line:90%
One was taking the helmet.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And it just didn't
work out correctly.

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:06.128 align:middle line:84%
And they got them working
now, but we were not able to--

01:10:06.128 --> 01:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
we did use the suits
for some things,

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
but without this
particular helmet

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
that we needed for the suit,
we could not accomplish

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.470 align:middle line:90%
this mission, unfortunately.

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.450 align:middle line:90%
And we had to abandon it.

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But that was fun
jumping off a cliff.

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Did they ever--

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.840 align:middle line:84%
did you ever experience this
white gold in the projects?

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something
that was part of a contract

01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
product years after you
got out of the military.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So did you ever
experience anything

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
like that while
within the projects?

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was lots of
levitation belts and lots

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:41.135 align:middle line:84%
of levitation devices to
carry heavy things around.

01:10:41.135 --> 01:10:43.850 align:middle line:90%


01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Levitation was just-- it
wasn't with white gold though.

01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
White gold is like the--

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the real white powdered
gold is so hard to find.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you see
in these Egyptian pictures

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:01.910 align:middle line:84%
of these goblets and
then you see this cone

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:04.910 align:middle line:90%
of white stuff on top.

01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:06.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the white mana.

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the white gold.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, the white gold's
very important, very important

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
for us, because it heals also
the body like ormus does.

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And ormus I do highly recommend
you take ormus every day,

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.423 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
born with those--

01:11:24.423 --> 01:11:26.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're born
with those elements,

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
but there's not too
many foods out there

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:34.220 align:middle line:84%
that actually have that
in them or you can just--

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:38.510 align:middle line:84%
your body needs that, these
monatomic elements in ormus.

01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps keep your
body at the right voltage,

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.050 align:middle line:90%
around 33 volts.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you are flying and
you're doing all this stuff

01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:52.990 align:middle line:84%
around electrical things,
your voltage is always off.

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And your body wants to
achieve homeostasis.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:11:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And so it's in this
constant fight every day

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.460 align:middle line:90%
trying to do that electrically.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
to drink clean water

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and to add minerals
to your water

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and eat healthy as you can
as possible as you can.

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so hard to do
that when you're on vacation.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's important for
the body to keep it

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.910 align:middle line:90%
at its optimal level.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:30.335 align:middle line:10%
>> So we kind of started this
with asking what was most

01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:32.210 align:middle line:10%
interesting thing you
learned in the library,

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and you mentioned a lot of
footage about these kind

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.330 align:middle line:10%
of experiences to Inner Earth.

01:12:37.330 --> 01:12:41.970 align:middle line:10%
And could you-- do you want to
talk about your experiences,

01:12:41.970 --> 01:12:43.290 align:middle line:10%
if you ever got to go?

01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Or what else did you see
through that footage,

01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:47.212 align:middle line:90%
and what did you learn?

01:12:47.212 --> 01:12:48.545 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, like this picture here.

01:12:48.545 --> 01:12:52.650 align:middle line:90%


01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
When we're going
through these portals,

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:56.940 align:middle line:84%
we bring the canine
units with us.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.220 align:middle line:90%
They have exoskeletons.

01:12:58.220 --> 01:12:59.250 align:middle line:90%
They're hybrids.

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
They're mixed with all
sorts of different DNA

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and raised underground to
smell certain chemicals

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
and to pick up on
certain vibrations.

01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So we get ready for possible
earthquakes, tornadoes,

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:11.490 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.740 align:middle line:90%
They have heightened sentences.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they don't
need suits where

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
we go because the atmosphere
is safe to breathe.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And some places, we
do need them there.

01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:24.390 align:middle line:90%
They're also trained to protect.

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:29.110 align:middle line:90%
They have circuitry in them.

01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
They are alive,
conscious beings.

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
They do have circuitry,
though, sometimes implanted

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
into the ears and brain
to help their extrasensory

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
perceptional skills
that is linked

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:47.100 align:middle line:84%
to the outside of the
suit so that they can hear

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:51.522 align:middle line:84%
Because they can pick up
things that we can't pick up.

01:13:51.522 --> 01:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever notice that?

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:54.870 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:59.400 align:middle line:10%
I mean, animals are
always-- regular doggies.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I miss my doggie.

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:06.380 align:middle line:90%
And so there was a time--

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.140 align:middle line:90%
can I talk about--

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
was that already released
with the crazy plant

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.730 align:middle line:90%
that ate the person?

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:13.790 align:middle line:90%
No?

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk about that.

01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:17.850 align:middle line:90%
It's in my next episode.

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:18.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:20.190 align:middle line:90%
So you got to see footage.

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And that was before
you even knew anything

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:22.890 align:middle line:90%
about Inner Earth.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
You just got to go to this
library and saw this footage

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and you were like,
what the hell?

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.630 align:middle line:90%
What's this?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was like, well, no.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
I knew right away.

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.480 align:middle line:90%
These are labeled.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They're dated and everything.

01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:42.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's like, this is quadrant
197854 and this is this

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.430 align:middle line:90%
and this is that.

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:44.820 align:middle line:90%
And they had these videos.

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.172 align:middle line:84%
And they also have
people wrote stuff.

01:14:48.172 --> 01:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
All the scientists would
actually write things.

01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:52.980 align:middle line:84%
When they get back, you
have to write a huge report.

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
You actually go into quarantine
for almost a week when

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
you get back to make sure you
didn't bring anything back

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.410 align:middle line:90%
with you that was--

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
but inside there, the
most amazing thing

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
is watching these
videos, reading

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
the experiences of these amazing
adventures of these people

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.880 align:middle line:84%
that have gone into
these Inner Earth portals

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.160 align:middle line:90%
and have come back.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's obviously been going
on for a very long time, which

01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that's what I was
impressed about.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
They've been doing this
even before I was born.

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And there was a lot of data.

01:15:31.410 --> 01:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
overwhelming amount of data.

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.220 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:39.360 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't believe this
really existed underground

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.985 align:middle line:90%
in Earth, its own biosphere.

01:15:42.985 --> 01:15:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that what they
referred to it as?

01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Did they refer in
their journals,

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:47.428 align:middle line:84%
did they call it
Inner Earth or did

01:15:47.428 --> 01:15:49.150 align:middle line:90%
they have another name for it?

01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> They called it--

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:52.060 align:middle line:90%
no, there's main terms.

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:53.378 align:middle line:90%
Biospheres, Inner Earth.

01:15:53.378 --> 01:15:54.420 align:middle line:90%
But they're all numbered.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
It was like, this is alpha
this, this is zeta that.

01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And using the phonetic
alphabet, it was numbered.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was many,
many of these.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
other impressive thing

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.270 align:middle line:84%
was how large these
pockets in the Earth were.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
There was some very small
ones that were maybe

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.180 align:middle line:90%
only 20 football fields.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And then there was other
ones that were miles long

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
and which have an end, but
they all have a dome top.

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a cavern with
stalagmites and stalactites.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.810 align:middle line:90%
It's not like that at all.

01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And what was so amazing
is the bioluminescence

01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
of all the chemicals
there that we've collected

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:46.970 align:middle line:84%
and the plants and
the animal life.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
They all had some sort of
bioluminescent capabilities.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And there was light
that was in the sky.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Not a sky, but on the top
with the ceiling of this.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It might be a quarter
mile high sometimes.

01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And we found out that
it's the moisture that

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:19.310 align:middle line:84%
has this glowing capability
that congregates in one area

01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and gives off a lot
of light, like a sun.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> With that kind of light,
did you cast a shadow?

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:26.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It was brighter than the moon.

01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it was bright.

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Some places were
eye piercing bright.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And they finally
figured out it was just

01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:41.570 align:middle line:84%
fog rolls in in California down
there in San Francisco Bay.

01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
But think of those particles
as little particles of water

01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:48.380 align:middle line:90%
but emitting light.

01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:52.130 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of them in one area.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And it stayed there
because of the pressure.

01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:56.740 align:middle line:84%
So it had its own
atmosphere too.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:58.370 align:middle line:90%
All the plants, everything grew.

01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:01.290 align:middle line:90%


01:18:01.290 --> 01:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The nutrient level and nutrient
density level of the plants

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.240 align:middle line:90%
was amazing.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
Because in Inner Earth,
like in the Marianas Trench,

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
it's so hot down
there where they have

01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.755 align:middle line:90%
the volcanic bubbles coming up.

01:18:17.755 --> 01:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And you have all his
life around there.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
We would be fried
in two seconds.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.810 align:middle line:84%
But yet there is life and
fish and eels and plants.

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And we learned through that
and through these projects

01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:36.020 align:middle line:90%
that we call it chemogenesis.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:41.900 align:middle line:10%
It's life from chemicals
of the earth like ormus.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually survive
in almost any environment

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
with just the right amount
of minerals and chemicals.

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:52.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't need sunlight.

01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't need-- you
don't even sometimes need

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to eat if you have the right
amount of nutrition that's

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:06.590 align:middle line:90%
in your cells.

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So was this your
experience in there?

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you go through
any type of training?

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And who was on your team and
could you describe a little bit

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.220 align:middle line:90%
about what that was like?

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, on my first
journey, you can't do anything.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.630 align:middle line:90%
You're the newbie.

01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So you just follow everyone
around and help everyone.

01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that was interesting.

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Just watching
everyone like this.

01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Get ready to walk
through these portals.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And we have equipment too.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.830 align:middle line:90%
We have lots of drones.

01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
tripod type beings

01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:45.850 align:middle line:90%
that can carry a lot of weight.

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
They're like robotic.

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.565 align:middle line:90%
Let's see if there's one here.

01:19:48.565 --> 01:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%


01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.330 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, so we have a
lot of equipment with us

01:19:56.330 --> 01:20:00.120 align:middle line:10%
and mechanical as well.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.110 align:middle line:10%
And we go there.

01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:02.670 align:middle line:10%
We set up these rods.

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And we have an AI unit that is
in contact with the personnel,

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
usually around seven
people, and made up

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:18.420 align:middle line:84%
sometimes of a geologist,
a botanist, medical.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we will have a
security, one security detail.

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We do know what places
we may encounter

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:34.440 align:middle line:84%
natives or other
extraterrestrial beings.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And we have a download
for those beings.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:38.830 align:middle line:90%
We all know what they look like.

01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
So we know what to expect.

01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
We are not allowed to
engage in that, by the way.

01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
If they come to us, we
are allowed to engage,

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
but we are not allowed
to engage in anything

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
to do with any beings
that may be conscious.

01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like
here now where we

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:02.108 align:middle line:90%
don't want to go to the Amazon.

01:21:02.108 --> 01:21:03.900 align:middle line:84%
We're crushing the
Amazon there and there's

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
natives there that have
never seen the outside world.

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
One of us could just
take them out just

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:15.232 align:middle line:84%
with our viruses and
our MRSA on our skins.

01:21:15.232 --> 01:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So they're doing
it the right way.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.220 align:middle line:84%
They're not going in
there and killing everyone

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:23.310 align:middle line:90%
and killing all the animals.

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.220 align:middle line:84%
We have found bodies there
that were already dead

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.070 align:middle line:90%
that we did bring back.

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:34.560 align:middle line:84%
We have found-- we have captured
animals from these places

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.110 align:middle line:90%
and brought them back.

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But we've never did
anything malicious.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:46.620 align:middle line:84%
We have seen tribes from a
distance, and they did see us,

01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happened.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.020 align:middle line:90%
They just kept walking.

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:52.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there like open
plains in Inner Earth?

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
What kind of climate
is underneath us?

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.347 align:middle line:90%
And what does it look like?

01:21:56.347 --> 01:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
People talk about
Inner Earth and they

01:21:57.930 --> 01:21:59.880 align:middle line:90%
it's hollow all on the inside.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:01.770 align:middle line:90%
What is the actual structure?

01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, according to
the material I saw,

01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that core is not a perfect
sphere, by the way.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It's always moving.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like a liquid
that it reminds me

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
of a blob that kind of can
grow tendrils out of it.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's always moving.

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why I think
the Earth's axis is

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.310 align:middle line:90%
going to switch here soon.

01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
It has something
to do with moving

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.840 align:middle line:90%
magnetic energies around.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.690 align:middle line:84%
In some of these
places, the gravity

01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:37.290 align:middle line:84%
is a little different, believe
it or not, in Inner Earth.

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And you might be a
little bit lighter.

01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You might be a
little bit heavier.

01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:46.860 align:middle line:84%
They blame it on how near it
is to the center of the Earth.

01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I believe it has to do
more with the spinning

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
of the axis of the Earth
and where that pocket

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:56.490 align:middle line:90%
is of that biosphere.

01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.235 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned you brought
animals back and specimens.

01:23:00.235 --> 01:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
What kind of animals
did you get to see

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:03.068 align:middle line:90%
when you were in Inner Earth?

01:23:03.068 --> 01:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could talk
about your first mission

01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:06.830 align:middle line:90%
and what was it like.

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:08.830 align:middle line:90%
Were you shocked?

01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:12.933 align:middle line:84%
And was it like anything
you'd seen anywhere else?

01:23:12.933 --> 01:23:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I was very shocked.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was overwhelming,
but I was very calm.

01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm very mission
oriented at that time.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And we were in and out very
quickly, in less than an hour.

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:26.190 align:middle line:90%
That's another thing.

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
There's only certain times
you can enter and get out

01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:31.118 align:middle line:84%
or you might become
stuck there forever.

01:23:31.118 --> 01:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
There have been teams
have never come back.

01:23:32.910 --> 01:23:35.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't know where they're at.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Just recently I was called up to
come back to do a contract job.

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, why do you need me?

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Why can't Colonel
so-and-so do it?

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And they said, there
was an incident.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And I lost about, I don't
know, five of my friends.

01:23:57.990 --> 01:24:00.820 align:middle line:84%
So they don't know
where they're at.

01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.685 align:middle line:84%
So it's not perfected
yet, the man

01:24:02.685 --> 01:24:07.020 align:middle line:84%
made portals that we have
made on top of the portals.

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it'd be best
interests for the planet

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that I stay here and help
you guys and get things

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:18.270 align:middle line:84%
going, because we're on a roll
right now instead of exploring.

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Which they're still
going to do it anyway.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:25.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
continue this way.

01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's options
for us in the future

01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to go to different places
and different planets

01:24:30.450 --> 01:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and to go to Inner
Earth or wherever.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:37.753 align:middle line:84%
We have the technology
to do it and it's there.

01:24:37.753 --> 01:24:38.670 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to--

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know when they're going
to release this information.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Probably right after
Antarctica is released,

01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:48.360 align:middle line:90%
which will be within a year.

01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And they're already talking
about it, of course.

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:52.270 align:middle line:90%
We found something.

01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that how you get to
Inner Earth is by a portal?

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Is there any way
we could access it?

01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:24:58.210 --> 01:25:02.393 align:middle line:84%
We have there's robotic type
snakes that are 10 feet long.

01:25:02.393 --> 01:25:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Remember the snakes
when you were a kid,

01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.102 align:middle line:84%
you hold it by the tail,
it's a piece of plastic,

01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:07.250 align:middle line:90%
and it looks like this.

01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:09.333 align:middle line:84%
Well, they look like that,
but they're really big,

01:25:09.333 --> 01:25:11.230 align:middle line:84%
and they're surrounded
by a special plasma.

01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And this plasma energy allows
them to go through crevices.

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And they have their own some
sort of efficient technology

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:26.350 align:middle line:90%
that allows it to run forever.

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So these things are dropped
into very deep places

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, oceans and
in caverns like Carlsbad

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and other ones in
the east coast.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And these things
will go and they'll

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.100 align:middle line:84%
find their way to this place
through very small areas.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's AI, so it
knows what it's doing.

01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
my little Roomba

01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that goes around the
room and chases Raven.

01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it does this, and
it's very intelligent,

01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:02.440 align:middle line:84%
and it comes back
with information.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:04.930 align:middle line:90%
And it knows where to return to.

01:26:04.930 --> 01:26:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And we get to see
everything it sees.

01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And those videos are
remarkable, because they

01:26:12.490 --> 01:26:14.890 align:middle line:84%
bump into different
sea creatures

01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:16.360 align:middle line:90%
that we've never seen before.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They bump into different life
forms we've never seen before.

01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of them
actually make it

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:25.150 align:middle line:90%
into these Inner Earth areas.

01:26:25.150 --> 01:26:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of these Inner Earth
areas, though, are completely

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:29.510 align:middle line:90%
sealed off, of course.

01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:34.493 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes these robotic
drones, these snake drones,

01:26:34.493 --> 01:26:35.410 align:middle line:90%
will make it in there.

01:26:35.410 --> 01:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not like "Journey
to the Center of the Earth"

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:39.807 align:middle line:84%
where you can go through a
volcano or something like that?

01:26:39.807 --> 01:26:41.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't work
like that at all?

01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:46.155 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't recommend
jumping into volcanoes.

01:26:46.155 --> 01:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So how long would it take
the snake to get to Inner Earth

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:51.170 align:middle line:90%
from the surface?

01:26:51.170 --> 01:26:55.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh gosh, these things will
go for years and then come back.

01:26:55.330 --> 01:26:58.370 align:middle line:90%
They're released all the time.

01:26:58.370 --> 01:27:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It has this really neat
gelatinous plasma over it,

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.010 align:middle line:90%
over the metal.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:06.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of spooky.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:10.180 align:middle line:84%
It's got this big green light on
the front of it like an eyeball

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and has an unlimited hard
drive in there made out

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
of a quartz crystal.

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And it records it through a
very, very, very small laser

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:26.820 align:middle line:84%
information and video
onto this quartz crystal.

01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a very thin,
square piece that's

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:36.790 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by this very strong
type of metal that they made.

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it's made
out of, but it's very strong.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's very-- well, I mean,
it moves better than a snake.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what they do
now is they learned

01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to copy Mother Nature and
the insects and the reptiles

01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:58.990 align:middle line:84%
and start building robotic
things that look like animals,

01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:01.885 align:middle line:90%
because they work the best.

01:28:01.885 --> 01:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%


01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
to see in the projects

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
these very neat, interesting
robotic things that you might

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:15.820 align:middle line:84%
be on a mission
and all of a sudden

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
you have to go do an
in service for a week.

01:28:18.460 --> 01:28:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing an in
service with a cybernetic type

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.810 align:middle line:90%
being, an AI.

01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of
spooky, because it's

01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:30.660 align:middle line:90%
like, they communicate with you.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And they can also
save your life.

01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Like when you're out there
getting eaten by a plant.

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:38.540 align:middle line:90%


01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.850 align:middle line:90%
You gotta see this episode.

01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it'll be--

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:46.060 align:middle line:90%
what's today?

01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:46.310 align:middle line:90%
Monday?

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:48.530 align:middle line:10%
Tomorrow's "Cosmic" Tuesday,
so maybe it'll be tomorrow.

01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:49.655 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe it'll be tomorrow.

01:28:49.655 --> 01:28:51.060 align:middle line:90%
With George Noory.

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>> George Noory
always represent.

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so was that-- so that
was your first experience

01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.580 align:middle line:90%
with the footage.

01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And from there, you get trained.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And how long does that process
take and what kind of people

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:04.230 align:middle line:90%
come with you?

01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.085 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
talk a little bit

01:29:06.085 --> 01:29:08.997 align:middle line:84%
about what your position was
and maybe your first experience.

01:29:08.997 --> 01:29:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I know that's a lot.

01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that was
the first experience.

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:17.060 align:middle line:84%
The second experience,
immediately you

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.880 align:middle line:84%
have a mission, collecting
samples, putting them

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.720 align:middle line:90%
in these small capsules.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We have many different
sized capsules.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:32.810 align:middle line:10%
Those go back to the AI, which
could be a big oval device that

01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:34.940 align:middle line:10%
is anti-gravity on it.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.040 align:middle line:90%
And it goes inside there.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're always going back
and forth in this little wheel

01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:43.040 align:middle line:84%
wagon thing and
putting things in there

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and collecting
all sorts of stuff

01:29:44.690 --> 01:29:50.990 align:middle line:84%
from dirt to flowers too little
reptilian looking things.

01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And insects, of
course, are very--

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:59.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the freakiest things
I saw was a large mosquito.

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was big,
like four feet.

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.830 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And it had a sound.

01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:07.920 align:middle line:90%
Those wings.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But it had the
dragonfly wings instead,

01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
and it had this huge
spike coming out of it.

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:19.520 align:middle line:84%
But it looked like
a mosquito to me.

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.100 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that spike
is there for mating or just

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.540 align:middle line:90%
for whatever.

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
little cubes a little

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.410 align:middle line:90%
bit bigger than this phone.

01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And we set these cubes out.

01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And they're made out of
a very special material.

01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk over it,
it shoots out a 30 foot net

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:46.205 align:middle line:84%
and surrounds whatever it is
and surrounds the being or not

01:30:46.205 --> 01:30:50.840 align:middle line:84%
the being but the
animal or the mosquito.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we collect it.

01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:55.795 align:middle line:90%
And it keeps it sedated.

01:30:55.795 --> 01:30:57.170 align:middle line:84%
It has a chemical
in there that's

01:30:57.170 --> 01:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
organic that keeps
it sedated, and then

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:03.410 align:middle line:84%
we bag them and tag them and
take them back home with us.

01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know--

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I never got to work on
anything that we ever captured

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and brought back home with us.

01:31:11.130 --> 01:31:13.017 align:middle line:90%
It's very compartmentalized.

01:31:13.017 --> 01:31:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned you took
samples of dirt and insects

01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:16.150 align:middle line:90%
and plants.

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Was the soil and the atmosphere
and your surroundings,

01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:21.875 align:middle line:84%
did it represent
anything that seemed

01:31:21.875 --> 01:31:23.000 align:middle line:90%
like it was on the surface?

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Was the soil different?

01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the soil was different.

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It had a lot more
nutrient content in it,

01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of course, a lot
more mineral content.

01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:36.590 align:middle line:84%
They also discovered new
types of minerals and things

01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
that they were able to make
different types of metals

01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
with, different types
of textiles and things

01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:45.490 align:middle line:90%
that we use today, I think.

01:31:45.490 --> 01:31:46.490 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know that?

01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Did you get to be
a part of that?

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that
because my friend was

01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:54.020 align:middle line:90%
part of the geological part.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:56.150 align:middle line:10%
And he said that
this has already

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:58.880 align:middle line:10%
happened in the
past where they were

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:03.020 align:middle line:10%
taking special types of
rocks and dirt and things

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:07.340 align:middle line:10%
and melting it and doing
many tests on it, which

01:32:07.340 --> 01:32:09.620 align:middle line:10%
I don't have any experience
with, by the way.

01:32:09.620 --> 01:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And they said they were
making these super metals.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:16.227 align:middle line:84%
They can make clear
metal, clear aluminum.

01:32:16.227 --> 01:32:17.435 align:middle line:90%
>> From Inner Earth material?

01:32:17.435 --> 01:32:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, from Inner
Earth materials.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And many large crystals
were down there also.

01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Megalithic, gigantic,
bigger than the selenite

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.080 align:middle line:84%
ones you see in Mexico
that you can walk on.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you guys
know about the selenite mines

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:33.390 align:middle line:90%
in Mexico.

01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Huge.

01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:36.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those are
like Redwood trees.

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.180 align:middle line:90%
>> So why is it so--

01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:40.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe it's not
extraordinary to people

01:32:40.340 --> 01:32:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that live there,
but why is it so

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:44.030 align:middle line:84%
rich in all of these
properties compared

01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:46.410 align:middle line:90%
to what's on the surface?

01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, because there's
no human interaction.

01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:55.130 align:middle line:84%
We are destroying our soil
and our oceans because

01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:59.420 align:middle line:84%
of the chemical factories
and because of our cars

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and because of how
this battery is

01:33:02.490 --> 01:33:09.100 align:middle line:84%
going to be disposed of next
year when I get a new phone.

01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:14.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's very sad, because it
doesn't have to be like that.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:19.980 align:middle line:84%
There's batteries that we
have developed that can--

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and we use the Tesla car
battery to do this, by the way.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Because all the testing was
already done at Stanford.

01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Stanford or University
of California.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:30.440 align:middle line:90%
One of the two.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] UCLA?

01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:33.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it was UCLA.

01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:33.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:40.660 align:middle line:84%
And we proved that
the same size battery

01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:47.190 align:middle line:84%
that they have in the Tesla
car that drives it to 220 miles

01:33:47.190 --> 01:33:56.370 align:middle line:84%
max, I think, that this
battery can drive, I think,

01:33:56.370 --> 01:34:00.920 align:middle line:90%
1,250 miles on one charge.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And they had to keep it
under a certain amount

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
because gas, coal,
and oil didn't

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.440 align:middle line:90%
want it to be for a whole year.

01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:13.620 align:middle line:84%
They could actually do
it for 100,000 miles.

01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Because guess what happens when
you plug your electric car?

01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
You guys have all your hybrids.

01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:22.600 align:middle line:90%
You plug it into what?

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.120 align:middle line:90%
The socket, right?

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Because we're saving money.

01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
We're saving all that carbon
coming up into the air.

01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:32.390 align:middle line:90%
But wait a second.

01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:34.740 align:middle line:84%
What's powering
that socket, guys?

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:40.813 align:middle line:84%
The power plant that's
shooting out all the crap.

01:34:40.813 --> 01:34:42.355 align:middle line:84%
So we're not really
helping anything.

01:34:42.355 --> 01:34:45.550 align:middle line:90%


01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:48.880 align:middle line:84%
For me, I just look
at this like, OK.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.940 align:middle line:90%
Recycling and all this.

01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.830 align:middle line:90%
There's better ways to do it.

01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
talk, and that's

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.520 align:middle line:90%
why I want the world to know.

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And scientists are
stepping up, finally,

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're coming out
with new inventions

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.460 align:middle line:90%
and new technologies.

01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want them to come out
and not have so much fear,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.660 align:middle line:84%
because it can happen
and will happen.

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just we can do it a little
bit faster if everyone just

01:35:18.190 --> 01:35:20.240 align:middle line:90%
does their part.

01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:23.355 align:middle line:84%
>> I know we're jumping around
a little bit, but I wanted to--

01:35:23.355 --> 01:35:24.480 align:middle line:90%
we spoke about Inner Earth.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned, I had
asked you a while ago,

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.380 align:middle line:84%
you said being around
ETs really changed you

01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:33.120 align:middle line:90%
when you're in their field.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had asked you if
the times that you spent

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.050 align:middle line:84%
autopsying or other
scientists if they felt

01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:43.800 align:middle line:84%
changed by being around these
beings and what happened.

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And you had told me
some interesting things

01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that take place when
you spent a lot of time

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:50.130 align:middle line:90%
around these beings.

01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:52.677 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you could
elaborate a little bit more

01:35:52.677 --> 01:35:53.760 align:middle line:90%
when you're done drinking.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.980 align:middle line:90%


01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Once in a while,
I'll take my team out.

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It's very rare.

01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:14.150 align:middle line:84%
But they deserve to be fed,
I think, every now and then.

01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:14.990 align:middle line:90%
They deserve it.

01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:17.960 align:middle line:90%
So I take them out.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're very serious people.

01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But we also know how to let
go and let loose and talk

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.600 align:middle line:84%
about things that are important,
like our families and things,

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.430 align:middle line:90%
and have fun.

01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you have someone
come into the room that

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is your friend and
they're very funny,

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.040 align:middle line:90%
you start feeling this energy.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:47.840 align:middle line:90%
You get excited.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.103 align:middle line:90%
My friends are here.

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we're going to go eat.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
do this or whatever.

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:54.080 align:middle line:84%
So being around an
extraterrestrial

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:57.350 align:middle line:90%
is very similar to that.

01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:59.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a very positive feeling.

01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It's an uplifting feeling.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.450 align:middle line:90%


01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:08.563 align:middle line:84%
You actually smile
for no reason.

01:37:08.563 --> 01:37:09.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
why I'm smiling.

01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:10.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm smiling.

01:37:10.220 --> 01:37:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking about my friends.

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:11.790 align:middle line:90%
So I'm smiling.

01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking about the ETs.

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:14.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm smiling.

01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like this
emotion that overcomes you.

01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And they always
are emitting this.

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It's always a positive
emission unless they're

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:32.880 align:middle line:84%
dying because they just
crashed or whatever.

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Then it's a totally
different emotion.

01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.910 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
working with them

01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:39.860 align:middle line:84%
was the biggest
blessing I probably

01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.350 align:middle line:90%
have ever had in my life.

01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Learning that we are going to
become them, that there's still

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be a
massive hope for us,

01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:57.140 align:middle line:84%
and they probably will also
eventually disclose themselves

01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:59.198 align:middle line:90%
at some point.

01:37:59.198 --> 01:38:01.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So they make you feel
really good being around them.

01:38:01.490 --> 01:38:02.990 align:middle line:90%
But was there anything--

01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the ones that you had
worked on in the autopsies

01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and maybe others like
you, did they ever

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:11.780 align:middle line:84%
get changed physically by
being in their presence?

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Was there any kind of
mutation to their DNA

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
by being around one for
so much of their time?

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they do emit energy,
like all of you emit energy

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and frequency.

01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And could be good.

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Could be bad.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I was inoculated 300 times
with extraterrestrial DNA

01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:34.670 align:middle line:84%
to work on bodies,
because if you do not

01:38:34.670 --> 01:38:38.570 align:middle line:84%
have the proteins
in your system,

01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:44.630 align:middle line:84%
your energy would
actually destroy the body.

01:38:44.630 --> 01:38:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The body would just
go into liquid.

01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:51.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a self destruct
mechanism that's

01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:54.570 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of different ET
races, believe it or not.

01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of ETs,
unfortunately we

01:38:57.020 --> 01:39:00.080 align:middle line:84%
found out later
on down the road,

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:04.447 align:middle line:84%
actually, we thought
they were dead,

01:39:04.447 --> 01:39:06.030 align:middle line:84%
but if they were on
their home planet,

01:39:06.030 --> 01:39:07.238 align:middle line:90%
they could have been revived.

01:39:07.238 --> 01:39:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It's just we didn't have
the technology to do that.

01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So someday I do believe
there will be a lot of ETs

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that they still have
put away that are just

01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the corpses that I do believe
will be able to be brought back

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:26.250 align:middle line:90%
from the dead.

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:29.640 align:middle line:90%
What we consider being dead.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
Their cellular makeup
is very different.

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that we
are trying to learn that

01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and we're also trying
to incorporate that.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So yes, there were side
effects to getting inoculated.

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
They don't do the
inoculations anymore

01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:49.890 align:middle line:84%
for the technicians
and the doctors.

01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:52.170 align:middle line:84%
They now have a
gel pad that goes

01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:56.280 align:middle line:84%
on the back of your
hand or your wrist

01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.870 align:middle line:84%
and it has the DNA
of that being on you.

01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:02.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, on you.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And then that DNA
transdermally goes into you.

01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm at this
frequency of this being

01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:15.800 align:middle line:84%
so I can operate it
and not destroy it.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.362 align:middle line:90%


01:40:18.362 --> 01:40:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And they learned
this the hard way.

01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen the
videos of physicians

01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
doing like in the really old
days, like big tables and just

01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:32.140 align:middle line:84%
really just taking
all the organs,

01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:36.290 align:middle line:84%
everything out and
putting it into the fridge

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:39.430 align:middle line:84%
or into the metal, and then
three hours later coming

01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and pulling it out
and it's all liquid.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't figure
out why this was happening.

01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:46.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was because of that.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So that was
through inoculations.

01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But was there anything--
just being around them,

01:40:51.190 --> 01:40:52.995 align:middle line:90%
did they ever mutate you?

01:40:52.995 --> 01:40:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I should ask
have you ever experienced

01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:00.910 align:middle line:84%
a shape shifting ET or one that
takes over the host of somebody

01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:02.515 align:middle line:90%
like you've heard about?

01:41:02.515 --> 01:41:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
anything like that?

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I mean, I
was never affected.

01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was
affected, but I only

01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:13.990 align:middle line:84%
had very short term
effects of that.

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:16.480 align:middle line:90%
I do believe it has changed me.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I do feel it has
given me an advantage

01:41:19.630 --> 01:41:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
extraterrestrials

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and also to be able to be more
conscious and more forgiving.

01:41:32.250 --> 01:41:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And they have taught
me a lot about don't

01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:39.560 align:middle line:84%
sweat the small
stuff kind of thing

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and that we are all protected.

01:41:42.150 --> 01:41:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And so it gave me a lot of hope.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the only kind of changes.

01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:49.930 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mutate or anything.

01:41:49.930 --> 01:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
There was a few times the
collagen in my nose and ears

01:41:55.710 --> 01:42:00.835 align:middle line:84%
and one time my teeth kind of
changed shape a little bit,

01:42:00.835 --> 01:42:02.960 align:middle line:90%
but that went back to normal.

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:04.535 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I didn't
want to lead you,

01:42:04.535 --> 01:42:05.910 align:middle line:84%
but I'm just going
to remind you.

01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:07.470 align:middle line:84%
So you told me this
story one time,

01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to tell it for you.

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:10.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fine.

01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You told me once that there
was a group of scientists

01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and they were working on
this one particular being.

01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:19.607 align:middle line:84%
And there was two
different stories.

01:42:19.607 --> 01:42:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with the way
that they would actually

01:42:21.690 --> 01:42:22.690 align:middle line:90%
change the way you look.

01:42:22.690 --> 01:42:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said that these
scientists actually

01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:28.200 align:middle line:84%
started to take on the
look of the being they

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.188 align:middle line:84%
were working on and vice
versa by being in their aura.

01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know if
you could have elaborated

01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:36.605 align:middle line:84%
on that story a little bit
more, because I always thought

01:42:36.605 --> 01:42:37.920 align:middle line:90%
that was really interesting.

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember
telling me about it?

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It was years ago you
told me this story.

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There was an extraterrestrial
that these physicians were

01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:46.750 align:middle line:90%
working on.

01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And as they were working
on the extraterrestrial,

01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:57.180 align:middle line:84%
they started to look like
the extraterrestrial.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.830 align:middle line:90%
But they were still themselves.

01:42:58.830 --> 01:43:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They were not the
extraterrestrial.

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I believe the
extraterrestrial somehow

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:07.950 align:middle line:84%
was trying to
communicate somehow

01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and was somehow
energetically morphing them

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:19.570 align:middle line:90%
into that lineage, I'll say.

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.260 align:middle line:90%
But they didn't stay like that.

01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.710 align:middle line:90%
They did go back.

01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But I remember them looking
up at each other through the--

01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:31.660 align:middle line:84%
we have these little spacesuit
things when we're working.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:34.300 align:middle line:90%
They were like, whoa.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:37.000 align:middle line:90%
Why are you looking like a frog?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:37.810 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird.

01:43:37.810 --> 01:43:40.680 align:middle line:90%


01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so that did happen.

01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And still can't figure it out.

01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
They think it had to do,
like I said, with the being

01:43:49.570 --> 01:43:54.820 align:middle line:84%
itself was part of
them, was trying

01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
to help them do whatever
they were doing.

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So would that have to
do with something like--

01:43:59.890 --> 01:44:01.838 align:middle line:84%
have you ever had an
experience, and again you

01:44:01.838 --> 01:44:02.880 align:middle line:90%
told me this a while ago.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.255 align:middle line:90%
I'm just trying not to lead you.

01:44:04.255 --> 01:44:05.055 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you can.

01:44:05.055 --> 01:44:06.204 align:middle line:90%
It's fine.

01:44:06.204 --> 01:44:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> You told me once that
there was a being and it was--

01:44:10.930 --> 01:44:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you'd worked
on multiple types of this being

01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:14.763 align:middle line:90%
or if this is just one occasion.

01:44:14.763 --> 01:44:18.310 align:middle line:84%
But it was able-- it had
this parasitic quality to it

01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:22.760 align:middle line:84%
where it was able to
take over other entities.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So it left the body
it was on the table

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and was bouncing around
the facility trying

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
to escape by taking over
other people's bodies.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Did that ever happen or
do you remember that?

01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:36.495 align:middle line:90%
>> That's kind of classified.

01:44:36.495 --> 01:44:38.120 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell them
everything, Olivia.

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.060 align:middle line:90%


01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the stuff, again,
I've asked him questions for 10

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:44.380 align:middle line:90%
years.

01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, he'll
just say, oh yeah,

01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:49.910 align:middle line:84%
there was this time where a
being took over another being

01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and was trying to escape to
the surface, and it was crazy.

01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:53.320 align:middle line:84%
We had to hunt him
down, but we didn't

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.200 align:middle line:90%
know what he looked like.

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.033 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was a host.

01:44:55.033 --> 01:44:59.980 align:middle line:84%
It could actually go into any
being's body and can jump out.

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of like--

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:06.580 align:middle line:84%
think of it as a light being
and think of the ethereal realm,

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:11.405 align:middle line:84%
the astral realm, that could
take over you, you, you, or you

01:45:11.405 --> 01:45:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and jump from you,
you, you to get over

01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:15.072 align:middle line:84%
to there and that security
guard and out the door

01:45:15.072 --> 01:45:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and get to the surface
and who knows what.

01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:24.730 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, it had this ability to
do that and then reform itself.

01:45:24.730 --> 01:45:28.160 align:middle line:84%
'Cause in the future,
we're all going

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to be able to change the
way we look to whatever

01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:33.220 align:middle line:90%
we want to look like.

01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.375 align:middle line:90%
And we'll all be able to--

01:45:34.375 --> 01:45:38.266 align:middle line:90%


01:45:38.266 --> 01:45:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I love you guys just
the way you are.

01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:42.610 align:middle line:90%
>> So pretty.

01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And really, you
might want to be a dog.

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:48.010 align:middle line:90%
You might want to be a cat.

01:45:48.010 --> 01:45:51.160 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
look like a human.

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You might want to
look like an ET.

01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to change your
atomic structure as you please.

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever experienced
that in the projects?

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever witnessed that
with something shape shifting?

01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:04.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it.

01:46:06.630 --> 01:46:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> This is one of
the beings that was--

01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:11.895 align:middle line:90%
it actually was a video.

01:46:11.895 --> 01:46:13.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see it personally.

01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.700 align:middle line:90%
But it was in the library.

01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And it could be
anything it wanted.

01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And it did escape, by the way.

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:23.780 align:middle line:90%
They could not contain it.

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.960 align:middle line:90%
But it was a light being.

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And I have a light
being that I'm

01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:32.530 align:middle line:84%
going to show at the next
conference the real picture.

01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I'll
probably put it up

01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:36.650 align:middle line:84%
on the website in
about four weeks.

01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:39.880 align:middle line:90%
So stay tuned for that one.

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.140 align:middle line:90%
And that was the Navy.

01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:45.130 align:middle line:84%
The Navy said it was the
most realistic picture

01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:49.090 align:middle line:84%
of an extraterrestrial that
a civilian has ever took.

01:46:49.090 --> 01:46:52.020 align:middle line:84%
They did not know it was
me that took the picture.

01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And it was on a CE5
from Boca Grande Island

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.860 align:middle line:90%
many years ago with Greer.

01:46:58.860 --> 01:47:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And it became a very,
very famous picture.

01:47:01.450 --> 01:47:04.925 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to have my-- huh?

01:47:04.925 --> 01:47:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> We can probably look
it up if you want to.

01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did is I had a
couple of my artist friends

01:47:12.490 --> 01:47:15.700 align:middle line:90%
do a rendition of it.

01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:18.040 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
see the real picture,

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.560 align:middle line:84%
and then I made posters
out of the picture,

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's really cool, because
it shows the heart chakra.

01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.840 align:middle line:90%
It shows the eyes.

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:30.900 align:middle line:90%
It shows the body.

01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:32.960 align:middle line:90%
And it shows pure light.

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Craft came up on the beach.

01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
There was 55 people
there witnessing this,

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and the beam came up and
went right in front of me.

01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.500 align:middle line:90%
12 inch sphere.

01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And the being's in the middle.

01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:46.450 align:middle line:84%
The being was in the
middle and a halo

01:47:46.450 --> 01:47:49.360 align:middle line:90%
around it of rainbow light.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said telepathically,
may I take your picture?

01:47:56.110 --> 01:47:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And the being said,
well, of course.

01:47:59.230 --> 01:48:01.780 align:middle line:90%


01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So I took the picture and
I have everyone memorize

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.890 align:middle line:84%
on my team about 300
questions before we

01:48:07.890 --> 01:48:11.700 align:middle line:84%
do our CE5s because if
you do get the chance

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to be in front of
an extraterrestrial,

01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:16.170 align:middle line:84%
those 300 questions
will be answered

01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:18.910 align:middle line:90%
in less than 0.03 seconds.

01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you're just standing
there crying and smiling

01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and looking like a fool because
you're like, what do I do now?

01:48:25.710 --> 01:48:29.042 align:middle line:84%
>> So speaking of CE5s, I don't
know if you guys know what that

01:48:29.042 --> 01:48:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is, but it's something called
close encounters of the fifth

01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:32.300 align:middle line:90%
kind.

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:35.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a protocol where you reach
out to communicate with them

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:37.290 align:middle line:90%
and to initiate contact.

01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was curious, during your
time in CSETI for the 10 years

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.750 align:middle line:84%
that you were there
and no one knew

01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
what your big secret of all
your experience, what was it

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.110 align:middle line:84%
like being a part of
that and making contact

01:48:49.110 --> 01:48:50.980 align:middle line:90%
with ETs in the civilian world?

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And did you utilize any of your
experiences from the projects

01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.270 align:middle line:84%
with that protocol
to make contact?

01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:59.840 align:middle line:90%


01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.260 align:middle line:90%
>> In the projects?

01:49:01.260 --> 01:49:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'm asking if your
experience in the projects,

01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:07.080 align:middle line:84%
if you had learned
anything and utilized it.

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I knew about
consciousness and telepathy

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and the science of all that.

01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And meditation helps
get into a state of mind

01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:18.580 align:middle line:90%
where telepathy is easier.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So I enjoyed-- and Greer
coined that term, by the way.

01:49:24.850 --> 01:49:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was just, it
was so beautiful to be

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.170 align:middle line:84%
around a bunch of
people that really

01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:38.712 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that much fear and
really wanted to reach out.

01:49:38.712 --> 01:49:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's like, well, why
don't they just come here?

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, why
don't we go there?

01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:47.088 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we reach out
and make communication?

01:49:47.088 --> 01:49:48.380 align:middle line:90%
How many have you been on CE5s?

01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:50.935 align:middle line:90%


01:49:50.935 --> 01:49:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I recognize a lot of you.

01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so it was very
nice for me coming out

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:04.305 align:middle line:84%
of the projects being able to
be around people like minded.

01:50:04.305 --> 01:50:05.680 align:middle line:10%
That's why I do
these things too,

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:08.420 align:middle line:10%
because you're
like minded people.

01:50:08.420 --> 01:50:10.360 align:middle line:90%
You showed up.

01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.740 align:middle line:90%
Just show up.

01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What was it like to pretend
like you had never seen an ET

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:16.930 align:middle line:84%
before when all these people
wanted to make contact and you

01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:18.070 align:middle line:90%
just had to--

01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't pretend.

01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.908 align:middle line:90%
I just didn't say anything.

01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I went on
board, all of a sudden

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:30.850 align:middle line:84%
they had amazing
influx of contact.

01:50:30.850 --> 01:50:35.620 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, look how fast
I went from photographer

01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to vice president to
autopsying of being

01:50:40.330 --> 01:50:43.270 align:middle line:90%
in CSETI in like a year.

01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:44.350 align:middle line:90%
They knew.

01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Greer knew.

01:50:45.230 --> 01:50:48.100 align:middle line:90%


01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.800 align:middle line:90%
He knew, he just didn't know.

01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:55.080 align:middle line:90%
But he consciously knew.

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And I had a great
connection with that person.

01:50:57.430 --> 01:51:00.000 align:middle line:90%


01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Because he's been doing it
forever, and it takes much

01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:05.900 align:middle line:84%
practice to keep doing
it over and over.

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.530 align:middle line:84%
It's always good to get a
good, small group of people,

01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:11.870 align:middle line:84%
even though we were just
training people to do it.

01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And photography, I
love photography.

01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It was fun.

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing a
lot of camera work.

01:51:16.810 --> 01:51:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I did run
security for him.

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.790 align:middle line:90%
But I also was on the board.

01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I was a board
member of his thing.

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I've never gotten paid by CSETI
or Dr. Greer for anything.

01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I volunteered all
those years and donated

01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:40.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of camera equipment,
bought all my own stuff.

01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:43.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was just an
amazing experience

01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:49.030 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with the ETs
using civilian equipment.

01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So I would use things
like trifield meters,

01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:56.710 align:middle line:90%
storm trackers, and cameras.

01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would have
the ETs every time

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:01.720 align:middle line:84%
they'd visit and train
them and re-circuit them

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:07.960 align:middle line:84%
for me so we could communicate
using certain devices that

01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.140 align:middle line:84%
was safe and effective for them
that the government could not

01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:17.530 align:middle line:84%
pick up on, which
was very important.

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Because our government
does not want--

01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:26.470 align:middle line:84%
only the US government does
not want any ET contact

01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with civilians,
because that will

01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:32.862 align:middle line:90%
disprove gas, coal, and oil.

01:52:32.862 --> 01:52:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Because the first thing the
scientists are gonna say, well,

01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:36.990 align:middle line:90%
how did they get here?

01:52:36.990 --> 01:52:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They didn't use
gas, coal, and oil.

01:52:39.090 --> 01:52:40.950 align:middle line:84%
That brings out
zero-point energy,

01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and now they just lost their
trillions of dollars of money.

01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:49.780 align:middle line:10%
>> So I'm curious if
CSETI was something, what,

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:52.510 align:middle line:10%
like 20 years after you
got out of the projects,

01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that during these
missions and these CE5s,

01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:58.270 align:middle line:10%
did you ever see any beings
that you'd seen in the projects

01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:01.420 align:middle line:10%
and recognized
them or that race?

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:03.970 align:middle line:90%
And did they recognize you?

01:53:03.970 --> 01:53:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:10.495 align:middle line:10%
There were a few ETs that
I was surprised to have

01:53:10.495 --> 01:53:19.450 align:middle line:10%
met on CE5s, especially
in Mount Shasta there

01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:25.090 align:middle line:10%
that showed up to say hi again.

01:53:25.090 --> 01:53:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
emotional for me to know

01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:31.480 align:middle line:90%
that they were listening.

01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:37.390 align:middle line:84%
ETs when you work
with them, they

01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:39.070 align:middle line:90%
know your energy signature.

01:53:39.070 --> 01:53:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's like they
know it forever.

01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they're
much more advanced

01:53:45.010 --> 01:53:48.970 align:middle line:90%
than we are with their bodies.

01:53:48.970 --> 01:53:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And not that they're
stalking me or anything.

01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:57.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- maybe they are.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.180 align:middle line:90%


01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, definitely that
happened twice to me.

01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
nice reunion to know.

01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:11.930 align:middle line:90%


01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
short communication.

01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And one time I had to
break away from the group

01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:26.060 align:middle line:90%
to go into the woods.

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
embarrassing to tell you,

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:31.310 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to tell you.

01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:34.245 align:middle line:90%
I had to relieve myself.

01:54:34.245 --> 01:54:36.500 align:middle line:90%
I drank too much water.

01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So I went into the woods and was
next to a tree, doing my thing.

01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, hey,
what are you doing?

01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.170 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, sorry.

01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:51.323 align:middle line:90%


01:54:51.323 --> 01:54:52.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was right there
next to the tree.

01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.981 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see him.

01:54:53.981 --> 01:54:55.745 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:54:55.745 --> 01:54:57.070 align:middle line:90%


01:54:57.070 --> 01:55:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, oh my
god, this is so funny.

01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying
you went to go pee,

01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and there was something in
the tree and you peed on it?

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I peed on my ET friend, yeah.

01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:10.007 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:55:10.007 --> 01:55:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It was an accident.

01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It was really dark.

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have my
night vision on.

01:55:14.410 --> 01:55:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Damn.

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.030 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:17.965 align:middle line:90%
>> How inappropriate.

01:55:17.965 --> 01:55:19.737 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so embarrassing.

01:55:19.737 --> 01:55:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's actually happened.

01:55:21.070 --> 01:55:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he say that in English,
like hey, what are you doing?

01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> What was he?

01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:25.880 align:middle line:90%
How old, how tall?

01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Please explain that.

01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>> He was small.

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:28.790 align:middle line:90%
He was four feet tall.

01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:30.000 align:middle line:90%
He was a small white.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And he was not--

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:37.840 align:middle line:90%
he had special clothing on.

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I really
did or he was just being funny.

01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.160 align:middle line:90%
But it was too close.

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like right there,
and I was like, oh my gosh.

01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Was he fully
materialized like in 3D?

01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he was totally
3D materialized there.

01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And him and his team
actually made a huge entrance

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.690 align:middle line:90%
after I went back.

01:55:58.690 --> 01:56:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was funny,
because it happened

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to two other people that
were there, including Greer.

01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:12.620 align:middle line:84%
When we went to go relieve
ourselves, they saw them.

01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So it was there was kind
of funny that they actually

01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:17.910 align:middle line:84%
made confirmation and
showed themselves to--

01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they hiding
in the trees?

01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> A new group of civilians.

01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Were they hiding in
the trees or something?

01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Why didn't you see them
when you went up there?

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they
materialized there.

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Their craft was-- we have
pictures of the craft.

01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:34.330 align:middle line:10%
It was outside the
circle, maybe 100 yards,

01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:35.508 align:middle line:10%
which they did show them--

01:56:35.508 --> 01:56:37.300 align:middle line:10%
they showed the whole
craft and everything.

01:56:37.300 --> 01:56:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We have it on
video and pictures.

01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But only three people actually
saw the actual small beings.

01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:47.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And what'd he look like?

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>> He was very human,
kind of elfin looking.

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Did he have hair?

01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:54.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he had hair.

01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:55.663 align:middle line:90%
He had a suit on.

01:56:55.663 --> 01:56:56.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not a business suit.

01:56:56.830 --> 01:57:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Like a very skin tight
suit that they wear.

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:04.000 align:middle line:84%
He had no helmet on
or anything like that.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.160 align:middle line:84%
His ears were a little
bit pointy, very small

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.275 align:middle line:90%
nose, very elongated face.

01:57:08.275 --> 01:57:10.930 align:middle line:90%


01:57:10.930 --> 01:57:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And this was one
of the beings that

01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:16.180 align:middle line:90%
was helping us in the projects.

01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:17.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was neat to--

01:57:17.990 --> 01:57:22.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't, of course, mention
that to the team at the time.

01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But I was just so
happy that they came

01:57:25.570 --> 01:57:28.850 align:middle line:90%
and they picked up on my field.

01:57:28.850 --> 01:57:30.280 align:middle line:90%
They can see me anywhere.

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like they have their
own little radar going on,

01:57:33.220 --> 01:57:38.290 align:middle line:84%
their sonar had like a dolphin
that they can pick up on.

01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:40.150 align:middle line:84%
It's like you know your
friend's coming over

01:57:40.150 --> 01:57:43.720 align:middle line:84%
or you're thinking of someone
and then your phone rings,

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:44.740 align:middle line:90%
and it's that person.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:48.210 align:middle line:90%


01:57:48.210 --> 01:57:50.105 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:57:50.105 --> 01:57:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So he recognized you
from the projects.

01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Did he say anything?

01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he says, why
are you peeing on me?

01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:56.598 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:57:56.598 --> 01:57:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have about five more
minutes until we're going

01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:02.250 align:middle line:84%
to open it up to questions
from the audience.

01:58:02.250 --> 01:58:05.172 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything you would
like to close with or do

01:58:05.172 --> 01:58:06.130 align:middle line:90%
you want to keep going?

01:58:06.130 --> 01:58:07.922 align:middle line:84%
I think it'd be important
to maybe describe

01:58:07.922 --> 01:58:10.790 align:middle line:84%
how we can make contact
with ETs on our own,

01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:13.010 align:middle line:90%
if you don't know how already.

01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So do you have any tips?

01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There's this
cool device, guys,

01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.900 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
coming out soon.

01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And we put it on your chest
and it scans your body

01:58:22.110 --> 01:58:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and shows your 3D holographic
image of your body.

01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And I can zoom in just to
your gallbladder if I want.

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.060 align:middle line:90%
I could do anything.

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's very small.

01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And we used this in the
projects for over 30 years now.

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.150 align:middle line:90%
And now it's coming real.

01:58:42.150 --> 01:58:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was actually
in a movie too somewhere.

01:58:46.890 --> 01:58:51.750 align:middle line:10%
I think was-- is it "Elysium" or
something where the rich people

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:54.030 align:middle line:10%
live up in space?

01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:55.330 align:middle line:90%
Is that how you say it?

01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw that
little thing you get in.

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And everyone will have
these self healing things

01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and they shoot frequencies
in your body too.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a
Scenar Cosmodic device.

01:59:06.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what
that is, I definitely

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:11.850 align:middle line:90%
recommend getting one of those.

01:59:11.850 --> 01:59:13.740 align:middle line:84%
>> The company is
called LET Medical.

01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, LET Medical.

01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:16.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we
recommend that you--

01:59:16.410 --> 01:59:17.730 align:middle line:84%
where would you
recommend people buy it?

01:59:17.730 --> 01:59:18.530 align:middle line:90%
Do you recommend--

01:59:18.530 --> 01:59:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you gotta get the
Scenar Cosmodic device from LET

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:25.865 align:middle line:90%
Medical from Germany and Europe.

01:59:25.865 --> 01:59:27.990 align:middle line:84%
If you're in Europe, you
can buy them there safely.

01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:30.780 align:middle line:84%
They just opened up
another place in Canada.

01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot have
it shipped here,

01:59:33.210 --> 01:59:37.400 align:middle line:84%
because they will take the
circuitry out of it if it comes

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:38.960 align:middle line:90%
through the US postal.

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:42.570 align:middle line:84%
They red line them
because they cure people.

01:59:42.570 --> 01:59:43.770 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:59:43.770 --> 01:59:44.728 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you spell it?

01:59:44.728 --> 01:59:46.260 align:middle line:90%
>> LET Medical.

01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, and what's the other?

01:59:47.570 --> 01:59:47.980 align:middle line:90%
The Sce?

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Scenar.

01:59:48.810 --> 01:59:53.970 align:middle line:84%
S-C-E-N-A-R Cosmodic
one is the one you want.

01:59:53.970 --> 01:59:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Scenar N Cosmodic.

01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't get just the Scenar.

01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.160 align:middle line:90%
That heals everything.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.840 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
the old rife machines

02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:03.330 align:middle line:90%
but it's super compact.

02:00:03.330 --> 02:00:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Gets rid of your
headaches two seconds.

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Helps heal tendons, ligaments,
and all sorts of things.

02:00:10.150 --> 02:00:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And these are stuff that's
out there that works.

02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:18.150 align:middle line:84%
I believe in all that stuff
and we use it on our team.

02:00:18.150 --> 02:00:20.200 align:middle line:90%
We've cured many things with it.

02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out with a
new device pretty soon,

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.340 align:middle line:84%
a type of Teslatron
unit that we've already

02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:30.130 align:middle line:84%
proven to cure cancers
and all sorts of stuff.

02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting
it approved is quite

02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%
difficult through the FDA.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to work
around that, because it's just

02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:44.796 align:middle line:90%
light therapy.

02:00:44.796 --> 02:00:46.548 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:00:46.548 --> 02:00:47.430 align:middle line:90%


02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:49.936 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I think we're
ready for audience questions.

02:00:49.936 --> 02:00:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to use
this microphone?

02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:58.220 align:middle line:90%


02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I would like to
ask about Admiral Byrd

02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:06.770 align:middle line:84%
and Antarctica describing
a whole land mass.

02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Have you been to Antarctica,
and what have you seen or heard

02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:12.140 align:middle line:90%
about Antarctica?

02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:15.890 align:middle line:90%


02:01:15.890 --> 02:01:17.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Test one.

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Antarctica.

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So, oh yeah, perfect.

02:01:22.570 --> 02:01:24.710 align:middle line:90%
With Antarctica, it's melting.

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
There's a craft
sticking up right now.

02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They've already
drilled a lot of holes,

02:01:30.630 --> 02:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing
it now in the news.

02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:37.350 align:middle line:84%
They're coming forward
slowly that there

02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a
civilization under here

02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:41.810 align:middle line:90%
that we did not know about.

02:01:41.810 --> 02:01:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And so you understand, they've
already known about this.

02:01:46.680 --> 02:01:48.850 align:middle line:10%
Germany has known
about this forever.

02:01:48.850 --> 02:01:53.670 align:middle line:10%
So this is not new news for
the underground facilities.

02:01:53.670 --> 02:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the stuff
has come from Antarctica

02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that we had in the
underground facility.

02:02:00.570 --> 02:02:04.230 align:middle line:10%
So I'm so excited,
because everyone's always

02:02:04.230 --> 02:02:08.010 align:middle line:10%
asking me, well, when's
disclosure going to happen?

02:02:08.010 --> 02:02:09.998 align:middle line:10%
How are you-- who-- huh?

02:02:09.998 --> 02:02:11.040 align:middle line:90%
And they get all excited.

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, Gaia
is going to disclose it.

02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:18.130 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to take
responsibility and guilt

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:18.930 align:middle line:10%
for that.

02:02:18.930 --> 02:02:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, not Gaia TV, by the way.

02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Gaia Earth is heating up
and showing these things

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:28.680 align:middle line:84%
sticking out of these
underground facilities.

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:29.680 align:middle line:90%
And they've been coming.

02:02:29.680 --> 02:02:32.425 align:middle line:84%
They've been going there, flying
there, and setting things up

02:02:32.425 --> 02:02:33.225 align:middle line:90%
and putting--

02:02:33.225 --> 02:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%


02:02:35.770 --> 02:02:37.950 align:middle line:84%
they're making a horrible
thing, because they're

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
taking Mayan stuff
and Egyptian stuff

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.707 align:middle line:84%
and are throwing it around
everywhere to discombobulate

02:02:42.707 --> 02:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
the National Geographic
guys when they go to there

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:48.340 align:middle line:90%
and do the big world discovery.

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're taking all
the really cool artifacts

02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:53.800 align:middle line:84%
out of there that show
that we're not from here.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.490 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know how they're
going to move this big ship.

02:02:56.490 --> 02:02:58.650 align:middle line:10%
That's what's going to be funny.

02:02:58.650 --> 02:03:01.500 align:middle line:10%
They better get that guy
out there, that magician,

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.610 align:middle line:10%
David Copperfield.

02:03:02.610 --> 02:03:03.885 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:03:03.885 --> 02:03:06.543 align:middle line:84%
Because it's bigger than
the Statue of Liberty.

02:03:06.543 --> 02:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So I want to see how
they're going to do that.

02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:09.335 align:middle line:90%
They're doing it now.

02:03:09.335 --> 02:03:12.550 align:middle line:10%
They're hiding it with
holographic images from space.

02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:14.400 align:middle line:90%
So the satellites can't do it.

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
But I know a couple
secret corporations

02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
that have just purchased
a bunch of satellites

02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:22.500 align:middle line:84%
and with the best
camera equipment ever.

02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to kind of
sneak over there and fly over.

02:03:25.770 --> 02:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
So they'll probably be
the first civilian group

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to release the real pictures.

02:03:31.930 --> 02:03:32.992 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:03:32.992 --> 02:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, excuse me,
this has been awesome.

02:03:35.310 --> 02:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a site?

02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I realize this
has been secret stuff,

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:41.190 align:middle line:84%
but do you have a site
or a book or something

02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:43.060 align:middle line:84%
where we can get a lot
of this information.

02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, emerysmith.net,
of course.

02:03:45.490 --> 02:03:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm very new at this.

02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I've been underground
for a while.

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:52.440 align:middle line:10%
But if you guys don't know,
I've just come out like a year

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:58.800 align:middle line:10%
and four months ago with all
this stuff from the projects.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:00.120 align:middle line:90%
But emerysmith.net.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Zerocross.co is our
production company.

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:07.450 align:middle line:10%
We're making a
awesome documentary.

02:04:07.450 --> 02:04:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Sergio, can I tell
them the name or no?

02:04:09.930 --> 02:04:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Can't tell you the name.

02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:14.777 align:middle line:10%
So stay tuned to zerocross.co.

02:04:14.777 --> 02:04:15.735 align:middle line:90%
Sergio is our director.

02:04:15.735 --> 02:04:19.620 align:middle line:90%


02:04:19.620 --> 02:04:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're making
this documentary.

02:04:22.020 --> 02:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
you guys with me

02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and show you what I've been
doing the last 15 years here

02:04:29.130 --> 02:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
with my GoPros
and my whole team,

02:04:33.330 --> 02:04:37.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to take
you to these beings that

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
have been reported to me.

02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to
get some specimens.

02:04:44.130 --> 02:04:47.270 align:middle line:10%
They have passed, but they
allowed me to get specimens,

02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:50.520 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to take
back these specimens here

02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.840 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to give it to
three different places to test.

02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.073 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't get
one specimen like we did,

02:04:57.073 --> 02:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
like with what I do
with the [INAUDIBLE]

02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:00.297 align:middle line:90%
and just give it to one.

02:05:00.297 --> 02:05:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Because look what happens.

02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:04.300 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's all confused.

02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it and
you do it the right way

02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
and then you compare
everyone, include

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:13.170 align:middle line:84%
all the scientific community,
not just one place, and say,

02:05:13.170 --> 02:05:15.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, what was your
results in the DNA?

02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:17.360 align:middle line:90%
What was yours?

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
What was yours?

02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is if
you don't include everyone

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific community,
people are saying,

02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:29.550 align:middle line:90%
no, that's all BS.

02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:32.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain way to
do it in the medical field

02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:34.500 align:middle line:90%
and in the science field.

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like double
blinded studies.

02:05:37.110 --> 02:05:39.190 align:middle line:90%
We've gotta do it right.

02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:42.595 align:middle line:90%
And we will.

02:05:42.595 --> 02:05:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Around 1989, 1990,
in the UFO community,

02:05:49.290 --> 02:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
we were hearing more about
the Dulce underground base.

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was rumored
that there was

02:05:54.930 --> 02:05:57.690 align:middle line:90%
two photographs smuggled out.

02:05:57.690 --> 02:06:00.810 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't see them,
but one of them they said

02:06:00.810 --> 02:06:04.650 align:middle line:10%
had aloe vera with hamster DNA.

02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I've heard you
talk about aloe vera.

02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to know, what's
so special about aloe vera

02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
and what were those photos?

02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:14.170 align:middle line:90%
Did it really happen?

02:06:14.170 --> 02:06:17.080 align:middle line:90%


02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> I did not see those photos.

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
But aloe vera feels really good.

02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.580 align:middle line:90%
Especially when I get a burn.

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So they are mixing animal
DNA, human DNA with plant DNA.

02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:33.750 align:middle line:90%
They've already done it.

02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:38.560 align:middle line:84%
They've grown all
sorts of crazy stuff.

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:41.010 align:middle line:90%
So that is happening.

02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And we're now
looking at plant life

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and taking everything
out of the cellulose.

02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:52.560 align:middle line:90%
And we noticed it's got--

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
like a maple leaf has veins
in it, just like we do.

02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So we can grow now the
matrix for arteries and veins

02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and things like this and then
inject our own stem cells

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and platelet rich
plasma into it.

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
So we can grow organs
from plant life.

02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:17.160 align:middle line:90%


02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Is all of the stuff that
you're involved in explainable

02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:25.980 align:middle line:84%
and understandable within
the English language,

02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:31.310 align:middle line:84%
or do you have to understand
other languages or even outside

02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of this planet other
languages to understand it?

02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Excellent,
excellent question.

02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.370 align:middle line:90%
It is very true.

02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot to talk about,
a lot to communicate,

02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:46.775 align:middle line:84%
but I cannot, because I
cannot express it in English.

02:07:46.775 --> 02:07:49.745 align:middle line:90%


02:07:49.745 --> 02:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't express it in any
language here on Earth.

02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%


02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

02:07:56.010 --> 02:07:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask you the question
about the ETs that you met?

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Did they teach you to
materialize things?

02:08:03.570 --> 02:08:05.400 align:middle line:90%
Objects?

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:06.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:07.610 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sound before form.

02:08:07.610 --> 02:08:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the monks have
been doing this forever.

02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:16.150 align:middle line:84%
They do it now with frequencies
making all sorts of objects.

02:08:16.150 --> 02:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just was out
there with David Adair

02:08:18.630 --> 02:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and we just had a
nice conversation.

02:08:20.250 --> 02:08:23.077 align:middle line:84%
And he's very
familiar with this.

02:08:23.077 --> 02:08:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Especially in
anti-gravity when you're

02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
in space, using frequencies,
you can make anything just

02:08:30.210 --> 02:08:32.190 align:middle line:90%
by playing it on a synthesizer.

02:08:32.190 --> 02:08:35.340 align:middle line:90%
You can make a material.

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:37.945 align:middle line:84%
You can make an apple
all through sound.

02:08:37.945 --> 02:08:40.470 align:middle line:90%


02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:42.780 align:middle line:90%
All the ships up there.

02:08:42.780 --> 02:08:49.070 align:middle line:84%
All the ET craft
are made from sound

02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:55.185 align:middle line:84%
and infused with consciousness
and are organic material.

02:08:55.185 --> 02:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is cool, because
I just had a question about have

02:08:57.810 --> 02:08:59.160 align:middle line:90%
you heard alien music.

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:01.960 align:middle line:90%


02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:03.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you say alien music?

02:09:03.970 --> 02:09:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:06.836 align:middle line:90%
I heard their music already.

02:09:06.836 --> 02:09:08.180 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:09:08.180 --> 02:09:09.980 align:middle line:90%


02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:11.890 align:middle line:90%
They're performers, singers.

02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Famous, these guys.

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, we have
heard and recorded

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:22.090 align:middle line:90%
many, many amazing tonalities.

02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:22.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's weird.

02:09:22.960 --> 02:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of going
to another country

02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:27.170 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

02:09:27.170 --> 02:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I went
to the Philippines

02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
and I was walking the streets.

02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I've never,
ever smelled that before.

02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:37.350 align:middle line:90%
No, in a good way.

02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, I thought
I smelled everything.

02:09:41.890 --> 02:09:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm traveling to
all these countries

02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:45.760 align:middle line:90%
and having my senses like, whoa.

02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then hearing
tonalities and music

02:09:49.690 --> 02:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
come from extraterrestrial races
even blows your mind even more.

02:09:53.890 --> 02:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like this overwhelming
like, wow, it's so beautiful.

02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how could I have
not heard this tone before?

02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And how was it made?

02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:08.740 align:middle line:90%
What did they do to make it?

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.480 align:middle line:90%
But yes, they have music.

02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And they have-- they do
sing and things like this.

02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And they have conviviality.

02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
They have get
togethers and stuff.

02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:22.840 align:middle line:90%
So they're just like us.

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:26.234 align:middle line:90%
They're just a lot nicer.

02:10:26.234 --> 02:10:27.686 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

02:10:27.686 --> 02:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%


02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:35.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Should we be concerned about
five or 6G coming out around

02:10:35.170 --> 02:10:35.970 align:middle line:90%
the world?

02:10:35.970 --> 02:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And if so, is there
something that we

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:39.970 align:middle line:90%
can do to protect ourselves?

02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Or are you involved with
trying to invent something?

02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:45.967 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's other
corporations out there

02:10:45.967 --> 02:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that are going to be coming
out with a bunch of tin foil

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.710 align:middle line:90%
hats and stuff if you want.

02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But the main thing I want you is
to not have fear about all that

02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:58.560 align:middle line:90%
and stay away from those towers.

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
bombarded with it anyway.

02:11:02.030 --> 02:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
They're bombarding you right
now with scalar interferometry

02:11:04.770 --> 02:11:06.180 align:middle line:90%
right now.

02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And the positive note is we
get stronger every decade,

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.820 align:middle line:90%
every lineage too.

02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:18.600 align:middle line:10%
Your child, and your
children's children's children.

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We keep getting stronger because
we build resistance to this.

02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want you to
think of it as a bad thing.

02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
It is a bad thing, but
you can turn this around.

02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
You can stop it with
your own frequency.

02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
manifest that yourself.

02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And that might take some time.

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:41.260 align:middle line:90%
But yeah.

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, first of
all, for being here

02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and doing what you do,
both of you, all of you.

02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a huge
blessing to all of us.

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:49.085 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:11:49.085 --> 02:11:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

02:11:49.980 --> 02:11:51.963 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

02:11:51.963 --> 02:11:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I just have a simple question
for you just after watching all

02:11:54.630 --> 02:11:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of this unfold is, are you
looking for any type of funding

02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:58.960 align:middle line:90%
at the moment?

02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:02.610 align:middle line:10%
And if so, if you can
maybe point us towards--

02:12:02.610 --> 02:12:07.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, yeah, definitely we're
looking for funding always

02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:12.120 align:middle line:10%
for our documentaries to
get the education out.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
We're looking for funding for
my self sustainable community

02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:24.870 align:middle line:84%
that Washington, DC is very
interested in building a center

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
to help the 500,000 veterans
that die every year waiting

02:12:30.330 --> 02:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to be seen and helping
the 40 veterans every day

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:38.550 align:middle line:90%
that blow their brains out.

02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And I told them that I
would do it all for free.

02:12:43.650 --> 02:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
of this is not just

02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to help the veterans,
of course, but it's also

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to show that we can do this
in a self sustainable way

02:12:54.630 --> 02:13:03.088 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the desert here
hopefully in the United States.

02:13:03.088 --> 02:13:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Somewhere in the United States.

02:13:04.380 --> 02:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It's very in the middle
of nowhere, I'll say.

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And then show that not only
does it give us a lot of jobs,

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:21.660 align:middle line:84%
but introduce devices
that are non-conventional,

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that the FDA will not
have control over,

02:13:26.130 --> 02:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that big pharma will
not have control over,

02:13:29.590 --> 02:13:31.800 align:middle line:84%
and that will make
so much free energy

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to have to type
it right back to gas, coal,

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:38.320 align:middle line:90%
and oil.

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh,
they were all there

02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
so upset with me.

02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:45.512 align:middle line:84%
But once I said,
well no, we're going

02:13:45.512 --> 02:13:47.970 align:middle line:84%
to be making so much energy,
we won't need it for the city.

02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:50.040 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Because then they
can bill for it.

02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
And then big pharma was like,
nope, you're not doing that.

02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.280 align:middle line:84%
FDA is like, you're not
using those systems.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.155 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, I need
you guys really bad.

02:14:01.155 --> 02:14:06.200 align:middle line:90%


02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
They make all his money
off the pharmaceuticals.

02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, I need you
guys to make me

02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
some very special
pharmaceuticals.

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, Smith, and
I said, there's this thing.

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It's 3,000 year old
ancient Chinese medicine.

02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an apothecary
at your local drugstore,

02:14:33.010 --> 02:14:36.250 align:middle line:84%
right next to you
in the drugstore,

02:14:36.250 --> 02:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
you have your pharmaceuticals
here and the apothecary here.

02:14:40.210 --> 02:14:43.810 align:middle line:10%
And you walk up and
you have a chance

02:14:43.810 --> 02:14:47.080 align:middle line:10%
to do colloidal
silver or amoxicillin

02:14:47.080 --> 02:14:48.470 align:middle line:10%
or at least have a choice.

02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:49.470 align:middle line:10%
You don't have a choice.

02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:52.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't get choices
in the mil- Doctors,

02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
you just have to
do what they say.

02:14:54.610 --> 02:14:57.370 align:middle line:10%
But if you actually
had a choice,

02:14:57.370 --> 02:15:04.810 align:middle line:10%
they did a study, the body
itself will pick this over that

02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:08.050 align:middle line:10%
even though you have
to pay $0.25 more.

02:15:08.050 --> 02:15:09.950 align:middle line:10%
They said, oh.

02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:14.500 align:middle line:10%
So we could charge more for
the pharmaceutical grade ginkgo

02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:16.270 align:middle line:10%
biloba.

02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:18.520 align:middle line:90%
Pharmaceutical grade.

02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:20.748 align:middle line:84%
But at least we're
getting better.

02:15:20.748 --> 02:15:21.790 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:23.470 align:middle line:90%
So include everyone.

02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Let them make a
little bit more money.

02:15:25.480 --> 02:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone's
going to benefit.

02:15:30.820 --> 02:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
We got to stop looking at
the corporations to destroy,

02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to take time
if we really want to do it now

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:42.070 align:middle line:90%
so we incorporate everyone.

02:15:42.070 --> 02:15:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's going to
cost money, lots of money.

02:15:45.670 --> 02:15:49.780 align:middle line:10%
So I need a team right
now to help me with the--

02:15:49.780 --> 02:15:53.770 align:middle line:10%
an architect and business
person and someone

02:15:53.770 --> 02:15:55.090 align:middle line:10%
to head up all this.

02:15:55.090 --> 02:15:57.490 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge undertaking.

02:15:57.490 --> 02:16:02.980 align:middle line:84%
We're just at the
beginning stages of this.

02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:07.720 align:middle line:10%
So I need to do a new
briefing, make a model

02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:11.560 align:middle line:10%
like you see when they
build the cookie cutter

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:15.137 align:middle line:10%
homes and all that stuff.

02:16:15.137 --> 02:16:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And yeah, so we are.

02:16:15.970 --> 02:16:17.095 align:middle line:90%
We're looking for all that.

02:16:17.095 --> 02:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So stay tuned on emerysmith.net
and zerocross.co,

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be letting
you know when

02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
this happens, because we're
going to need a lot of help.

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:32.200 align:middle line:10%
And if you have
big investors that

02:16:32.200 --> 02:16:34.600 align:middle line:10%
have capital work to
write to check right now,

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.139 align:middle line:10%
then please talk to
Olivia afterwards

02:16:38.139 --> 02:16:42.010 align:middle line:10%
here and get our information.

02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:47.110 align:middle line:10%
Because I have been
to so many dinners.

02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And these guys fly me
out in their private jets

02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and want to see my
overunity device.

02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:58.750 align:middle line:90%
$100 million check they want.

02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:02.472 align:middle line:84%
And they treat me to
a big steak dinners

02:17:02.472 --> 02:17:03.639 align:middle line:90%
and want me to smoke cigars.

02:17:03.639 --> 02:17:06.200 align:middle line:90%


02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:09.219 align:middle line:10%
And I just look at
these people and I say,

02:17:09.219 --> 02:17:12.080 align:middle line:10%
thank you so much for inviting
me out and doing all this,

02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:15.549 align:middle line:10%
but you are not conscious
enough to have this device,

02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:17.590 align:middle line:10%
'cause you're just
going to put it right--

02:17:17.590 --> 02:17:19.498 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

02:17:19.498 --> 02:17:21.889 align:middle line:90%


02:17:21.889 --> 02:17:24.107 align:middle line:10%
I said you're just
going to put it

02:17:24.107 --> 02:17:25.690 align:middle line:10%
in the garage next
to your Lamborghini

02:17:25.690 --> 02:17:27.910 align:middle line:10%
and show it off to your
friends, and that's not

02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:30.670 align:middle line:10%
where it needs to go.

02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:35.629 align:middle line:84%
This needs to be in the
hands of a corporation that

02:17:35.629 --> 02:17:38.134 align:middle line:90%
does not care about money.

02:17:38.134 --> 02:17:39.719 align:middle line:90%
OK.

02:17:39.719 --> 02:17:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And I will not give this
technology away to just anyone.

02:17:44.750 --> 02:17:48.290 align:middle line:10%
So I have a corporation
I'm dealing with right now

02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:51.559 align:middle line:10%
that we have put
it in a safe place,

02:17:51.559 --> 02:17:55.309 align:middle line:10%
and they're improving
it, and they don't want

02:17:55.309 --> 02:18:00.260 align:middle line:10%
anything, which is amazing.

02:18:00.260 --> 02:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And that will be released,
this information,

02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:05.270 align:middle line:90%
in about a year and a half.

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:06.480 align:middle line:10%
You're going to see it.

02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:09.080 align:middle line:90%
Already did it.

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:12.959 align:middle line:84%
20 scientists, four RED
cameras already filmed it.

02:18:12.959 --> 02:18:15.221 align:middle line:84%
So even if you shoot me
right now, go for it.

02:18:15.221 --> 02:18:18.170 align:middle line:90%


02:18:18.170 --> 02:18:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

02:18:18.980 --> 02:18:19.855 align:middle line:90%
It's going.

02:18:19.855 --> 02:18:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
out there, guys.

02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:22.064 align:middle line:90%
We did it.

02:18:22.064 --> 02:18:24.434 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:18:24.434 --> 02:18:30.600 align:middle line:90%


02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We have about
four more minutes.

02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
One more question, or do
you want to wrap it up?

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.410 align:middle line:90%
One more question.

02:18:37.410 --> 02:18:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:42.440 align:middle line:84%
My question is you learned a lot
about telepathic communication

02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
with alien races.

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:47.180 align:middle line:10%
How well are you able to
telepathically communicate

02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:50.180 align:middle line:10%
with humans or do you see
us being able to do this

02:18:50.180 --> 02:18:52.459 align:middle line:10%
in the near future?

02:18:52.459 --> 02:18:54.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, everyone's
going to learn.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.790 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can do it.

02:18:55.790 --> 02:18:58.190 align:middle line:90%
It is a learning curve.

02:18:58.190 --> 02:19:02.290 align:middle line:84%
There are some humans that
do know telepathy already

02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:04.290 align:middle line:90%
and are very good with it.

02:19:04.290 --> 02:19:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you have
love ones or family members

02:19:06.590 --> 02:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
around for a long time,

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.820 align:middle line:84%
the longer you're
around someone,

02:19:10.820 --> 02:19:12.889 align:middle line:84%
the more you resonate
with that frequency.

02:19:12.889 --> 02:19:15.680 align:middle line:84%
So I would train with someone
that you're around a lot

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:22.240 align:middle line:90%
first to do that.

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:24.570 align:middle line:90%
And that really helps.

02:19:24.570 --> 02:19:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Also if you are touching
the person when you first

02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
start off, holding
hands or whatever,

02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that also helps to
get to learn this.

02:19:38.510 --> 02:19:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And soon they are
making devices that you

02:19:42.350 --> 02:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
will put in your ear that
will help you transmit that

02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:47.360 align:middle line:90%
to another person.

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:49.693 align:middle line:84%
It won't go-- it's not like
a walkie talkie or anything.

02:19:49.693 --> 02:19:52.820 align:middle line:84%
It just helps the mind
get on the same frequency

02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:54.910 align:middle line:90%
as the other person.

02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't hurt the
brain or anything with EMF

02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:58.970 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

02:19:58.970 --> 02:20:00.740 align:middle line:10%
And they already
have these devices,

02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:04.000 align:middle line:10%
and they'll be coming
out, I think, very soon.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:07.580 align:middle line:90%
One more?

02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hi.

02:20:08.390 --> 02:20:11.570 align:middle line:84%
My question is regarding
the solar flash

02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and if you have any
information that you

02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:16.940 align:middle line:90%
might have seen on any of the--

02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
in the library that you
mentioned or from the projects

02:20:20.130 --> 02:20:20.930 align:middle line:90%
or--

02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We have multiple crafts
coming out of the sun.

02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:27.380 align:middle line:84%
The reason they shut down
all the solar observatories

02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
was not because of
some child pornography

02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:36.020 align:middle line:84%
guy in New Mexico on the
computer or something.

02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Because they shut down all
of them around the world.

02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So you mean this was
happening on every--

02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:46.260 align:middle line:90%


02:20:46.260 --> 02:20:47.060 align:middle line:90%
come on, guys.

02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

02:20:48.750 --> 02:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
No, these huge craft were
coming out of the sun,

02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:52.758 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't want
people to see it.

02:20:52.758 --> 02:20:54.800 align:middle line:84%
As far as the solar flash,
I don't get into that.

02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm not scared
about solar flash.

02:20:56.610 --> 02:20:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Solar flash is going to come.

02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:59.910 align:middle line:90%
So what?

02:20:59.910 --> 02:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not gonna sit here and worry
about this, that, or the other.

02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:05.557 align:middle line:90%
Time come, time comes.

02:21:05.557 --> 02:21:06.765 align:middle line:90%
Knock out all the satellites.

02:21:06.765 --> 02:21:10.783 align:middle line:84%
It'd be a little bit of
chaos for a little bit.

02:21:10.783 --> 02:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
My friends are like, I've
got 1,000 gallons of water

02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:13.760 align:middle line:90%
in my garage, man.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, the
only thing that's

02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
going to save you if
the world goes chaos

02:21:24.330 --> 02:21:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is this big fatty tissue
thing between your ears

02:21:30.060 --> 02:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and this big beating thing you
have right here protecting you.

02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Use this first when
you communicate.

02:21:37.850 --> 02:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Use this second.

02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:41.325 align:middle line:90%
Don't always use this.

02:21:41.325 --> 02:21:44.100 align:middle line:90%
This will mislead you sometimes.

02:21:44.100 --> 02:21:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Go down the wrong hole.

02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:48.951 align:middle line:90%
Love you all.

02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:51.306 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:21:51.306 --> 02:21:53.670 align:middle line:90%


02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your support
and thanks for coming.

02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:59.690 align:middle line:90%
