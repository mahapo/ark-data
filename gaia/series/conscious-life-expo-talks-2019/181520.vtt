00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's give a big hand to one
of the hardest working people

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.630 align:middle line:90%
in the field, Grant Cameron.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Alan.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.120 align:middle line:90%
This is new material.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you the
basics of this.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.862 align:middle line:84%
It's 70 plus modalities,
contact modalities.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to do an
article for the Free

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.545 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, their new book
on contact modalities.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain a little
bit how that came about.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I've got 90
minutes and 70 modalities,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:90%
so I usually talk very fast.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to skip over
some that you should know,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:10%
but basically if you've had
some sort of contact experience,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:10%
whether it's
channeling, mediumship,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:10%
talking to a dead person,
whatever, I'm going to show you

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:10%
today it's all the same thing.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.450 align:middle line:10%
And so we'll start
with this, and I

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.540 align:middle line:10%
will try to set the background.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:10%
I had my download
experience in 2012,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:10%
where I flipped from
the nuts and bolts

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:10%
to suddenly realizing I was
not only on the wrong train

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:10%
but in the wrong direction.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.580 align:middle line:10%
I was on the wrong
train and headed

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:10%
on a different direction.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And everything
started to make sense,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.747 align:middle line:10%
and this just came together.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:10%
It was unbelievable.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:10%
And I started putting
this together,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:10%
and this is a very short
presentation based upon what

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:10%
is going to be a longer thing.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to go
into the neurology.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.520 align:middle line:10%
There's been neurology done
on all of this kind of stuff,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.250 align:middle line:10%
and they're basically starting
to verify this is for real.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.260 align:middle line:10%
We can actually do
this contact modality.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:10%
We now, I think, are starting
to understand what's going on,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:10%
but you need to
know the background.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:10%
And what I call it is,
I call it shutting down

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.062 align:middle line:10%
the bubble machine.

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:10%
There's a woman by the name
of Jill Bolte Taylor, who

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:10%
is a neuroanatomist
from Harvard,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.370 align:middle line:10%
who talked about her analogy
was there's blue sky.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:10%
That's consciousness.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:10%
And from time to
time, the clouds

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:10%
will roll in, which is your
mind, which is your brain.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:10%
And because your brain cuts
off that consciousness,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:10%
your connection to all
the non-local conscious

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:10%
does not mean the
blue sky goes away.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.370 align:middle line:10%
And so what this is about is
figuring out how to, I say,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:10%
turn off the bubble
machine in your brain,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.310 align:middle line:10%
or to make the clouds
disappear so you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.980 align:middle line:10%
can tap into this
non-local consciousness.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:10%
It's all consciousness.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
There is nothing else
but consciousness.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:10%
So we go to start with the
impression that we have now is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:10%
that the mind creates
consciousness.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I would maintain
it's exactly the opposite

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.940 align:middle line:10%
around.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.887 align:middle line:10%
The consciousness
creates the brain.

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:10%
So you have this
sort of thing, and we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.823 align:middle line:10%
believe that if you have
an experience where you've

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:10%
talked to your dead
mother or something,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:10%
they'll say, well, you're
not in the normal reality.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.450 align:middle line:10%
Normal reality, what you see
here and now, what we share,

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.220 align:middle line:10%
that's real.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.350 align:middle line:10%
And if you happen to
talk to a dead person

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:10%
or have an experience
with an alien,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:10%
you're having an illusion.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.580 align:middle line:10%
You're delusional.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:10%
You're not in normal reality.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.420 align:middle line:10%
So here's normal reality.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:10%
Normal reality says
the world is flat.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:10%
We've believed this
for thousands of years.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.960 align:middle line:10%
It's quite obvious.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.560 align:middle line:10%
The world is flat.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:10%
You look out with your eyes,
and you say this is what it is.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:10%
It's flat.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:10%
And then when we suddenly
put somebody on a ship

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:10%
and they suddenly discovered
they don't fall off

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.032 align:middle line:10%
the edge of the Earth,
or we put astronauts

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.140 align:middle line:10%
up to take photographs,
then we suddenly realized,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:10%
no, the brain was wrong.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:10%
The world is not flat.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.100 align:middle line:10%
We just thought it was flat.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.900 align:middle line:10%
It was giving us--

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:10%
the illusion is the Flat earth.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:10%
The illusion is what the mind,
what the brain is telling you,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.653 align:middle line:10%
the same as the sun
rotates around the Earth.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:10%
We believed that for
thousands of years,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.487 align:middle line:10%
because it was very obvious.

00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:10%
The brain was
telling you the sun

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.120 align:middle line:10%
is rotating around the Earth.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:10%
When we started
to get more detail

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:10%
and moved outside what we were
just getting from the brain,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:10%
we suddenly realized
the brain is wrong.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.095 align:middle line:10%
The brain is making an illusion.

00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:53.220 align:middle line:10%
It's telling you the sun
is going around the Earth.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.132 align:middle line:10%
It's not.

00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:10%
The brain is telling
you the wrong thing.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.110 align:middle line:10%
So what you believe is
normal reality is wrong.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:10%
We have the ego, and I get
it to Jill Bolte Taylor.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:10%
If you look at psychedelics
or Jill Bolte Taylor,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.875 align:middle line:10%
this woman worked
in the brain lab

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:11.070 align:middle line:10%
at Harvard, who had this
left brain hemorrhage.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:10%
You suddenly learn where she
says the ego was turned off,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.745 align:middle line:10%
the little voice in the head.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.370 align:middle line:10%
When she had her left
brain hemorrhage,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:10%
she said it did
not just tone down.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:10%
It was like you took a
mute button and the voice

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:10%
in her head disappeared.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:10%
So the voice in
your head, the ego,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:10%
what you think is yourself,
is actually not there.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:10%
It's a creation of the brain.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:10%
When you shut that part of
the bubble machine down,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.125 align:middle line:10%
you suddenly pop
into real reality,

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and you realize
everything is one

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:10%
and everything is connected.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.068 align:middle line:10%
It is the brain that's giving
you the illusion that you are

00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:10%
separate from everybody else.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.370 align:middle line:10%
It's a creation of the brain.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.357 align:middle line:10%
Same as stress.

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:10%
Jill Bolte Taylor said when she
had her left brain hemorrhage,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:10%
stress completely disappeared.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:10%
It did not exist, which would
indicate that the brain is

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:10%
creating stress.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.822 align:middle line:10%
Stress really does not exist.

00:04:57.822 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:10%
It's a creation of the brain.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:10%
For whatever reason, it's
in this physical world.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:10%
Everything is solid.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, our normal
reality says this is solid.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.365 align:middle line:10%
We now know, the more
evidence we get, the more we

00:05:11.365 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:10%
realize the brain is wrong.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:10%
It is not solid.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.280 align:middle line:10%
It is basically all space.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.080 align:middle line:10%
It just appears the
brain is giving you

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:10%
the illusion that
things are solid.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:10%
They are not solid.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:10%
Everything has color.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:10%
We now know there is
no such thing as color.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's just a frequency.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.028 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing as color.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you start looking into
quantum physics and the stuff

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.112 align:middle line:84%
that they're coming
up with, we start

00:05:33.112 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to realize that the brain is
creating-- the illusion is

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:90%
what the brain is giving you.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.547 align:middle line:10%
When you shut the brain off, you
suddenly get into real reality,

00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:10%
and people who have
been in that field

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.163 align:middle line:10%
will tell you it is more
real than the real world.

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:10%
There is no "out
there" out there.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.750 align:middle line:10%
We now know that everything that
you see goes through yourself.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.190 align:middle line:10%
There's no "out
there" out there.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:10%
What is happening,
what you are seeing

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:10%
is happening within yourself.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:10%
It's not like you're
seeing something out there.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:10%
We now start to understand
that it's all in consciousness,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.000 align:middle line:10%
wherever that consciousness is.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:90%
The vision is inside yourself.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Moving film, we now know, as
Bashar channeling tomorrow,

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.957 align:middle line:84%
he first brought
this up, this idea

00:06:10.957 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that you think that
things are moving.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.570 align:middle line:90%
They're not moving.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.160 align:middle line:90%
You're getting still images.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.840 align:middle line:84%
The brain is making the
illusion that things are moving.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
It's still image, image,
image, image, image, image.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.370 align:middle line:90%
It's like a movie screen.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like running a film
through a projector.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing still images
that are being put together

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:10%
one after another, and
you get the illusion

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:10%
that things are moving.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:10%
This is a critical one
that we've actually

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:10%
now got with neurology.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:10%
We know that the temporal
and parietal lobe

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.780 align:middle line:10%
create time and space.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.953 align:middle line:10%
And I'll show you later
on some experiments that

00:06:42.953 --> 00:06:47.200 align:middle line:10%
have been done at
University of Pennsylvania,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:10%
where you actually shut down
the temporal and parietal lobe,

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:10%
and time and space
basically disappear.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.120 align:middle line:10%
You get this idea
that everything's one,

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.800 align:middle line:10%
and there is no
such thing as time.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:10%
And quantum physics
is also now stating

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:10%
that time and space
probably doesn't exist.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:10%
It's a creation of the brain.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:10%
What you think is normal
reality is not real.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.260 align:middle line:10%
And when you go
into these fields

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:10%
of talking to dead
people and having

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:10%
these out of body
experiences, that

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:10%
turns out to be the real world.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.540 align:middle line:10%
That's why Bashar
said we come to you,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:10%
the aliens come to
you in your dreams,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:10%
because now you're
in their world.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's the whole idea, that
the real world is out there.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:10%
It's not here.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:10%
The brain is
creating an illusion.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.870 align:middle line:10%
And the fear center,
Jill Bolte Taylor said

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:10%
when her left brain
was shut down,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.810 align:middle line:10%
until she had the operation
and her left brain

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:10%
started coming
back online, there

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:10%
was no such thing as fear.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.030 align:middle line:10%
It completely disappeared.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:10%
It did not exist, which means
it's a creation of the brain.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.700 align:middle line:10%
And the 5,000 stars, we
look out and we say, oh,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:10%
there's 5,000 stars.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:10%
We now know there's
more than 5,000 stars.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:10%
The illusion is there's
only 5,000 stars.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:10%
When you start to
gather other evidence,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.778 align:middle line:10%
you realize there's a lot
more to reality than what

00:08:03.778 --> 00:08:04.820 align:middle line:10%
the brain is telling you.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:10%
And the majority of what the
brain is telling you is wrong.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:10%
It is here to keep you in this
physical world to do its job,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:10%
but the real world is not
in the physical brain.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:10%
It's outside the physical brain.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:10%
This is just a thing,
this is a woman

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm dealing with now who
is dealing with greys.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a photograph just
taken a couple of days

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.350 align:middle line:84%
ago with an orb in the
corner of the room,

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and you can see the cat
is looking at the orb.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.578 align:middle line:10%
So animals can pick
up higher frequencies.

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:10%
They can smell things we can't.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:10%
They can hear things we can't.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:39.005 align:middle line:10%
And so you start to
realize that there

00:08:39.005 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:10%
are other things out there.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:10%
Just because you can't
smell things and see things

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:10%
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:10%
And that's where contact
modalities comes from,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:10%
is that people have
popped into this world,

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:10%
and they've been treated
as if they're crazy.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.427 align:middle line:10%
And they're not crazy.

00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:10%
They're actually popping
into what is real

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.660 align:middle line:10%
and moving away
from the illusion,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:10%
from the bubble machine.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, recently there's
been experiments

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.070 align:middle line:10%
being done with experiencer
people, which I applaud

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:10%
that finally we're starting
to talk to people who

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:10%
are interacting
with the phenomena

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.103 align:middle line:10%
rather than chasing videos
and stuff like that,

00:09:13.103 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:10%
that we're actually trying to
interact with the phenomena.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.937 align:middle line:10%
And they're doing
this whole thing

00:09:16.937 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:10%
with-- this is the guy that's
famous for this Atacama being.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.570 align:middle line:10%
And I can say this is a
separate story I'm working on,

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:10%
and I have my
paranormal lawyer here

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.760 align:middle line:10%
who's involved
with this with me,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:10%
is that there are four different
alien stories of bodies.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:10%
There's the alien autopsy.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:10%
There's the mummies in Peru.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:10%
There's the Atacama.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.078 align:middle line:10%
And then there's the
Roswell slide things.

00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:46.120 align:middle line:10%
And I can just tell you,
you heard it here first,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:10%
within a couple of
months you're going

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.732 align:middle line:10%
to hear one of these
stories is going

00:09:48.732 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:10%
to come racing back
to the forefront,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:10%
and we're going
to say it's real.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:10%
So they're doing this
thing, and they're basically

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:10%
said that even
though this being,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:10%
they're saying it had
seven genetic mutations,

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.572 align:middle line:10%
and it's the whole idea that
you are a victim of your genes.

00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:10%
You are a victim of
aliens, who are coming here

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:10%
to interfere with you.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:10%
You don't have any
part in your life.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:10%
You're just a cork
swimming down the stream,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.297 align:middle line:10%
going wherever the
stream takes you.

00:10:16.297 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:10%
And so they're doing this thing
where they're actually looking

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:10%
at the DNA of experiencers.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:23.930 align:middle line:10%
And Gary Nolan had
worked on this.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:10%
This is the Russian
one that was basically

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:30.190 align:middle line:10%
another one that was in Russia,
that had been looked at.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.750 align:middle line:10%
And the point of
this whole thing

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:10%
is what they're saying is that
this was a being that had seven

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:10%
genetic mutations or whatever
number he gave to it,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:10%
and that it's like a victim.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, what
they wanted us to do,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
they looked at this
thing, Caudate-Putamen,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and said that when experiencers,
UFO experiencers are tapped in,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:84%
this part of the brain
seems to light up.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:10%
And so the idea is, in
a materialistic world,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:10%
is to say, OK if that part
of the brain is lighting up,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:10%
then that's what's doing it.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.860 align:middle line:10%
The brain is creating
this experience.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And so this is big.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:10%
This is on the news now.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.780 align:middle line:10%
There's a lecture at Harvard
University Gary Nolan got,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:10%
and they're basically talking
about this part of the brain

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:10%
that they think is what's
creating the psychic stuff

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.440 align:middle line:10%
that experiencers are having.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.740 align:middle line:10%
And because they
believe in this idea

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.310 align:middle line:10%
that it's a malicious contact
event, that aliens are messing

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.973 align:middle line:10%
with us, actually the
end result of this is,

00:11:32.973 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:10%
what they want to
do is, they want

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:10%
to find out what gene the
aliens are messing around with,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:10%
and they're going
to create a drug,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and that's going to stop
the aliens from actually

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:10%
interacting with the people.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And so it goes back to
this materialistic paradigm

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.492 align:middle line:10%
that we are victims, that
we are a victim of our genes

00:11:46.492 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:10%
and this sort of thing.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.075 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm going to talk about
today is exactly the opposite.

00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:51.340 align:middle line:10%
It's upside-down thinking.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:10%
It's the other way around.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:10%
So that's to give
you a background.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:10%
What I'm saying is,
consciousness, my definition

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, is awareness.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:10%
Which means everything
is conscious.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:middle line:10%
Particles are conscious.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Trees are conscious.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.520 align:middle line:10%
Everything that's
aware, they seem

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:10%
to know what they're
supposed to do,

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:10%
they play a part in a bigger--

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:10%
like a beehive, or
a cell knows what

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:10%
it's supposed to do
inside the human body.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.360 align:middle line:10%
A bee knows what it wants
to do inside the hive.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:10%
And it's this idea that
consciousness is awareness.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.800 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that
you need a US passport.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean you
have to be self-aware.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.751 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean any
of that kind of stuff.

00:12:26.751 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:10%
It just means awareness.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:10%
Everything in the
universe is aware,

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:10%
and anybody who's
had the contact

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.790 align:middle line:10%
modality of a psychedelic
experience will tell you,

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:10%
my ego was crushed
and I suddenly

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:10%
realized that everything
was conscious and alive.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:10%
That's the real world.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.930 align:middle line:10%
And the brain is giving you
a different type of world.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:10%
So this goes back
to the other two

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:10%
people that are working on this
stuff with the experiencers,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:10%
are Hal Puthoff
off and Kit Green.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:10%
And they knew right from--

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.740 align:middle line:10%
they've known back
since the 1970s,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:10%
because they worked on the
remote viewing program.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.823 align:middle line:10%
And the remote viewing
program, Paula Harris

00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:02.697 align:middle line:10%
has got her remote viewing
session this November,

00:13:02.697 --> 00:13:04.155 align:middle line:10%
and she's bringing
in Russell Targ.

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:10%
And Russell Targ
said quite clearly,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:10%
it is as easy to remote view
in the past and the future

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:10%
as it is in the present moment.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.980 align:middle line:10%
It is as easy to remote view
on the other side of the Earth

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.570 align:middle line:10%
as it is in the next room.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.580 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is non-local.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.260 align:middle line:10%
It does not obey
time and space time

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:24.270 align:middle line:10%
and space are illusions that are
created by the physical brain.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:10%
So these guys got involved
in this whole thing.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:29.120 align:middle line:10%
And I remember I wrote a
book called "inspired."

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:10%
This is where this started.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.487 align:middle line:10%
This is why they asked me
to do the contact modality

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:33.688 align:middle line:10%
article for the Free Book.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:10%
I'd written a book
called "Inspired," where

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.010 align:middle line:10%
I looked at
psychedelics, I looked

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:10%
at artists and musicians,
and all this kind of stuff.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:10%
And I came to this idea that
it was right brain, left brain,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:10%
that your left brain
is your ego mind.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And if you can shut
down your ego mind,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:10%
if you can shut off the
rational, analytical, little

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.270 align:middle line:10%
voice in your head, you
can pop into the field,

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.790 align:middle line:10%
and you can bring back
inventions and SONGS

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.560 align:middle line:10%
and that's how these
people were doing it.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.463 align:middle line:10%
And remember when I got
this, I went to Hal Puthoff,

00:14:01.463 --> 00:14:03.380 align:middle line:10%
because Hal Puthoff's
wife had discovered this

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.460 align:middle line:10%
as well, that all the remote
viewing people were doing stuff

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:10%
like, when they
did remote viewing,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:10%
they could tell you
what the texture was.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:10%
They could tell you
what the shape was.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:10%
They could tell you
what the color was.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.665 align:middle line:10%
But they couldn't tell you
what the name of it was.

00:14:16.665 --> 00:14:18.332 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't tell you the size.

00:14:18.332 --> 00:14:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And that's right
brain, left brain.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:10%
The image type stuff of
texture, of shape and stuff

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:10%
is all right brain.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:10%
And the size and the name
of it is all left brain.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:10%
The left brain is shut down.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:10%
That's how the remote
viewing is doing it.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:10%
They're doing it
with the right brain.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:10%
So I went to Hal Puthoff,
and I said to Hal,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:10%
I said I'd made this discovery.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:10%
All these contact modalities
are the same thing.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:10%
It's this right
brain, left brain.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.890 align:middle line:10%
If you can shut down the ego
mind, you can pop in there.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:10%
And I said, did you discover
that in the remote viewing?

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And he just simply-- he's very
short when he replies to you.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:10%
He just replied, read
chapter 6 in my book.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.850 align:middle line:10%
And his book is
called "Mind Reach."

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.550 align:middle line:10%
And in chapter 6, it's the in
one brain and out the other.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:10%
In the 1970s, they already
knew this right brain,

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:10%
left brain thing.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And so we started to
figure this thing out,

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:10%
that there is a
pattern to this thing.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And when I looked at the
70 contact modalities,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.580 align:middle line:10%
it was all the same thing.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.513 align:middle line:10%
It was identical.

00:15:05.513 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly the same thing.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:14.080 align:middle line:10%
I was absolutely floored that
it was so many similarities

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.257 align:middle line:10%
in exactly how it happens.

00:15:15.257 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, the question
is, how many brains?

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.560 align:middle line:10%
People will say, OK,
you've got your brains.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is quieting down.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.062 align:middle line:90%
And I say no.

00:15:23.062 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're making
these mistakes.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.010 align:middle line:84%
We're making these
false statements

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.600 align:middle line:90%
as to how things actually work.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
There are at least two brains.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.635 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:15:30.635 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:84%
There's right brain, left brain,
and they fight with each other.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.757 align:middle line:84%
When you cut the corpus
callosum between them,

00:15:34.757 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:90%
the two brains will fight.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.300 align:middle line:90%
They did lots of experiments.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.100 align:middle line:10%
They won the Nobel
Prize for this,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:10%
and we know there's two brains.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.120 align:middle line:10%
But Michael Gazzaniga,
who's now starting

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:10%
to get into out-of-body
and near-death experiences

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:10%
and out-of-body
experiences, and he

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:10%
was a real rational guy working
in the scientific world,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.660 align:middle line:10%
stated he's the head of
cognitive neuroscience.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:10%
He said the brain
is a confederation

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.800 align:middle line:10%
of independent modules
working together.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.207 align:middle line:10%
He said there are thousands
of modules in your brain.

00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:03.790 align:middle line:10%
So when you say, oh
my brain did this,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.215 align:middle line:10%
my brain did that, it's not.

00:16:05.215 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:10%
It's thousands of
different modules,

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.953 align:middle line:10%
all working independent but
together to create a thing.

00:16:10.953 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:10%
So they're working
like a beehive.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.578 align:middle line:10%
It's like a little socialist
colony inside your head.

00:16:14.578 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:10%
They're all doing the job
they're supposed to do.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.610 align:middle line:10%
They're all working
together for the one,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:10%
for the brain to
work it together.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:10%
So the brain is not one brain.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:10%
It's like thousands
of these sections that

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:10%
are all working together.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.778 align:middle line:10%
And you have to get these
things correct when you start.

00:16:29.778 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:10%
If you make the false assumption
that you just have one brain

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.695 align:middle line:10%
and the brain's doing this,
you're off on the wrong track

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.047 align:middle line:10%
to start with.

00:16:36.047 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:10%
This is significant.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:10%
It ties into the UFO phenomena.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:10%
This is the alien
and the scalpel,

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:10%
which was Roger Lear,
who did the implant--

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.900 align:middle line:10%
where he was pulling the
implants out of abductee people

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:10%
in California.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:10%
And I'll read what he says.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:10%
He was working
with Derrell Sims,

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:10%
who's doing alien implants.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.290 align:middle line:10%
"Following are
other factors that

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.790 align:middle line:10%
were found to be significant
in Derrell Sims study of 250

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.300 align:middle line:10%
alleged abduction cases.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:10%
All objects were obtained from
the left side of the bodies.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:10%
A significant number
of other cases

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:10%
have been investigated that
also show subjects, objects

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.780 align:middle line:10%
occurring in the left side
of the bodies of the alleged

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.130 align:middle line:10%
abductees."

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.500 align:middle line:10%
The left side of the body
is run by the right brain.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:10%
It's vice versa.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.770 align:middle line:10%
So the left side of the body
is run by the right brain.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.120 align:middle line:10%
So if 250 implant cases
are all in the left side

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.360 align:middle line:10%
of the body, that means whoever
is putting the implants in

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.230 align:middle line:10%
is not interested in your
rational, analytical ego mind.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.270 align:middle line:10%
It's interested in
your right brain.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:39.980 align:middle line:10%
And the right brain
is the female brain.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.620 align:middle line:10%
The right brain is the brain
that taps into the universe.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.120 align:middle line:10%
If you can shut
down the left brain,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:10%
if you can shut down what
Dolores Cannon used to call

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.820 align:middle line:10%
"Mr. Stupid."

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:10%
If you can shut
down the left brain,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:10%
the right brain will
tap into the universe

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:10%
and you see all the
contact modalities.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:10%
That's exactly how it works.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:10%
It's all one thing.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.270 align:middle line:10%
It's all dissociation.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:10%
You can dissociate
from your left brain,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:03.740 align:middle line:10%
you can tap into the field.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:10%
Dissociation and trauma.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.610 align:middle line:10%
So it's trauma forced
from the outside,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:10%
or you starting as meditating
as a little six-year-old kid,

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:10%
or all the Mission Rama people.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:10%
When I was talking to
Ricardo, and Enrique, and all

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.140 align:middle line:10%
these guys, you
talk to these guys,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:10%
and they say, oh, I started
meditating at 14 years old.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:10%
And you go, you're a boy
and you're meditating at 14?

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:10%
Like, come on.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.060 align:middle line:10%
No girls, no football?

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how many
boys meditate at 14?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And that's the whole thing is,
they're learning to dissociate.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:10%
Whereas a medium,
a lot of mediums,

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.450 align:middle line:10%
there's a big study done
on Brazilian mediums,

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.130 align:middle line:10%
have childhood abuse issues.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And what's happening is, you're
trying to cut off the world.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:10%
This terrible world
is around you,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.530 align:middle line:10%
and so you either
dissociate, where

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.455 align:middle line:10%
you become multiple
personalities

00:18:47.455 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:10%
and you have these
bizarre things

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.205 align:middle line:10%
with these multiple
personalities

00:18:50.205 --> 00:18:52.645 align:middle line:10%
to save the child,
or suddenly you're

00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:10%
talking to your
dead grandmother,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:10%
because you've dissociated.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:10%
You've cut off the ego mind.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.670 align:middle line:10%
It's so painful, you cut it off.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:10%
You dissociate.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.790 align:middle line:10%
All contact modalities,
I guarantee you,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:10%
are the same thing,
every single one of them.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:10%
So you even see with this
thing with these 250 implants,

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.140 align:middle line:10%
this very powerful
technical thing,

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:10%
it's all happening at
on the same side, which

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:10%
indicates that there's
something very significant going

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:10%
on there.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.255 align:middle line:10%
Now to me, it's like a radio.

00:19:20.255 --> 00:19:21.185 align:middle line:10%
And you've heard this.

00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:10%
We're starting more and
more in consciousness

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.477 align:middle line:10%
to talk about this, the fact
that the brain is just simply

00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:26.477 align:middle line:10%
a sender and a receiver.

00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:27.769 align:middle line:10%
It's not really doing anything.

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:10%
It's like the idiot in between.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And if you were to take to
Charles Darwin 150 years ago

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.335 align:middle line:10%
and take him a radio, a
battery operated radio

00:19:34.335 --> 00:19:35.960 align:middle line:10%
with the London
Philharmonic Orchestra,

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.867 align:middle line:10%
he'd say, oh,
there's an orchestra

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:10%
playing inside that radio.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And you'd say no, there's not.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:10%
No, no.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.942 align:middle line:10%
And he'd say, no, it's
there, I can see it.

00:19:43.942 --> 00:19:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And you could take
the back of the radio.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is what's happening
with this experiment that's

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.410 align:middle line:10%
being done now by Gary
Nolan, is what they've found

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:10%
is our brain center lights up.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:10%
And they say, oh, that's
where it's happening.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.060 align:middle line:10%
That's where the
psychic stuff is

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:10%
happening in that brain center.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:10%
And so if you were to go
back to Charles Darwin

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:10%
and show him the
back of the radio,

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:10%
take the back of
the radio off, he'd

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.950 align:middle line:10%
say look, see that vibrating,
that gray thing that's

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:06.320 align:middle line:10%
vibrating there, every time
that London Philharmonic

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.870 align:middle line:10%
Orchestra, that thing vibrates.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be inside.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.625 align:middle line:84%
The orchestra has got
to be inside the radio.

00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:12.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite clear.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.180 align:middle line:84%
There is no orchestra
inside the radio,

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
and there is no football
game inside the TV.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.000 align:middle line:10%
No matter how much you want
to say, it's not in the TV.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:10%
And yet science will keep
saying it's happening.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:10%
And this is where we've
gone off the track,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.345 align:middle line:10%
is to try to look at
certain brain sections.

00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:31.720 align:middle line:10%
Because the materialistic
world is trying to defend this.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:10%
They're trying to find out what
physical thing is happening

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:10%
to make you think
that you're having

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
an experience with a dead
person, or with an alien,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.063 align:middle line:10%
And to me, it's
like a light switch.

00:20:44.063 --> 00:20:45.980 align:middle line:10%
So whether you have a
channeler or whether you

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:10%
have a medium or whatever, it's
almost like a dimmer switch.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not an on/off switch.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
in or you're out.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.770 align:middle line:90%
It's like you're sort of in.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
better channelers.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Some people are better mediums.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It's how far can you
get into the field?

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.670 align:middle line:84%
How much can you shut down the
ego mind to get in the field?

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The more you can shut it down,
the more you can dissociate,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:90%
the better you are.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
information you need.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:10%
People will say, I don't
believe hypnosis material.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:10%
I say, so you actually believe
conscious rational people

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.450 align:middle line:10%
talking, that that's
accurate information?

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.575 align:middle line:10%
That is the most
inaccurate information

00:21:19.575 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:10%
you can possibly get.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.520 align:middle line:10%
The farther you can get
away from conscious,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:10%
where somebody has got
some religious view

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.660 align:middle line:10%
and some political view and
whatever, the farther you

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.160 align:middle line:10%
can get into that
field, the farther

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.285 align:middle line:10%
you can get away from the
rational analytical mind,

00:21:30.285 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:10%
the more accurate
the material will be.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:10%
And as you see with
experiments or with inventions,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:10%
this is where a lot
of inventions came.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.110 align:middle line:10%
That's my whole book "Inspired."

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:10%
I go through all
sorts of inventions.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:10%
You think people
invented this stuff?

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.680 align:middle line:10%
It popped out of the field.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:10%
It just popped into their head.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:10%
They were working on it,
and suddenly it was there.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.867 align:middle line:10%
They got into the field.

00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:10%
Everything's in the field.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.720 align:middle line:10%
It's all in the field.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.370 align:middle line:10%
You just think
you're in your head.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:10%
You just think you're
inside this little radio.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:10%
So Ingo Swann, who was one
of the top remote viewers,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.380 align:middle line:10%
the way he had it, he said
noise equates to inaccuracy.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.793 align:middle line:10%
And what the brain is
doing is creating noise.

00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I call it like the
bubble machine.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.710 align:middle line:90%
It's making this noise.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.327 align:middle line:84%
And when there's a noise,
you don't get any signal.

00:22:11.327 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:90%
The signal is there.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can get
the signal, but

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.970 align:middle line:84%
your rational, analytical ego
mind that is creating noise

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:20.502 align:middle line:90%
that's blocking the signal.

00:22:20.502 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you can rip
that filter, like they

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
said with the LSD experiments
Huxley talked about,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:90%
it's a filter.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:29.030 align:middle line:84%
If you could rip the
filter, and LSD did that,

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:90%
but it was like with a rocket.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.155 align:middle line:10%
It was an uncontrolled
ripping of the filter.

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:36.070 align:middle line:10%
And off he went into
this mystical world.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:10%
And with meditation, it's
a more controlled way

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:10%
of moving into the field.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:10%
But it's all the same thing.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:10%
It's all dissociation.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, this whole idea of
having a brain center,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.980 align:middle line:10%
I say it's false association.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:10%
So the analogy that I use
is, in Northern California

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.395 align:middle line:10%
there's a fire.

00:22:52.395 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:10%
And you look at
the fire, and you

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:10%
say there's 1,100
firefighters there.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And you say there's
a lot of smoke there,

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:02.990 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot of heat there.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.190 align:middle line:10%
But that doesn't mean that
the firefighters or the smoke

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.110 align:middle line:10%
or the heat caused the fire.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:10%
It's a false association.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:11.717 align:middle line:10%
Yes, the firefighters
are a part of the fire,

00:23:11.717 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't mean
that they're causing it.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:15.580 align:middle line:10%
So just because a
brain center lights

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.987 align:middle line:10%
up does not mean that that's
what's actually creating it.

00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:10%
Because what you'll
see when you start

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.947 align:middle line:10%
looking at neurology
of contact modalities,

00:23:21.947 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:10%
all the brain centers
are lighting up.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:10%
Or they're more
than lighting up.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:10%
What's happening, and I'll
show you as we go along,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:10%
they're shutting down.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:10%
That when you can shut down
certain brain centers, that's

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:10%
when suddenly the message comes.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.800 align:middle line:10%
Meditating monks are able to do
this, where they can shut down

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.000 align:middle line:10%
the parietal lobe,
and basically they

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.900 align:middle line:10%
go into this very high alpha.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's what's happening.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:10%
It's turning things off
rather than turning things on.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:10%
The more you can
turn off your brain,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.980 align:middle line:10%
the better the signal will
be, the less the noise,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.030 align:middle line:10%
and the more you can
get into that field

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and pull down material
which is real material.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.270 align:middle line:84%
The real reality of
the world is out there.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not in your head.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.040 align:middle line:10%
So this is this
false association

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.190 align:middle line:10%
with the firefighters.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as this was
shown at Laurentian University.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.160 align:middle line:90%
This is you sitting.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:10%
So when you're sitting,
you'll have all this action

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.930 align:middle line:10%
going on in your brain.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't mean that the
action going on in your brain

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.560 align:middle line:10%
is making you sit.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:10%
You decide to sit, and that
makes the action in your brain.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:10%
It's the observer who's
making the brain react.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.967 align:middle line:10%
It's not the brain that's
making the observer appear.

00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:10%
It's the other way around.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:10%
We have this
upside-down thinking

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:10%
and this way of doing it.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.080 align:middle line:10%
The same is now they're talking
about this Putamen thing.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:10%
And 10 years ago,
Kit Green was working

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:10%
on an experiment with the
guy at the Chinese Academy

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:10%
of Sciences, where they were
looking at this right side

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.920 align:middle line:10%
right parahippocampal gyrus.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:90%
And this thing was lighting up.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they were
saying that they

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.782 align:middle line:84%
wanted to run this experiment
and they were going

00:24:52.782 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:90%
to put Uri Geller in an MRI.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:10%
They're actually still proposing
due to this experiment,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:10%
where they're going to
put Uri Geller in an MRI,

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.710 align:middle line:10%
and they're going
to put this woman,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:01.750 align:middle line:10%
--her name is Cay Randall May--

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:middle line:10%
in another MRI.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:10%
And then Uri Geller is going
to send a signal to this woman.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.230 align:middle line:10%
And then what happens is,
they're going to have the MRI

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to see is
the signal instantaneous?

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Is consciousness
non-local, or does it

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:10%
take time for the signal to
go from one person to another?

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:10%
So 10 years ago, they were
working on this experiment

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:10%
with the Chinese.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.680 align:middle line:10%
And they were going to run
this experiment with this MRI

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:10%
machine.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.407 align:middle line:10%
And there they were
looking at this other part

00:25:26.407 --> 00:25:28.930 align:middle line:10%
of the brain that was lighting
up every time that Ingo

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.910 align:middle line:10%
Swann would get a target.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.830 align:middle line:10%
So they would give
him the target,

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:10%
and then when he hit the
target, this part of the brain

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:10%
would light up.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.410 align:middle line:10%
And that would indicate
to me that that's

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:10%
the part that's turning off and
allowing this sort of signal

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:10%
to come in and he picked it up.

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:48.970 align:middle line:10%
And if they didn't
get the target,

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:10%
then this left side
would light up,

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:10%
the interior frontal
gyrus would light up.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So actually, as I said, when
you look at these contact

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.390 align:middle line:84%
modalities, there's actually
a lot of neurology that's

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.570 align:middle line:90%
actually been done on this.

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:10%
They put a lot of
psychics, a lot of mediums,

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.907 align:middle line:10%
a lot of these people
into MRI machines,

00:26:03.907 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:10%
and they've started to
learn what's actually

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.600 align:middle line:10%
going on inside the brain.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.860 align:middle line:10%
This was this study.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.450 align:middle line:84%
This was this famous
study that was

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:84%
done on this telepathy
experiment, where

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.630 align:middle line:84%
the right parahippocampus
was lighting up.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what science
will say is, ah,

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
it's all just quantum
wave potentials.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I go like,
where do the quantum wave

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.210 align:middle line:90%
potentials come from?

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like
Terence McKinney

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:10%
used to talk about
that, the hard swallow,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.450 align:middle line:10%
the idea that
everything is random,

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:10%
and the idea that if you
give us all the quantum wave

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:10%
potentials, and you
give us all the mass

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.050 align:middle line:10%
and all the laws
of the universe,

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.585 align:middle line:10%
and you give us all that, that
one giant miracle to start

00:26:44.585 --> 00:26:46.460 align:middle line:10%
the whole thing off,
we'll explain it as just

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:10%
being a random universe.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.132 align:middle line:10%
But you've got to give us
that big miracle to start.

00:26:50.132 --> 00:26:51.840 align:middle line:10%
And they'll talk about
this all the time.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:10%
It's just a quantum--

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.930 align:middle line:10%
it's just a
holographic universe.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:10%
It's just quantum
wave potentials.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, well,
where does that come from?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.757 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's like you're
starting halfway down the road.

00:26:59.757 --> 00:27:01.340 align:middle line:84%
You're starting with
a physical thing.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.170 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, I've got to
start with the physical thing.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:10%
the same as they talk
about this other thing,

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.705 align:middle line:10%
with the quantum foam, that
the particles are coming

00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:10%
in out of the quantum foam.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, what?

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:11.880 align:middle line:10%
Wait, you just made up a word.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.922 align:middle line:10%
It's like you make up a
word and make it go away.

00:27:13.922 --> 00:27:15.260 align:middle line:10%
"Oh, it's just quantum foam."

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.520 align:middle line:10%
And this stuff's coming out.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see this
Cay Randall May,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:10%
who is being used by Kit
Green and these people.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:90%
She's an intuitive.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what she says
is, her vision--

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and Kit Green says
she's 95% accurate.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.743 align:middle line:10%
And what she says is that
the particles actually come,

00:27:35.743 --> 00:27:37.910 align:middle line:10%
the gravitons are coming
out of the fourth dimension

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.215 align:middle line:10%
through a membrane, through
holes in a membrane,

00:27:40.215 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:10%
and they come into
the third dimension,

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and all these
graviton form together

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.730 align:middle line:10%
into subatomic particles,
which create particles.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.178 align:middle line:10%
And that's how it
happens, and you

00:27:48.178 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:10%
have thousands of these
gravitons coming in

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.140 align:middle line:10%
through the fourth dimension.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.265 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, well, where
is this all coming from?

00:27:53.265 --> 00:27:55.250 align:middle line:10%
I mean, is that a random thing?

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.330 align:middle line:10%
Is that genetic mutation?

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how does this
suddenly accidentally happen,

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.060 align:middle line:10%
where all these particles
are all gathering together

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.490 align:middle line:10%
to create even one
simple hydrogen atom?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.550 align:middle line:10%
And if you're saying
it's happening randomly,

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.598 align:middle line:10%
that you rolled 12 billion
or 12 trillion double sixes,

00:28:11.598 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:10%
it only happens for one second.

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:15.860 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't mean the
hydrogen now stays forever

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:10%
and you can have hydrogen atoms.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:10%
You have to keep
rolling the dice.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:10%
In order to get that atom to
appear at one moment in time

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:10%
and space, you have to roll all
these dice for 13 billion years

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.180 align:middle line:10%
double sixes.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.347 align:middle line:10%
And that's only to keep it.

00:28:27.347 --> 00:28:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, when
does it go from being

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:10%
random to being pattern?

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And so the basic rule I
have, and this was a download

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:10%
that I got, a second
download I got,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.730 align:middle line:10%
was it's not a random world.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:38.960 align:middle line:10%
It's a self-organizing world.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And it's quite obvious when
you go back and look at it,

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.510 align:middle line:10%
it's self-organizing.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:10%
It's not a random
world where things

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.510 align:middle line:10%
are happening by
accident, but they

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:48.050 align:middle line:10%
will put these sort of things
where they'll put this out.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:10%
Deepak Chopra talks about this.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.430 align:middle line:10%
The Eastern religions
had this, and it's

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.740 align:middle line:10%
the Chid Akash, which
is the unlimited space

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.830 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.970 align:middle line:10%
So the basic premise I take,
and you see more and more people

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.410 align:middle line:10%
coming onto this
all the time, is

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:02.708 align:middle line:10%
that consciousness is
primary, that consciousness

00:29:02.708 --> 00:29:04.250 align:middle line:10%
is where everything
is coming out of,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:10%
the quantum wave, the
holographic universe, whatever,

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.050 align:middle line:10%
it's coming out of this
field of consciousness,

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.380 align:middle line:10%
this Chid Akash that is the
basis of the whole universe.

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.680 align:middle line:10%
And basically if you hear
the Eastern people say,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:10%
if it moves, it's illusion.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.270 align:middle line:10%
And so you have
this idea that you

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:10%
have people who have
these experiences,

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.960 align:middle line:10%
where they say it's
quiet and it's unlimited,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:10%
unconditional love.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:10%
It's quiet.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:29.660 align:middle line:10%
It's beautiful.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.452 align:middle line:10%
All this sort of stuff
when they're talking

00:29:31.452 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:10%
about being in the field.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Then you have, it's almost
like consciousness is quiet,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:38.635 align:middle line:10%
it's there, and somebody
throws a pebble into the water

00:29:38.635 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:10%
and the vibration starts,
and the physical universe

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.710 align:middle line:10%
starts to appear.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Because everything is frequency.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.390 align:middle line:10%
So when you've got
frequency, you have illusion,

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.600 align:middle line:10%
you have physical world.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:10%
But the only thing that's real
is that which is not moving.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:10%
The consciousness is the only
thing that's actually real.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.790 align:middle line:10%
So if it vibrates,
it's illusion.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
That which is real is
that which never changes,

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.290 align:middle line:90%
which is the observer thing.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just setting
up this background

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
as we get into the
consciousness modality.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So you have brain, the whole
idea in the modern world

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
is that brain creates
consciousness.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And I say it's the
other way around.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:17.960 align:middle line:84%
It's consciousness
creating the brain.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:19.127 align:middle line:90%
I have my little thing here.

00:30:19.127 --> 00:30:23.480 align:middle line:10%
I worked this thing, my
little brain toy here.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.950 align:middle line:10%
And basically there, you
can see how it works.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.130 align:middle line:10%
So you have this thing,
and it was actually

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:10%
trained with monks.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:10%
They actually trained on
this thing that I have.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.310 align:middle line:10%
And basically what
it is, is you're

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.930 align:middle line:10%
trying to get into theta.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.000 align:middle line:10%
So the question is,
who's making theta?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.370 align:middle line:10%
Is the brain making theta
and making the observer,

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:10%
or is the observer
telling the brain

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.310 align:middle line:10%
to meditate and make theta?

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.770 align:middle line:10%
And what happens
is, in this thing

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:49.500 align:middle line:10%
you have three different things.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.300 align:middle line:10%
So you have active.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:10%
So when this thing is on, and
I'm listening to this thing,

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.160 align:middle line:10%
if it's making a lot of rain,
I know I'm out of the zone.

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:01.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm up in a 20
Hertz or whatever.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.490 align:middle line:10%
And then you have to go.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.390 align:middle line:10%
And so the observer
says, oh, I got rain.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.760 align:middle line:10%
I got to go back,
concentrate on the breath,

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:13.280 align:middle line:10%
and then you quiet down, and you
get neutral, where it's quiet.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.560 align:middle line:10%
And you go, I'm getting
back into the zone.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And then you get into the
calm, where your brain becomes

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:10%
completely calm, and this thing
will actually make bird noises.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.605 align:middle line:84%
So then you know I'm in
the zone, I'm in the zone.

00:31:23.605 --> 00:31:25.522 align:middle line:84%
And then you get excited,
and all of a sudden,

00:31:25.522 --> 00:31:27.140 align:middle line:90%
whoop, the noise is back again.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that it's not
the brain that's doing this.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.705 align:middle line:10%
It's you making
the brain meditate,

00:31:32.705 --> 00:31:34.580 align:middle line:10%
and that's the whole
thing that people always

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.470 align:middle line:10%
forget is who's making
the brain meditate?

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Who's making the signals?

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.820 align:middle line:84%
There's an observer who's
telling the thing calm down,

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.080 align:middle line:90%
you're in the wrong zone.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.430 align:middle line:10%
And you're controlling it.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you've got
one of these toys,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.860 align:middle line:10%
you know this is how it works.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Because you can go,
I had 242 birds,

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:90%
and the next time I had one.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.422 align:middle line:10%
And it's I'm totally
out of the zone,

00:31:51.422 --> 00:31:53.150 align:middle line:10%
and how can I not
get back in the zone?

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.692 align:middle line:10%
And you're working
on it, you realize

00:31:54.692 --> 00:31:56.720 align:middle line:10%
it's an awful lot of work.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is the parietal lobe.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:10%
This was done at
University of Pennsylvania,

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.160 align:middle line:10%
and you'll see on
the right side,

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.790 align:middle line:10%
this is where they took the
monks and the people who

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:10%
were doing meditating, and they
did all this mystical stuff.

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's very active.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's red.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very active.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.722 align:middle line:84%
And when they do,
the meditation, you

00:32:13.722 --> 00:32:16.940 align:middle line:84%
see it quietens right down and
the oneness experience appears.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.070 align:middle line:10%
So the whole idea is,
when you can shut off

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:25.850 align:middle line:10%
the bubble machine, then the
oneness and the quiet appears.

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.310 align:middle line:10%
That's the real world when
you shut this thing down.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.500 align:middle line:10%
When the bubble machine is
going, and it's all red,

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.300 align:middle line:10%
and it's making
this noise, then you

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:10%
think that you are separate,
that you and I are separate

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.020 align:middle line:10%
and we're going to
fight with each other,

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.240 align:middle line:10%
and whoever has got the most
toys when they die wins,

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.930 align:middle line:10%
and you get that sort
of thing going on.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you can shut down
that part of the brain,

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.750 align:middle line:84%
and we now know how
to do it, we do this

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and we can run
experiments, and we

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.950 align:middle line:84%
can show how these different
things are shutting down

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and how these things appear.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.880 align:middle line:10%
Meditation is the biggest
contact modality there is.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And most people now know this.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.780 align:middle line:84%
They know that this is
very, very powerful stuff.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.290 align:middle line:10%
They brought Buddhist monks in.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And here you see
their brain pattern.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:10%
You see it on the
left side it's blue,

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:06.710 align:middle line:10%
which means it's down in
the 25 range or whatever.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And they take these
meditating monks

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.430 align:middle line:10%
who've been doing it for 30 or
40 years, and they're in gamma.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Gamma is very hard, even
to get it at gamma at 40.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:10%
And they're up at 100.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.620 align:middle line:10%
They're up at 80 to 100.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:10%
It's red.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.500 align:middle line:10%
It's completely lit up.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:10%
These people are completely
in gamma and the highest rates

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:29.298 align:middle line:10%
they'd ever seen
on the machines.

00:33:29.298 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:10%
And these monks were
able to do this.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.715 align:middle line:10%
And so you can see that
you can control this.

00:33:32.715 --> 00:33:34.550 align:middle line:10%
It's not a random brain
that's doing this.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.860 align:middle line:10%
It is the observer,
the monk, who

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.080 align:middle line:10%
is making that brain
pattern appear.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.715 align:middle line:10%
And so you can see
now we're starting

00:33:40.715 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:10%
to be able to control this.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Bashar, who is channeling
here tomorrow night,

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:48.040 align:middle line:84%
went under the MRI
machine, and they did his.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.900 align:middle line:10%
And on his, you can't really
see it very clear on here,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.565 align:middle line:10%
but you have the yellow,
which is very active.

00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in
his brain sections,

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
you see all these different
sections are shutting down.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.553 align:middle line:84%
So basically, the bubble
machine is shutting down.

00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:10%
As he's going into
this channeling session

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.450 align:middle line:10%
and making this contact, all
sorts of parts of the brain

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:10%
are shutting down.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.122 align:middle line:10%
And the same thing
happens in psychedelics,

00:34:08.122 --> 00:34:10.080 align:middle line:10%
where you think that
because this person seeing

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.750 align:middle line:10%
all these visions
and colors and stuff,

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.860 align:middle line:10%
you think the brain
is going crazy.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.159 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly the opposite.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:10%
The brain is quietening
down, and you're

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.000 align:middle line:10%
popping into that field,
where this stuff is there

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.762 align:middle line:10%
and that's the real reality.

00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:23.929 align:middle line:10%
We know with meditation
that you can actually change

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:25.167 align:middle line:10%
the structure of the brain.

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:27.500 align:middle line:84%
That was something that was
not even known 20 years ago,

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.107 align:middle line:84%
about the plasticity
of the brain,

00:34:29.107 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:90%
that the brain actually changes.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
change your brain.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.764 align:middle line:84%
You can actually change
the structure of your brain

00:34:33.764 --> 00:34:36.050 align:middle line:90%
and how your brain reacts.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Here's where you
get into this thing.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.569 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to skip over
this, because every knows this,

00:34:41.569 --> 00:34:46.460 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing about the
fact that the physical world is

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.929 align:middle line:90%
secondary to consciousness.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Amit Goswami said
"consciousness does matter.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.900 align:middle line:90%
Matter is secondary.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness is primary.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:90%
Brain does not do consciousness.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.893 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness does the brain."

00:34:59.893 --> 00:35:01.310 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
get that straight.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.420 align:middle line:84%
If you've got that
backwards, you're

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.795 align:middle line:84%
always going to go down this
materialistic road of trying

00:35:04.795 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to justify that there's
an illusion taking place

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and some physical part of the
brain is creating an illusion.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.880 align:middle line:84%
John Wheeler, who created black
holes and wormhole theory,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.580 align:middle line:84%
actually said "No phenomena is
a real phenomenon until it's

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:90%
an observed phenomena."

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the
observer is creating,

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.248 align:middle line:84%
you're manifesting a lot of the
stuff that's going around you.

00:35:23.248 --> 00:35:25.290 align:middle line:10%
And it all goes back to
the dual slit experiment,

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:10%
and I always say this, that
no matter what anybody wants

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:30.260 align:middle line:10%
to say, we always want
to go into the fact

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:10%
that the brain is created
or that consciousness

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:10%
is created by the brain.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.590 align:middle line:10%
And so we had this famous
dual slit experiment,

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.430 align:middle line:10%
where when the observer appears
the pattern on the back wall

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:10%
goes from a wave pattern
into a particle pattern.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:10%
The particles do not
appear on the back wall

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:46.650 align:middle line:10%
until there's an observer.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.200 align:middle line:10%
And as long as
there's no observer,

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.783 align:middle line:10%
there's no particles
on the back wall.

00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:51.950 align:middle line:10%
But the modern
scientific theory is

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.740 align:middle line:10%
that all these particles on the
back wall all gather together,

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.200 align:middle line:10%
and they created a brain, and
that created the observer.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.600 align:middle line:10%
And I say, no, the
observer was there first.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:10%
The observer is primary.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.320 align:middle line:10%
It is the observer that's
creating the physical world.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.203 align:middle line:10%
And so as many times as they've
tried to explain this the other

00:36:07.203 --> 00:36:09.370 align:middle line:10%
way around, that consciousness
is not a part of this

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:10%
experiment, they cannot make
consciousness disappear.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.050 align:middle line:10%
So in the quantum world,
in the scientific world,

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.890 align:middle line:10%
we're starting to realize that
the mystics and the people who

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.330 align:middle line:10%
have been on this
for a long time

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:22.222 align:middle line:10%
are actually going to be
right about this whole thing.

00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:23.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, even there's
some scientists--

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to show
one in a couple minutes,

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:26.890 align:middle line:10%
but there's even
a scientist that

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.308 align:middle line:10%
started this thing called a
Manifesto for Post-Materialist

00:36:29.308 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:10%
Science, and there's a bunch
of them that have actually

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.110 align:middle line:10%
gone on the record now.

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's Diane Hennacy
Powell was the one that I really

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:37.300 align:middle line:90%
know well.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And they basically have said,
no, consciousness is primary.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.020 align:middle line:84%
We've got to move to this
post-material world, where

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:84%
we start to look at things
as if there's something

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:47.890 align:middle line:90%
more than matter to the world.

00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a bunch of people
who have signed this paper.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So these are scientists,
high level scientists,

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.110 align:middle line:84%
who have actually
gone on the record

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and said, no, we think
that consciousness

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.970 align:middle line:84%
may be primary, that the
materialistic paradigm,

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that we're going off the track
by believing that everything

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:90%
is nuts and bolts.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Cay Randall May is this
girl, this intuitive

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:10%
that's being used
by this group that's

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:10%
working with experiencers,
Kit Green and Hal

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:12.850 align:middle line:10%
Puthoff and these people.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.220 align:middle line:10%
She said, "My brain
is only a receiver.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:10%
In the universe is
a core from which

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.750 align:middle line:10%
we obtain knowledge,
strength, and inspiration.

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.610 align:middle line:10%
I have not penetrated into
the secrets of this core,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.390 align:middle line:10%
but I know that it exists."

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's the one that
Kit Green describes her

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.430 align:middle line:10%
on one leaked tape as
being 95% accurate.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.912 align:middle line:10%
They're actually using her
to interact with the others.

00:37:34.912 --> 00:37:37.120 align:middle line:10%
They basically say, OK, who
are we dealing with here?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.880 align:middle line:10%
And she's an intuitive that
they're actually using.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.370 align:middle line:84%
John Wheeler said "it's a
participatory universe."

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Which means you as the
observer are participating

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.670 align:middle line:90%
in what's happening.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:48.280 align:middle line:10%
It's a participatory universe,
the idea that the observer is

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.390 align:middle line:10%
critically important.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Now we get into the
contact modalities.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.470 align:middle line:10%
I say and maintain,
once I saw them all,

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:10%
I put them all down on
paper, it's absolutely true.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:84%
All these contact modalities are
either dissociation or trauma.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.470 align:middle line:10%
So dissociation is
you doing meditation,

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.450 align:middle line:10%
you cutting off
the physical mind,

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.265 align:middle line:10%
and trauma is something
happens to you.

00:38:09.265 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:10%
You're in a car accident,
and suddenly you're

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.710 align:middle line:10%
out of your body and stuff
where the trauma happens to you.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:18.483 align:middle line:10%
And in all those cases, you
get this bizarre paranormal

00:38:18.483 --> 00:38:20.150 align:middle line:10%
phenomena that people
think is illusion.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:10%
It's actually the real world.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.377 align:middle line:10%
And so you get the gene
people who are saying,

00:38:24.377 --> 00:38:25.710 align:middle line:10%
no, it's happening in the brain.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.040 align:middle line:10%
There's this brain
section it's happening in.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.800 align:middle line:10%
It's like, no, all you've got
to do is look at the literature.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.063 align:middle line:10%
This guy is an acquired savant.

00:38:32.063 --> 00:38:33.730 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of these
acquired savants.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Acquired savants
are people who--

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:38.260 align:middle line:84%
this guy was hit with
a baseball in the head,

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.230 align:middle line:84%
and he suddenly started
to speak another language.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Or you get these
kind of things where

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:46.945 align:middle line:90%
there's a trauma that happens.

00:38:46.945 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:10%
So if you get hit in
the head with a baseball

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.530 align:middle line:10%
and you suddenly
start channeling,

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.110 align:middle line:10%
or you start talking to
dead people or something,

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.610 align:middle line:10%
that's got nothing
to do with genes.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.920 align:middle line:10%
That's got to do with
shutting off the left brain.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.470 align:middle line:10%
That's got to do with trauma
in the brain that shuts down

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.870 align:middle line:10%
a part of the brain that is
making the noise, the bubble

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:10%
machine.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.000 align:middle line:10%
And so you have this
guy had the trauma.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.080 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce, the famous Edgar
Cayce, when he first started,

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:10%
the famous story he told
was he had a schoolbook,

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:10%
and he couldn't memorize.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't get any of
the spelling words right.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And his father was
a very angry guy,

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and he was getting
angrier and angrier.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And then he suddenly hit
Edgar Cayce over the head,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and he went flying
off the chair,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.338 align:middle line:84%
and he was lying on
the floor, and that's

00:39:27.338 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
when the angel appeared
to him and said,

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Edgar, if you rest for a
minute, we will help you.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, daddy, daddy, let
me sleep on my spelling book,

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and I will know the spelling.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And he goes to sleep,
and a couple of minutes

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:84%
later, he comes back,
and it's at that point

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.440 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of his life
he can memorize everything

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.760 align:middle line:90%
that's in every book.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.630 align:middle line:10%
He just put it under
his head and sleep,

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.540 align:middle line:10%
and he could tell you
what's in the book.

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.790 align:middle line:10%
And he told his father every
single word in the book,

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:52.780 align:middle line:10%
how it was spelled.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.280 align:middle line:10%
And the second time
when he started

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:10%
doing the channeling thing,
where he was doing the body,

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:10%
we have the body,
and we should do this

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.860 align:middle line:10%
and we should do that,
he got hit in the head

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.780 align:middle line:10%
with a baseball.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:10%
This is trauma.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.680 align:middle line:10%
This is not genes.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.468 align:middle line:10%
This is shutting down
a part of the brain,

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.010 align:middle line:10%
and you see this
over and over again,

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:10%
this trauma thing
that causes people--

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.220 align:middle line:10%
I was just that up at the
ski resort last month,

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.360 align:middle line:10%
and the medium there at Big
Bear Lake, the medium guy,

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.288 align:middle line:10%
he's driving me back to LAX.

00:40:18.288 --> 00:40:20.080 align:middle line:10%
And he's talking about
I'm this medium guy,

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.270 align:middle line:10%
and I'm all this accurate
and this sort of stuff.

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.350 align:middle line:10%
And I went, Bob, you ever
have a near-death experience?

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no, never had
a near-death experience.

00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:31.033 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, oh,
there's something

00:40:31.033 --> 00:40:31.950 align:middle line:90%
wrong with the theory.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.533 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, you
know when it started?

00:40:33.533 --> 00:40:35.760 align:middle line:10%
I had this operation,
and it went really bad.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:10%
And it he starting telling
me, that was when suddenly I

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.177 align:middle line:10%
could talk to dead people.

00:40:41.177 --> 00:40:43.010 align:middle line:10%
And so it's this thing,
yeah, that's trauma.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:46.410 align:middle line:10%
I remember Sid and I, we
were in the bar in Toronto

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.727 align:middle line:10%
and that medium girl comes up.

00:40:47.727 --> 00:40:49.560 align:middle line:10%
And I'm telling Sid
this thing about trauma.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.770 align:middle line:10%
This was a couple of years ago.

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:10%
And I said, "Sid,
there's a trauma

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.303 align:middle line:10%
thing that people get
trauma, and they suddenly

00:40:54.303 --> 00:40:55.470 align:middle line:10%
become psychic or whatever."

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And he says, "no, no."

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:57.950 align:middle line:10%
And this girl Osee
comes up, and she's

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.120 align:middle line:10%
showing Sid some photographs.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.060 align:middle line:10%
And Sid's analyzing them
something else and whatever.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:10%
And then she says,
"I'm this medium,

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.685 align:middle line:10%
and I'm this and whatever."

00:41:05.685 --> 00:41:08.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Osee, can I ask
you a personal question?"

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.195 align:middle line:90%
And she says, "yeah, what?"

00:41:09.195 --> 00:41:10.237 align:middle line:90%
"How was your childhood?"

00:41:10.237 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, "oh,
it was terrible.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.530 align:middle line:90%
Sexual abuse, child abuse."

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.020 align:middle line:90%
And she goes on this whole rant.

00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And I go, "told you so."

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
looking at it,

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:84%
when you look at these
contact modalities,

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:20.880 align:middle line:90%
this is what's happening.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.338 align:middle line:84%
You get this sort of thing,
and people will say it's genes.

00:41:23.338 --> 00:41:24.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not genes.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.982 align:middle line:10%
This is a way to try to save
the materialistic paradigm.

00:41:26.982 --> 00:41:28.440 align:middle line:10%
When you start
looking at the data,

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.110 align:middle line:10%
you see all these other things.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.790 align:middle line:10%
Contact modalities, when
I gave my first lecture,

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:10%
I had my download
experience in 2012, 2013.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm at Florida, and
I'm giving a lecture,

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.190 align:middle line:10%
and Ray Hernandez from
Free has this experience

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:10%
where his dog gets healed.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.950 align:middle line:10%
And his wife is praying.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:90%
Praying is contact modality.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.120 align:middle line:84%
So he thinks it's
talking to aliens.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.653 align:middle line:10%
His wife said to
me-- we were there,

00:41:49.653 --> 00:41:51.570 align:middle line:10%
and she says, "tell Grant
about the UFO thing.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:53.558 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you guys, you talk
too much about UFOs."

00:41:53.558 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:10%
And she goes walking off.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.590 align:middle line:10%
She had no interest.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:10%
It's all Jesus.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:10%
It's God.

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.120 align:middle line:10%
So her thing was, she prayed
and this dog got healed.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.990 align:middle line:10%
And Ray sees it as
a UFO experience.

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.720 align:middle line:10%
But again, she's dissociating.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:10%
She's doing the praying thing.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.360 align:middle line:10%
So ray has this thing.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.685 align:middle line:10%
He comes, and he knows there's
a consciousness aspect.

00:42:10.685 --> 00:42:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And he goes on the
internet, and he finds out

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm into the consciousness
thing, so he contacts me.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.827 align:middle line:10%
And I say, "well, I'm
going to be in Florida."

00:42:16.827 --> 00:42:19.080 align:middle line:10%
I was lecturing from Paula
in Florida at Sebring.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:21.300 align:middle line:10%
And so Ray comes there,
and he tells his story

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.580 align:middle line:10%
with his wife in the
morning session there,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.710 align:middle line:10%
and he's never been
to a UFO conference.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:28.737 align:middle line:10%
And two days later, he's
on the Miami freeway,

00:42:28.737 --> 00:42:29.820 align:middle line:10%
and he's in a traffic jam.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, boom, he's
out of his body, and he's up,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.852 align:middle line:10%
and they're showing him--

00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:36.060 align:middle line:10%
And this is where he came
up with the idea of contact

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:10%
modalities.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:10%
He's in this field, and
they're showing him images.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.680 align:middle line:10%
So right brain is images.

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.160 align:middle line:10%
That's why the left brain--

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.480 align:middle line:10%
that's why a remote viewer can't
tell you the name of something,

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.043 align:middle line:10%
because it's left brain.

00:42:47.043 --> 00:42:48.960 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you say
to a remote viewer just

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.900 align:middle line:10%
see what you're seeing.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.150 align:middle line:10%
What you feel, what you
see, don't try to guess.

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.328 align:middle line:10%
Because once you try to guess,
you're letting the left brain.

00:42:57.328 --> 00:42:59.120 align:middle line:10%
The left brain says,
oh, I know what it is.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:10%
It's the King's Pyramid.

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.370 align:middle line:10%
It's the King's
Chamber in the pyramid.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:10%
And it starts guessing
and the whole session's

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.920 align:middle line:10%
over as soon as the
left brain takes over.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.510 align:middle line:10%
So he's there, and he's
seeing these images.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:08.468 align:middle line:10%
He's not getting words.

00:43:08.468 --> 00:43:09.680 align:middle line:10%
He's seeing these images.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.380 align:middle line:10%
And he's showing
you these images.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And what he's getting is UFO
contacts, spirits, ghosts,

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:16.650 align:middle line:10%
NDEs, remote
viewing, channeling,

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:10%
and all these images.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.477 align:middle line:10%
And this is wheel,
this wheel is turning,

00:43:19.477 --> 00:43:21.060 align:middle line:10%
and all these images
are on the wheel,

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and in the middle
is consciousness.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.970 align:middle line:10%
And then he gets the message--

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:10%
you are to put this message
out that all the contact

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.530 align:middle line:10%
modalities are the same thing.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.790 align:middle line:10%
They're all linked to
consciousness in the middle.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And so he describes it as true,
that we are parsing things.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.140 align:middle line:10%
Lots of times I'll
say to someone,

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.000 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm working
with this channeler.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:39.870 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be
talking to somebody

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.537 align:middle line:10%
who's an experiencer, who's been
on board the ship or something,

00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:44.660 align:middle line:10%
and they say, don't lump
in with those people.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.285 align:middle line:10%
Those people are all
a bunch of frauds.

00:43:46.285 --> 00:43:47.085 align:middle line:10%
I'm an experiencer.

00:43:47.085 --> 00:43:48.627 align:middle line:10%
Don't lump me in
with the channelers.

00:43:48.627 --> 00:43:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, no, it's
all the same thing.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:52.420 align:middle line:84%
There may be good channelers
and bad channelers,

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:54.040 align:middle line:90%
but it's all the same modality.

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all lined in.

00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's this wheel.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.110 align:middle line:10%
So he got this vision
a couple of days

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.820 align:middle line:10%
after seeing my
consciousness lecture,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.750 align:middle line:10%
and that's where this thing--
so he asked me to do it,

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.120 align:middle line:10%
and I was having
a hard time what

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:10%
I was going to do
with the articles,

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:10%
and I said I'll
write them all down.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I came
up with this huge number.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:07.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, meditation is the big one.

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.723 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to spend
too much, but there's

00:44:09.723 --> 00:44:11.790 align:middle line:10%
been a lot of EEG stuff
done on meditation.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.190 align:middle line:10%
Meditation is just
basic dissociating.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:15.840 align:middle line:10%
It's quieting the mind.

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.580 align:middle line:10%
It's making the little Mr.
Stupid go to sleep or whatever.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.890 align:middle line:10%
And then you go into
the field, and the more

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:26.005 align:middle line:10%
you can go into the field,
the more practice you have,

00:44:26.005 --> 00:44:27.630 align:middle line:10%
the farther you can
get into the field.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.970 align:middle line:10%
And there's been all
sorts of MRI work done

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:31.740 align:middle line:10%
on this kind of stuff.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.930 align:middle line:10%
If you've seen the
latest book called

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.870 align:middle line:10%
"American Cosmic"
written by Diane Pasulka,

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.658 align:middle line:10%
there's a guy there, she calls
him Tyler D. He's been exposed.

00:44:40.658 --> 00:44:41.700 align:middle line:90%
His name is actually Tim.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.800 align:middle line:84%
I actually had some
contact with this guy.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Very, very interesting
guy, really nice guy.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.850 align:middle line:10%
And he's got a technique.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.140 align:middle line:10%
I remember him telling me.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.688 align:middle line:10%
I had a conversation with
him in 2013, and because I'd

00:44:52.688 --> 00:44:54.230 align:middle line:10%
had the download
experience, and he'd

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.600 align:middle line:10%
had the download experience.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.770 align:middle line:10%
Here's a guy who sold a
company for huge money.

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:02.220 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking to
me about his experience.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:10%
He said to me-- and he
talks about it in the book,

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.113 align:middle line:10%
where this general, he has this
idea that comes in his head.

00:45:08.113 --> 00:45:09.780 align:middle line:10%
And this general says,
we need something

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.280 align:middle line:10%
to put on the space shuttle.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.900 align:middle line:10%
And he says, I got this idea.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:14.580 align:middle line:10%
And the general says, "garbage.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:10%
That ain't gonna work.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.220 align:middle line:10%
We're not putting that
on the space shuttle.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:10%
No way."

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.503 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "no, I
think it'll work."

00:45:18.503 --> 00:45:20.940 align:middle line:10%
And he gets a scientist
to sign off on this thing.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.212 align:middle line:10%
And they put it on the
space shuttle, and it works.

00:45:23.212 --> 00:45:24.833 align:middle line:10%
>> What is it?

00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:25.750 align:middle line:10%
>> You'll have to see.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.280 align:middle line:10%
It was described
differently to me.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:10%
To me it was described as having
something to do with putting--

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.490 align:middle line:10%
allowing human tissue
to bind to metal.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:35.050 align:middle line:10%
But she describes
it differently.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.370 align:middle line:10%
She describes the
experience differently.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.787 align:middle line:10%
The way he told
me the experience,

00:45:37.787 --> 00:45:40.000 align:middle line:10%
he said, "you know, Grant--"

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.490 align:middle line:10%
And he sold this thing,
and he's got 40 patents.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And he claims he's
getting them from the ETs.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:45.250 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:10%
He said they're benign.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:48.310 align:middle line:10%
They're here to help us,
and he is getting this.

00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And he's got his own modality
that he uses for this.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.370 align:middle line:10%
But he said to me--

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:55.570 align:middle line:10%
because we were talking,
because I had the download

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.445 align:middle line:10%
experience as well, and
he was talking to me.

00:45:57.445 --> 00:45:59.140 align:middle line:10%
He said, "I'll tell
you what, Grant."

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.520 align:middle line:10%
He said, "I woke up with
that idea that one morning.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.500 align:middle line:84%
I woke up with that
idea in my head."

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.762 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "the last
thing I remember the night

00:46:06.762 --> 00:46:08.220 align:middle line:84%
before was a hooded
figure standing

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the bed."

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.440 align:middle line:90%
And I went, "hooded figure?

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Could you see its face?"

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.570 align:middle line:10%
He went, "no, I
couldn't see its face."

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:13.830 align:middle line:10%
You can never see the face.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:15.913 align:middle line:10%
In the Free survey, there's
over 400 people who've

00:46:15.913 --> 00:46:18.965 align:middle line:10%
seen the cloaked, the
monked person or whatever,

00:46:18.965 --> 00:46:20.340 align:middle line:10%
and nobody can
ever see the face.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.387 align:middle line:10%
So I said, "you
should be regressed.

00:46:22.387 --> 00:46:23.220 align:middle line:10%
I know Yvonne Smith.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:25.290 align:middle line:10%
You go to LA all the time, you
should go to the Yvonne Smith.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Yvone Smith should regress you.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.450 align:middle line:10%
You should find out what
happened in that thing."

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.150 align:middle line:10%
And now he's got
an actual technique

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:10%
that he uses to tap into this.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:33.840 align:middle line:10%
He gets eight hours sleep.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.390 align:middle line:10%
He gets up, and then goes
back to sleep for one hour.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.160 align:middle line:10%
He goes into the sun.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.780 align:middle line:10%
He drinks large
amounts of water.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.030 align:middle line:10%
He never touches
alcohol or coffee.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:44.923 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that the DNA
is the sender and receiver.

00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:46.090 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking earlier.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.660 align:middle line:10%
We were trying to do some
DNA experiments to actually

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.650 align:middle line:10%
totally destroy the
whole idea of DNA,

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:10%
what people think DNA is.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:55.997 align:middle line:10%
And so he says that the DNA is
actually a sender and receiver.

00:46:55.997 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:10%
He's fascinated with this thing.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:02.100 align:middle line:10%
And he says if you look, he says
NASA, all the antennas in NASA

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.810 align:middle line:10%
are built upon DNA.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:04.780 align:middle line:10%
And I had a photograph.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.060 align:middle line:10%
I should have put it in here.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.520 align:middle line:10%
A guy showed the antenna
that's used to communicate

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.410 align:middle line:10%
with the space station.

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:12.750 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a DNA molecule.

00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.520 align:middle line:10%
It's this spiral antenna.

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.720 align:middle line:10%
And he said they know this.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.800 align:middle line:10%
It's the prime thing.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.240 align:middle line:10%
It's 150.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:20.490 align:middle line:10%
The DNA is 150 megahertz.

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:23.970 align:middle line:10%
It's the same signal that's used
for deep space communication.

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:24.990 align:middle line:10%
So we know this stuff.

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.447 align:middle line:10%
And this is behind the scenes.

00:47:26.447 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:10%
So this guy's not really public.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.130 align:middle line:10%
They know this stuff
behind the scenes,

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.630 align:middle line:10%
that there's this connection,
there's these sorts of things.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:10%
But he has his own
technique that he uses.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.820 align:middle line:10%
And it's the Tyler Technique.

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.350 align:middle line:10%
And when did it happen?

00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:40.830 align:middle line:10%
It happens-- he's
friends with Judy Resnik.

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:43.140 align:middle line:10%
And she goes on
the space shuttle,

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:45.340 align:middle line:10%
and he watches her die.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And he's devastated.

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:90%
He absolutely loses it.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And he gets divorced.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.480 align:middle line:90%
He has heart palpitations.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And boom, suddenly
he has the vision.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Suddenly, he taps in.

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:58.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's this whole
thing about trauma, as bad

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:10%
as it is, it has the other
side, that it pops you

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.130 align:middle line:10%
into this field.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's when he started
having these psychic visions.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.910 align:middle line:10%
And he's got 40 patents.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.207 align:middle line:10%
And he had the one, the
main one, he put it out,

00:48:08.207 --> 00:48:10.290 align:middle line:10%
and he put it on the space
shuttle, and it worked.

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And it came back, and
they told him and said,

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:10%
you've got to go to Washington.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And he tells it.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.460 align:middle line:10%
Diane Pasulka tells
this story in the book.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.320 align:middle line:10%
He goes to Washington,
he says, oh, I'm

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.730 align:middle line:10%
going to get an award for this.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.620 align:middle line:10%
He gets called to the
basement of a building,

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.270 align:middle line:10%
and this two star
general comes walking

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.660 align:middle line:10%
and he said, "who the hell
came up with that invention?"

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.180 align:middle line:10%
And the scientist who signed
off on it points at him

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:10%
and he said, "he did."

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.700 align:middle line:10%
And he realized suddenly, "I'm
not getting an award here."

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.970 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "where
did you get that from?"

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:41.653 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "oh, it was just a
thing that came into my head."

00:48:41.653 --> 00:48:42.570 align:middle line:10%
He called it a memory.

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:43.820 align:middle line:10%
That's the way Diane Pasulka--

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.650 align:middle line:10%
the way he told me, there was
a being at the end of the bed

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:47.580 align:middle line:10%
before it happened.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.230 align:middle line:10%
But he said, "it
was just a memory."

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:51.052 align:middle line:84%
And he said the guy
thought I was an idiot

00:48:51.052 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:90%
and threw me out of the room.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:90%
But this is a thing.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.642 align:middle line:10%
A two star general
picked up on this,

00:48:54.642 --> 00:48:56.310 align:middle line:10%
that where did
you get this from?

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.580 align:middle line:10%
And it came out of the field.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.120 align:middle line:10%
He had dissociated,
and he picked this up.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.040 align:middle line:10%
So you can see that
high level government

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.615 align:middle line:10%
people are using this method.

00:49:03.615 --> 00:49:04.490 align:middle line:10%
They know about this.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.660 align:middle line:10%
This is not something
that they're not--

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.450 align:middle line:10%
Hypnosis is this thing, where
people are against hypnosis.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And I argue with a
Free neurologist guy.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:16.400 align:middle line:10%
And I said, you can't be using--

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.960 align:middle line:10%
they always say they're going
to use just ordinary stuff

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.320 align:middle line:10%
from the ordinary memories.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.980 align:middle line:10%
I said, that's the
worst you could use.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:24.840 align:middle line:10%
The farther you get away from
that, the better the material

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:25.290 align:middle line:10%
is going to be.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:10%
That's the worse
material you can use.

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's totally biased.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And stuff like that, you
can lead people in hypnosis,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.490 align:middle line:84%
but you can sure lead people in
their conscious life as well.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:35.203 align:middle line:10%
So hypnosis, we
know that there's

00:49:35.203 --> 00:49:37.620 align:middle line:10%
all these studies done that
the ESP is very high, that you

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.345 align:middle line:10%
can do the higher ESP.

00:49:39.345 --> 00:49:40.470 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole thing.

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
You're tapping into the field.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Dolores Cannon does
with her QQHT thing.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:49.175 align:middle line:84%
John Burroughs talks about when
he was doing his regression,

00:49:49.175 --> 00:49:51.300 align:middle line:84%
he started this channeling
thing in the regression.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.895 align:middle line:90%
He started to talk about this.

00:49:52.895 --> 00:49:54.270 align:middle line:84%
So you see these
kinds of things,

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.410 align:middle line:84%
that in hypnosis your left
brain is quiet and down,

00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.700 align:middle line:90%
and things start to happen.

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.980 align:middle line:84%
You start popping
into the field.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Cay Randall May,
this woman that's

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:84%
being used by the
to the stars people,

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.610 align:middle line:84%
she calls her inner vision
process that she uses.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.970 align:middle line:90%
And here's an interesting one.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.960 align:middle line:90%
You have John Burroughs.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me go to the next
slide and come back.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:25.042 align:middle line:84%
OK, so John Burroughs,
they wanted his DNA.

00:50:25.042 --> 00:50:27.500 align:middle line:10%
John Burroughs is the famous
guy from the Rendlesham Forest

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.300 align:middle line:10%
case.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.180 align:middle line:10%
They want his DNA.

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.800 align:middle line:10%
So he finally agrees, because
they get him disability.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:35.300 align:middle line:10%
Kit Green, who's formerly from
the CIA, gets him disability.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.050 align:middle line:10%
So he says, OK, I'll
give you my DNA.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:39.675 align:middle line:10%
So they come back with the DNA,
and they say it's all American.

00:50:39.675 --> 00:50:41.940 align:middle line:10%
Your son doesn't have
any traces on anything.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And then they tell him to
do this yoga, whatever type

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.165 align:middle line:10%
of yoga, and meditation.

00:50:50.165 --> 00:50:52.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is interesting,
because this has actually

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.957 align:middle line:10%
been done at University
of Pennsylvania.

00:50:53.957 --> 00:50:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And what they do is, they
have this hyper arousal state,

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:02.280 align:middle line:10%
where what you do is, you
take an action and a rest.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:05.310 align:middle line:10%
So you do yoga and
meditation at the same time.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.190 align:middle line:84%
You do drumming, slow
drumming, and dancing.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.930 align:middle line:84%
You're doing both
at the same time.

00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And what they say at the
University of Pennsylvania

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.660 align:middle line:84%
is, what you do is you overload
the temporal and parietal

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.620 align:middle line:90%
lobes.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.140 align:middle line:10%
It's waiting for a signal,
and it overloads the system,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.380 align:middle line:10%
and they shut down.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:23.080 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly there's no
time, there's no space.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And so this is the whole idea.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.040 align:middle line:10%
And it was interesting
how Kit Green

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:30.510 align:middle line:10%
tells him to do these two things
at the same time, the yoga

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.267 align:middle line:10%
and the meditation type thing.

00:51:34.267 --> 00:51:36.600 align:middle line:10%
So you can see again that
they may have some idea of how

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.438 align:middle line:10%
this stuff works.

00:51:38.438 --> 00:51:39.480 align:middle line:10%
How much time have I got?

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:40.355 align:middle line:10%
Oh, I got 30 minutes.

00:51:40.355 --> 00:51:41.410 align:middle line:10%
Good.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.250 align:middle line:10%
So the yoga, we have
a lot of yoga people

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.360 align:middle line:10%
will describe the fact that you
have telepathy, clairvoyance.

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.410 align:middle line:10%
And it's the physical
part of meditation.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:53.580 align:middle line:10%
So prayer, as I said with
Ray Hernandez's wife,

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.510 align:middle line:10%
she prays all night.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.560 align:middle line:10%
And to her, she's had
lots of experiences,

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.140 align:middle line:10%
like beings, ships with
stained glass windows

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.020 align:middle line:10%
and stuff like that, and
started this huge organization.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:10%
It was her that actually started
this thing, got Ray going on it

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.980 align:middle line:10%
and this sort of stuff.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.657 align:middle line:10%
And to her, it's all prayer.

00:52:10.657 --> 00:52:12.490 align:middle line:10%
So she's just using a
different word for it.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:13.410 align:middle line:10%
She's disassociating.

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:15.160 align:middle line:10%
She's praying, praying,
praying all night,

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.990 align:middle line:10%
and suddenly this 15-year-old
dog who is totally paralyzed

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.490 align:middle line:10%
is suddenly like a brand new
puppy, and it's running around,

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:21.720 align:middle line:10%
and it's cured.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Ray sees it as a UFO experience.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.090 align:middle line:90%
She says it's just Jesus.

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:25.890 align:middle line:90%
It's God.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And she even said
to me, she says,

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.810 align:middle line:84%
"well, do you think
it's really God?"

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:32.176 align:middle line:90%
I said, "well, whatever.

00:52:32.176 --> 00:52:34.453 align:middle line:10%
Whoever is doing
this, God's in charge.

00:52:34.453 --> 00:52:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Don't worry about it."

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:36.745 align:middle line:10%
She said, "thank
you, thank you."

00:52:36.745 --> 00:52:38.920 align:middle line:10%
She goes walking off.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.570 align:middle line:10%
So there's Ray Hernandez.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:42.370 align:middle line:10%
Hypnagogic.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:43.495 align:middle line:10%
This is an interesting one.

00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:47.380 align:middle line:10%
People have this thing, and
I get it when I wake up,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.863 align:middle line:10%
where I wake up or in the middle
of night, where I can't sleep.

00:52:50.863 --> 00:52:53.030 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly I realize
I'm not really sleeping,

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:54.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm not really awake.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:58.400 align:middle line:10%
And I can actually put things
into my head and run things.

00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.870 align:middle line:10%
And it's clear as day.

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.490 align:middle line:10%
And you know that
when that happens,

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.115 align:middle line:10%
you've got to get up
and write it down.

00:53:03.115 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Because if you don't write
it down, or you write it down

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.875 align:middle line:10%
and then you read
it the morning,

00:53:06.875 --> 00:53:10.593 align:middle line:10%
you go "what the
hell was I writing?"

00:53:10.593 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:10%
Because you think, "oh, I'm
going to remember this."

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And this is the interesting one.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:18.140 align:middle line:84%
So the hypnagogic state is when
you're going to go to sleep.

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:22.980 align:middle line:10%
So the most famous one was--

00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm forgetting his name.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.580 align:middle line:90%


00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:28.080 align:middle line:90%
The big inventor, Edison.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Edison always claimed
that he didn't sleep.

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:32.730 align:middle line:10%
He only slept two hours
a night or whatever.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.770 align:middle line:10%
And he would meditate
in his studio.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:37.020 align:middle line:10%
But he was actually
falling asleep in his lab.

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.210 align:middle line:10%
So what he'd say, and
there's actually a statue--

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:40.502 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you can see it.

00:53:40.502 --> 00:53:42.580 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's the next slide.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Next slide.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:45.670 align:middle line:10%
OK, here.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:46.960 align:middle line:10%
There's actually a statue.

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And in the statue, you'll
see that in his left hand

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:51.900 align:middle line:90%
he's got a steel ball.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.250 align:middle line:84%
The story behind the
steel ball is this.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.540 align:middle line:10%
He wouldn't sleep at night.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:56.800 align:middle line:10%
He'd go into his lab.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And here's a guy at
2,500 inventions.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:01.220 align:middle line:10%
3,000 pages of notes.

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:02.650 align:middle line:10%
He would sit in his chair.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:04.730 align:middle line:10%
He'd put a steel
ball on the floor.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.330 align:middle line:10%
He'd put the steel ball in his
hand, and he would sit there,

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:08.620 align:middle line:10%
and he would meditate.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.283 align:middle line:10%
And of course, he'd fall asleep.

00:54:10.283 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as he would fall
asleep, his hand would relax.

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:15.280 align:middle line:10%
The steel ball would fall into
the plate and wake him up,

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.655 align:middle line:10%
and he would immediately write
down what was in his head.

00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:21.490 align:middle line:10%
He had 3,000 pages, 3,000
books full of material

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.450 align:middle line:10%
that he had gotten.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.250 align:middle line:10%
And that's why when
they built the statue,

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:25.750 align:middle line:10%
they put the steel
ball in his hand.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:10%
That's how he got
his inventions.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.130 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing.

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:29.020 align:middle line:10%
It's disassociating.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:10%
It's that period just
before you go to sleep,

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:34.150 align:middle line:10%
where if you get an image
or you get something,

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.200 align:middle line:10%
you're out of the field.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.640 align:middle line:10%
Your left brain
is shutting down.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.690 align:middle line:10%
It's moving away.

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:39.805 align:middle line:10%
You're moving into the field.

00:54:39.805 --> 00:54:41.180 align:middle line:10%
And when you get
into the dreams,

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.860 align:middle line:10%
then you're right
into the field.

00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:44.980 align:middle line:10%
And that's why in your
dreams you see images.

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:47.943 align:middle line:10%
You see symbols
rather than words.

00:54:47.943 --> 00:54:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Because you're in
the right brain.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.068 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing symbols
and you're supposed

00:54:51.068 --> 00:54:52.730 align:middle line:10%
to put the symbols together.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:53.530 align:middle line:10%
So here's the one.

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:56.500 align:middle line:10%
I've had a few of these,
the ones in the morning.

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.460 align:middle line:84%
"Frankenstein," the story
"Frankenstein." came.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Gary Nolan, the famous
guy from To the Stars,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.340 align:middle line:90%
describes this quite clearly.

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.020 align:middle line:10%
He said, I go at night, and
I put all my stuff together,

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.100 align:middle line:10%
And I put all the problems,
and I put it there.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.682 align:middle line:10%
And then I say I
need to solve this.

00:55:11.682 --> 00:55:13.390 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I'll wake
up in the morning,

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:14.807 align:middle line:10%
and the answer's
in my head, or it

00:55:14.807 --> 00:55:16.190 align:middle line:10%
comes within a couple of days.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:18.130 align:middle line:10%
So I had this woman,
the one with the cat

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:19.480 align:middle line:10%
with the orb in the corner.

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:23.463 align:middle line:10%
And she said, "I've
got this problem."

00:55:23.463 --> 00:55:24.880 align:middle line:10%
She said, "I wanted
to know this."

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.270 align:middle line:10%
I said, "well, what you do is,
you take a couple of questions

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:10%
you want, and you put
them beside the bed.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:32.420 align:middle line:10%
And you say to yourself,
I want these answers,

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:33.310 align:middle line:10%
I want this now."

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.940 align:middle line:10%
Because people use this.

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:36.180 align:middle line:10%
She phones me the next day.

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:10%
She says, "I've got to
tell you this story.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:38.890 align:middle line:10%
She tells me this
bizarre story about this

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.765 align:middle line:10%
being in the room and
all that sort of stuff.

00:55:40.765 --> 00:55:41.677 align:middle line:10%
And this does work.

00:55:41.677 --> 00:55:42.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is the thing.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:48.590 align:middle line:10%
It's you give the instruction to
your right brain to the field.

00:55:48.590 --> 00:55:52.298 align:middle line:10%
And when your left brain shuts
down, it will go in there.

00:55:52.298 --> 00:55:53.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's what happened to me.

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:56.410 align:middle line:10%
And my experience happened
watching Colin Andrews.

00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:58.240 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't want to
be in the lecture.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't interested
in crop circles.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:05.380 align:middle line:10%
And he was yakking away, and I'm
zoning out, and I dissociated.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:07.480 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, boom,
it was instantaneous,

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.980 align:middle line:10%
and it came with
absolute certainty,

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.900 align:middle line:10%
which people describe.

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:10.720 align:middle line:10%
It was like boom, boom, boom.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.110 align:middle line:10%
There it is.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:12.818 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, oh,
that's how it works.

00:56:12.818 --> 00:56:15.397 align:middle line:10%
And it was like walking around
for two days, just couldn't

00:56:15.397 --> 00:56:16.480 align:middle line:10%
believe what had happened.

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.312 align:middle line:10%
So these are some of
the contact modalities.

00:56:19.312 --> 00:56:22.470 align:middle line:90%


00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:23.270 align:middle line:90%
"Little elves."

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:25.515 align:middle line:84%
That's what Gary
Nolan calls them.

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:27.890 align:middle line:84%
He calls them the little elves
that do the work at night.

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:30.057 align:middle line:84%
The Ganzfeld experiment,
I'm going to get into this.

00:56:30.057 --> 00:56:33.860 align:middle line:10%
They use this, where
you create white noise,

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.110 align:middle line:10%
and you put the ping
pong balls over the ice.

00:56:36.110 --> 00:56:39.830 align:middle line:10%
They've done ESP
experiments like that.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:43.830 align:middle line:84%
My biggest one, my biggest
download experience I had,

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:44.630 align:middle line:90%
was walking.

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:46.010 align:middle line:90%
I walk tremendous amounts.

00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll walk like five, six miles.

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.530 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't matter
how cold it is, whatever.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's like a walking
meditation, where suddenly it's

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:55.270 align:middle line:10%
like--

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:58.130 align:middle line:10%
and I remember when the big
one came about two years ago.

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:00.200 align:middle line:10%
And eventually I'll
write a book on it.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.858 align:middle line:10%
When it started to come, I knew.

00:57:01.858 --> 00:57:02.900 align:middle line:10%
Because you can sense it.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.192 align:middle line:10%
Gary Nolan says the same thing.

00:57:04.192 --> 00:57:07.125 align:middle line:10%
People who are inventors
who get this, they know.

00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:08.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like this sense.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.080 align:middle line:10%
They know this is real.

00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.400 align:middle line:10%
You've got to write this down.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.240 align:middle line:10%
And so it was cold.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:10%
I took my glove off, and
I'm writing, and walking,

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:14.883 align:middle line:10%
and I'm putting this stuff down.

00:57:14.883 --> 00:57:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And then it stops.

00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And then I go walk.

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And I was like,
here it comes again.

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.988 align:middle line:10%
And I get the glove off,
and I'm writing again.

00:57:19.988 --> 00:57:21.770 align:middle line:10%
And it comes with this
absolute certainty.

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:23.210 align:middle line:10%
And when you start
looking at it,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:26.300 align:middle line:10%
then you realize that it
was way ahead of the game,

00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.250 align:middle line:10%
that it's basically
giving you this.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.650 align:middle line:10%
It's popping into the field.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:32.090 align:middle line:10%
How do you pop into the field?

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:10%
There are different
ways, and you've

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.370 align:middle line:10%
got to figure out which
way you can do it.

00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:35.995 align:middle line:10%
Daydreaming, that's
what happened to me

00:57:35.995 --> 00:57:37.102 align:middle line:10%
with my experience.

00:57:37.102 --> 00:57:38.060 align:middle line:10%
Here's the daydreaming.

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:40.340 align:middle line:10%
You may not know, it
in my "Inspired" book

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.250 align:middle line:10%
I go through 13 Nobel prizes.

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:46.700 align:middle line:10%
Two of them, one was the laser,
and one was the hologram.

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.920 align:middle line:10%
Both of them were
on park benches.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.300 align:middle line:10%
And this one with Towns,
who invented the laser,

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:54.980 align:middle line:10%
that actually turned
the park bench

00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:58.027 align:middle line:10%
into a statue, a famous
statue here in California.

00:57:58.027 --> 00:57:59.360 align:middle line:10%
That's why he got the invention.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.277 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is, you
put all the material in.

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:04.070 align:middle line:10%
You do all the work, you
put all the information in,

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:05.405 align:middle line:10%
and then you quiet the mind.

00:58:05.405 --> 00:58:06.530 align:middle line:10%
So he put all the material.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.230 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't figure it out.

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:08.180 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't figure it out.

00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:09.100 align:middle line:10%
He goes for a walk.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.840 align:middle line:10%
He sits on the park bench,
and all of a sudden, boom.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:12.890 align:middle line:90%
It's putting it together.

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:14.600 align:middle line:90%
And you have to quiet the mind.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.590 align:middle line:10%
The other one with
the hologram, he

00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:19.950 align:middle line:10%
was watching people play tennis.

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:20.750 align:middle line:10%
Same thing.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:22.585 align:middle line:10%
Left the lab distressed.

00:58:22.585 --> 00:58:23.960 align:middle line:10%
Couldn't figure
it out, whatever.

00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And he's sitting there
watching people play tennis,

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.353 align:middle line:10%
and all of a sudden,
boom, it just happened.

00:58:27.353 --> 00:58:28.260 align:middle line:10%
Came into his head.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:29.927 align:middle line:10%
And everybody describes
it the same way.

00:58:29.927 --> 00:58:32.182 align:middle line:10%
Instantaneous,
absolute certainty.

00:58:32.182 --> 00:58:33.140 align:middle line:10%
You know this is right.

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:34.670 align:middle line:10%
This is not just any idea.

00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:35.750 align:middle line:10%
This is how it works.

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:37.290 align:middle line:10%
You run back to
the lab, you do it,

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.700 align:middle line:10%
and it works, and it's given
it's basically given to you.

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:42.350 align:middle line:10%
Trance channeling,
we're trying to do

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:44.990 align:middle line:10%
this experiment, which I think
will revolutionize the world.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.865 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do it.

00:58:45.865 --> 00:58:48.410 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to do a thing
with trance channelers

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:51.110 align:middle line:10%
on DNA, which hasn't
been done yet.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:52.062 align:middle line:10%
It's been done once.

00:58:52.062 --> 00:58:53.270 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to duplicate it.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:55.160 align:middle line:84%
If that experiment
gets duplicated,

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.220 align:middle line:90%
the whole world changes.

00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.637 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it just
changes overnight.

00:58:57.637 --> 00:59:01.070 align:middle line:84%
But trance channelers, if
you look at their gamma,

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.740 align:middle line:90%
they're up at 45 to 50.

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's this idea
of plasticity,

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.760 align:middle line:84%
where they are able to
create this brain that's

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:09.800 align:middle line:90%
able to do this.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.592 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
doing is dissociating.

00:59:11.592 --> 00:59:12.800 align:middle line:90%
They're going into the field.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.930 align:middle line:10%
And so you have relay
channelers, people

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.670 align:middle line:10%
who are channeling an entity.

00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And so that's a lower level.

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.385 align:middle line:10%
So they're relaying
messages back and forth.

00:59:20.385 --> 00:59:22.760 align:middle line:10%
But a trance channeler is
somebody where they're actually

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:10%
in the field, and you actually
get dissociated people

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.928 align:middle line:10%
like multiple personality
disorder people.

00:59:27.928 --> 00:59:30.470 align:middle line:10%
And I started looking at some
of these people, but it's hard.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.550 align:middle line:10%
You can't really deal
with them, because it's

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:33.320 align:middle line:10%
like dealing with
people in AA and saying,

00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.195 align:middle line:10%
I want to experiment.

00:59:34.195 --> 00:59:36.770 align:middle line:10%
I want you to get drunk, because
I want to do an experiment.

00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:37.880 align:middle line:10%
So you're very careful.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:39.740 align:middle line:10%
And these people are
talking about the fact

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:10%
that eye color is changing
with multiple personality

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.310 align:middle line:10%
people, where when they're
being abused as children,

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:49.250 align:middle line:10%
these alters split off.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:52.400 align:middle line:10%
And some of them, the
one was an American guy

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:55.100 align:middle line:10%
who could speak Croatian, read
and write Croatian, and read

00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:59.740 align:middle line:10%
and write Arabic.

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:00.710 align:middle line:10%
And he was an American.

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:03.920 align:middle line:10%
And so this one woman,
she was speaking Italian.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.300 align:middle line:10%
And so I went on
to the Facebook,

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:08.720 align:middle line:10%
and I said to her, "One of
your alters speaks Italian.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.900 align:middle line:10%
Do you speak Italian?"

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:10.915 align:middle line:10%
She goes, "nope."

01:00:10.915 --> 01:00:14.220 align:middle line:10%
I said, "you ever been
around anybody Italian?"

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.020 align:middle line:10%
"Nope."

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And I go, "what?"

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.400 align:middle line:10%
And that's the thing.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.567 align:middle line:10%
And their eye color changes.

01:00:17.567 --> 01:00:18.680 align:middle line:10%
You hear these stories.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And that's DNA changing.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:23.420 align:middle line:10%
And the whole idea is
what is DNA, actually,

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.260 align:middle line:10%
if these alters--

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:27.150 align:middle line:10%
because some of the alters
will actually hand change.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:29.150 align:middle line:10%
They'll be a right-hander,
and one of the alters

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.950 align:middle line:10%
can be left-handed.

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.515 align:middle line:10%
Now, how can you
fake a left-hander?

01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:33.390 align:middle line:10%
Try to write with your
left hand and fake it.

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:34.190 align:middle line:10%
There's no way.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:35.243 align:middle line:10%
Or one has cancer.

01:00:35.243 --> 01:00:36.660 align:middle line:10%
The other one
doesn't have cancer.

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:37.460 align:middle line:10%
One has diabetes.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.020 align:middle line:10%
The other one doesn't
have diabetes.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.580 align:middle line:10%
And you see these changes.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.050 align:middle line:10%
You can see these alters.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.330 align:middle line:10%
And so what we're
believing about DNA, I say,

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.400 align:middle line:10%
is completely going
to be off base,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.135 align:middle line:10%
when you start to look at
the paranormal literature.

01:00:49.135 --> 01:00:50.510 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
you look, is you

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:53.090 align:middle line:10%
look at the bizarre paranormal
stuff that doesn't make sense,

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:54.632 align:middle line:10%
because that's where
the answers are.

01:00:54.632 --> 01:00:56.990 align:middle line:10%
As long as you keep
running down the same road

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:58.448 align:middle line:10%
and repeating the
same experiments,

01:00:58.448 --> 01:00:59.990 align:middle line:10%
you're never going
to learn anything.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.510 align:middle line:10%
You've got to go to the weird
stuff that ain't working,

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:03.385 align:middle line:10%
the red flags.

01:01:03.385 --> 01:01:05.510 align:middle line:10%
That's what's going to tell
you what you got wrong.

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:07.208 align:middle line:10%
So trance channeling
is, I think,

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.750 align:middle line:10%
one of the most
important modalities.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.910 align:middle line:10%
If you can get a real
good trance channeler,

01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:12.290 align:middle line:10%
you're right in the field.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.020 align:middle line:10%
You are interacting
with the field,

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.030 align:middle line:10%
and you can actually
ask questions.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.580 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing is the big one.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Here's where you see
these crossovers here.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.350 align:middle line:10%
The top three remote viewers
all have synesthesia.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
The ability that you can see
colors with numbers and stuff

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:29.890 align:middle line:10%
like that.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.820 align:middle line:10%
The top three.

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
So you start seeing these
crossovers with these people.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.470 align:middle line:10%
Or you see Joe McMoneagle.

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.470 align:middle line:10%
They picked him, and
they tell this story.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:39.220 align:middle line:10%
They picked him, and
when he did his file,

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.340 align:middle line:10%
when they did the
interview, they

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.580 align:middle line:10%
wanted to know all about
his near-death experience.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.080 align:middle line:10%
And you see these crossovers,
that a lot of these people

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:51.698 align:middle line:10%
have this trauma thing, or they
have other brain things that

01:01:51.698 --> 01:01:52.990 align:middle line:10%
show you something is going on.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:55.240 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned this with
remote viewers help,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.880 align:middle line:10%
Puthoff's got this, that the
shape, color, and texture

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.030 align:middle line:10%
are right, so all the right
brain things are correct.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.670 align:middle line:10%
And all the left things, that
left brain, name, function,

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and size, that a lot of
the bigger remote viewers

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.730 align:middle line:10%
were getting wrong.

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:07.600 align:middle line:10%
They just couldn't pick it up.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.460 align:middle line:10%
They couldn't actually
identify what it was.

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.918 align:middle line:10%
They could just
tell you the shape.

01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:12.578 align:middle line:10%
And that's why they
give you a number.

01:02:12.578 --> 01:02:14.620 align:middle line:10%
Instead of telling you
this is a target in Egypt,

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:15.520 align:middle line:10%
because your left
brain is going to go,

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.680 align:middle line:10%
I know what it is, they
just give you a number.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.356 align:middle line:10%


01:02:20.356 --> 01:02:22.600 align:middle line:10%
They don't want to do
this analytical overlay.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.760 align:middle line:10%
They want to cut
the left brain out.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.650 align:middle line:84%
That's why they give
you just a number,

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to stop the left
brain from guessing.

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
They want your right brain
to do the information.

01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Out-of-body experiences,
people know about this.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.660 align:middle line:84%
You're in a Field your
brain has been shut off.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:42.796 align:middle line:84%
Even if you've got an
out-of-body experience

01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:45.250 align:middle line:84%
where the brain is
completely shut down,

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:48.190 align:middle line:90%
it's like a flat brain pattern.

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet the person is
saying, I was in this field.

01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:52.180 align:middle line:90%
There was unconditional love.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.510 align:middle line:10%
There was peace,
it was beautiful,

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.218 align:middle line:10%
and it was more real
than the real world.

01:02:57.218 --> 01:02:59.677 align:middle line:10%
Everybody says the same thing,
whether it's lucid dreaming,

01:02:59.677 --> 01:03:01.420 align:middle line:10%
whether it's
psychedelics, whether it's

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.628 align:middle line:10%
out-of-body experiences,
they all say the same thing.

01:03:03.628 --> 01:03:05.350 align:middle line:10%
It is more real
than the real world.

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.210 align:middle line:90%
The real world is the dream.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
They all say the same thing.

01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:12.150 align:middle line:10%
And we should start
learning from that,

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.830 align:middle line:10%
whereas modern science says,
no, this is just the illusion.

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:16.090 align:middle line:10%
The real world is here.

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.950 align:middle line:10%
So we've got this
upside-down thinking.

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:21.100 align:middle line:10%
Dreams, here I'm going
to play you a video.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.283 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's heard of Google.

01:03:22.283 --> 01:03:23.950 align:middle line:10%
You want to know where
Google came from?

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:25.870 align:middle line:10%
Here's the video of
where Google comes from.

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.170 align:middle line:10%
It came in a dream.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.250 align:middle line:10%
And in my book, I have a
lot of stories about dreams.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.895 align:middle line:10%
Here's where Google came from.

01:03:32.895 --> 01:03:34.270 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll explain
to what he said.

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.437 align:middle line:84%
Basically, he says I wake
up in the middle of night.

01:03:36.437 --> 01:03:38.025 align:middle line:84%
He says, sometimes
you have a dream.

01:03:38.025 --> 01:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the
middle of night,

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.940 align:middle line:90%
I had one of those dreams.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, you've
got to stop dreaming

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and start working.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:45.610 align:middle line:90%
And he started writing it down.

01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And the idea came to him.

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:48.370 align:middle line:10%
I should put all
the links together.

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:50.453 align:middle line:10%
Take all the internet links
and put them together.

01:03:50.453 --> 01:03:52.207 align:middle line:10%
And he went to his
advisor, and he said,

01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:53.290 align:middle line:10%
I think we should do this.

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.100 align:middle line:10%
I could do this
probably in two weeks.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.400 align:middle line:10%
And he said, at least his
advisor didn't put him down.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.180 align:middle line:10%
He said, "Yeah, go
ahead with that."

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.430 align:middle line:10%
That's where Google came from.

01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:02.180 align:middle line:10%
It came in a dream in
the middle of night.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:06.670 align:middle line:10%
So he tells this
story at a conference,

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:09.470 align:middle line:10%
where he's at a graduation.

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Psychic, of course, we know.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.598 align:middle line:84%
Precognition, oral readings,
psychic archaeology.

01:04:14.598 --> 01:04:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And again, it's the same thing.

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.960 align:middle line:10%
Psychics are dissociating.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.910 align:middle line:10%
They're able to move,
and a lot of them

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:23.000 align:middle line:10%
have the same issues, where
they've got some sort of thing

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.200 align:middle line:10%
in their background that
caused them to become psychic.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Mediums, and people
will say, well,

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:29.520 align:middle line:10%
it's the same as psychics.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.330 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, it is.

01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.410 align:middle line:10%
It's all the same thing.

01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:32.490 align:middle line:10%
We're just parsing it.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.920 align:middle line:90%
We're giving it different words.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Mediumship, I talked to
this guy outside of LA,

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.750 align:middle line:90%
where he was talking about this.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Dissociative identity disorder.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.900 align:middle line:10%
When I started looking
at these people, I mean,

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:43.880 align:middle line:10%
when you start looking at the
stuff these people are doing,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.200 align:middle line:10%
it's just so bizarre.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.030 align:middle line:10%
They're right on the mark.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:49.330 align:middle line:10%
They're talking
about paranormal.

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:51.320 align:middle line:10%
I think 1% of them
have these very bizarre

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.798 align:middle line:10%
paranormal abilities
and stuff like that,

01:04:53.798 --> 01:04:56.090 align:middle line:10%
or they can speak foreign
languages that they shouldn't

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.010 align:middle line:10%
be able to speak,
or they suddenly

01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:00.800 align:middle line:10%
lose a disease, their
eye color changes.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.370 align:middle line:10%
All these bizarre things
that are happening.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Mediumship.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics is of course
one of the biggest ones.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is the whole
thing about the ego.

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:11.773 align:middle line:84%
Where they they'll say in a
high dose, like a hero dose of--

01:05:11.773 --> 01:05:13.940 align:middle line:84%
they call it a hero dose
when you take the big dose,

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
where the ego is crushed.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.250 align:middle line:90%
It is destroyed.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.923 align:middle line:84%
The person is dying, and
suddenly ego is crushed,

01:05:19.923 --> 01:05:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and then you suddenly
realize everything

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:24.050 align:middle line:84%
is alive and conscious,
and the famous story

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.380 align:middle line:84%
from Sting the musician,
who told the thing where

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.730 align:middle line:84%
he was there, and he looks down
at the little plant growing out

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:34.280 align:middle line:84%
of the crack, and he
said, that's my brother.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.840 align:middle line:90%
And he realized this connection.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
Or Dennis McKenna, who
is a pharmacologist.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Terence McKenna's brother,
who did a lot of experiments,

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.630 align:middle line:10%
had gone down there,
and the ayahuasca

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:47.720 align:middle line:10%
had told him that you're
destroying the planet, almost

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.880 align:middle line:10%
the vision that experiencers
see aboard the ship

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.890 align:middle line:10%
with the screen, you're
destroying the planet.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:55.470 align:middle line:10%
And he was all upset, and how
could you let this happen?

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:59.510 align:middle line:10%
And then suddenly the
ayahuasca voice says,

01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:03.170 align:middle line:10%
"Do you think we're actually
going to let this happen?

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:05.640 align:middle line:10%
You monkeys just think
you're running the place."

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:06.900 align:middle line:10%
And so you get these visions.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.610 align:middle line:10%
It's just bizarre.

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:09.027 align:middle line:10%
When you look at
the psychedelics,

01:06:09.027 --> 01:06:12.950 align:middle line:10%
you start to see what reality
may actually look like.

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:16.940 align:middle line:10%
Chanting is the same thing as
this slow, fast thing, where

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:20.693 align:middle line:10%
you're chanting and
people will report being

01:06:20.693 --> 01:06:21.860 align:middle line:10%
able to move into the field.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Automatic writing, which is
what I started in the '70s.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.638 align:middle line:84%
In the '50s, the
Canadians were using this.

01:06:27.638 --> 01:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a woman
who actually taught

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.867 align:middle line:90%
the CIA to channel an alien.

01:06:30.867 --> 01:06:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And they channeled an alien
at the National Photographic

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.430 align:middle line:90%
Interpretation Center.

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And this ship went by, Robert
Friend, the head of Blue Book,

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.020 align:middle line:90%
actually tells this on camera.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:39.820 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating story.

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It was a woman who started
with automatic writing,

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:43.977 align:middle line:84%
and then she was able to
leave the automatic writing

01:06:43.977 --> 01:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and go into just getting
the messages out doing

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:46.940 align:middle line:90%
automatic writing.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.310 align:middle line:10%
All the Mission Rama
people, I remember

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:53.150 align:middle line:10%
last year we were
at Mount Shasta,

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:54.710 align:middle line:10%
and this event happened.

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
get into the event.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:07:00.770 align:middle line:10%
This event happens, and I
don't get the Portal Zenra

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:03.720 align:middle line:10%
thing that Paula got, but this
thing starts over my head.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.300 align:middle line:10%
But the most amazing thing was,
and I was just kicking myself

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.580 align:middle line:10%
I didn't bring my camera,
because I'm sitting right

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.510 align:middle line:10%
beside Ricardo.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And after the event starts, he
starts this automatic writing.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:11.737 align:middle line:10%
And I'm watching this.

01:07:11.737 --> 01:07:14.395 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, oh, his hand's
moving like a mile a minute.

01:07:14.395 --> 01:07:15.770 align:middle line:10%
His wife is laying
out the thing,

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:17.270 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going why
don't I have my camera?

01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:19.562 align:middle line:10%
It was the most bizarre thing
I'd ever seen in my life,

01:07:19.562 --> 01:07:21.710 align:middle line:10%
how fast he was writing,
and it's in pitch black,

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:22.550 align:middle line:10%
and it's cold.

01:07:22.550 --> 01:07:24.650 align:middle line:10%
And so automatic
writing is this thing.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.590 align:middle line:10%
And again, these people
are dissociating.

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:28.810 align:middle line:10%
They're moving in.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:31.550 align:middle line:10%
Francis Swann and the Canadians
were actually using it.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.440 align:middle line:10%
Wilbur Smith, his
wife who was secretary

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.940 align:middle line:10%
to the speaker of
the Senate, he was

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.710 align:middle line:10%
the guy that ran the
Canadian UFO program,

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:39.180 align:middle line:10%
they were doing this automatic
writing stuff all the time.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.280 align:middle line:90%
So it's been known.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Breathing came from this
holotropic breathing.

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
That came from people
coming out of LSD,

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:48.997 align:middle line:84%
and they were doing
this breathing thing

01:07:48.997 --> 01:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
to try to stay with
the effect of the drug.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And so they developed
this technique,

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and it's the same thing.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%
They use breathing.

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So you just use this
breathing pattern,

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and you do the
same thing as LSD.

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.450 align:middle line:10%
You can move into the field
just by doing this breathing

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:03.010 align:middle line:10%
pattern.

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Telepathy, this is one
of the more bizarre ones,

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:07.470 align:middle line:10%
and hopefully this video works.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:10.410 align:middle line:10%
Telepathy, there's a lot of
experiments done on telepathy.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.900 align:middle line:10%
And telepathy, one of
the best experiments

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.234 align:middle line:10%
there is with
telepathy has to do

01:08:15.234 --> 01:08:17.609 align:middle line:10%
with the whole idea of the
right brain, left brain thing.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.132 align:middle line:10%
There are some kids,
and this is one of them.

01:08:20.132 --> 01:08:21.590 align:middle line:10%
She is in the United
Arab Emirates.

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.550 align:middle line:10%
I actually wrote
the reporters who

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:25.029 align:middle line:10%
had actually dealt with her.

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:28.859 align:middle line:10%
She's basically
purely telepathic.

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.359 align:middle line:10%
And she has left brain damage.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.399 align:middle line:10%
She's non-verbal autistic.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:35.292 align:middle line:10%
So if you have a
nonverbal autistic child,

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:36.750 align:middle line:10%
you're going to
have them with some

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.550 align:middle line:10%
of these really
bizarre abilities

01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:39.508 align:middle line:10%
to be able to do stuff.

01:08:39.508 --> 01:08:42.092 align:middle line:10%
And the whole idea is, the left
brain is completely shut down,

01:08:42.092 --> 01:08:42.960 align:middle line:10%
and it's by trauma.

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.600 align:middle line:10%
It's a brain injury, or
it's a disease, or whatever.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.870 align:middle line:10%
So when you get these
non-verbal autistic children,

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:52.253 align:middle line:10%
and all they can do
is touch a keypad.

01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:53.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm going to
show you a video

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:55.260 align:middle line:10%
here that Diane Hennacy Powell--

01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:00.359 align:middle line:10%
I told Diane Hennacy Powell, I
said, if it was a fair world,

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:01.776 align:middle line:10%
you'd be Nobel Prize.

01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:02.859 align:middle line:10%
But it's not a fair world.

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:05.399 align:middle line:10%
She can't even get
funding for this research.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.290 align:middle line:10%
And she's got one,
her name is Haley.

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:10.319 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to show you a
video, a short video of Haley.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:14.399 align:middle line:10%
Haley at one point does
162 numbers in a row right.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:15.359 align:middle line:10%
She can't speak.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.422 align:middle line:10%
She flips out if you do
anything, change anything

01:09:17.422 --> 01:09:18.630 align:middle line:10%
in the room, stuff like that.

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:22.530 align:middle line:10%
So Diane Hennacy Powell's
doing a lot on this ESP,

01:09:22.530 --> 01:09:25.080 align:middle line:10%
and she's working with
these autistic children who

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.444 align:middle line:10%
have this left brain
damage and the abilities

01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:28.319 align:middle line:10%
that these kids have.

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.390 align:middle line:10%
So basically they're
doing a calculation.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:32.010 align:middle line:10%
It's about 18 numbers right.

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And this little girl,
she's just going boop.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.149 align:middle line:10%
She touches this keypad,
three, and then she

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:39.210 align:middle line:10%
pushes a little screen
that she pushes three.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:40.800 align:middle line:10%
And then the girl
puts the thing back,

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.700 align:middle line:10%
and you can see the
numbers on the one side.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.950 align:middle line:10%
It's actually on the internet.

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:45.410 align:middle line:10%
It's called the
Telepathy Project.

01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:47.160 align:middle line:10%
And you see the numbers,
and she's going--

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.640 align:middle line:10%
and she's ticking off these
numbers as she goes along.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.800 align:middle line:10%
They'd doing this calculation,
this huge calculation

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.340 align:middle line:10%
of six digit number divided
by a three digit number,

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.390 align:middle line:10%
and she's getting the
answers, and she's

01:09:58.390 --> 01:10:00.620 align:middle line:10%
tipping the question
and the answer off.

01:10:00.620 --> 01:10:01.950 align:middle line:10%
It's absolutely dramatic.

01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:04.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's the whole deal,
is that the left brain

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:05.820 align:middle line:10%
is completely shut down.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:10.137 align:middle line:10%
And so hopefully we can get--

01:10:10.137 --> 01:10:11.720 align:middle line:10%
this next video is
even more dramatic,

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.220 align:middle line:10%
and it's probably
not going to play.

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:14.720 align:middle line:10%
So here's rapid image cycling.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.200 align:middle line:10%
So rapid image
cycling is something

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.283 align:middle line:10%
I was actually trained on.

01:10:17.283 --> 01:10:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And this is a connection
across to UFOs.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.390 align:middle line:10%
Rapid image cycling,
when I saw it,

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:24.390 align:middle line:10%
I went, they're shutting
the left brain down.

01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:26.760 align:middle line:10%
And what rapid image
cycling is, it's

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.140 align:middle line:10%
called the Bankston Method.

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.320 align:middle line:10%
It is called the Cadillac of
all energy healing methods.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And they claim that they
can take the most aggressive

01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.300 align:middle line:10%
cancer, as long as there's
no chemotherapy or radiation,

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.040 align:middle line:10%
and they can cure it,
and they can do it.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.582 align:middle line:10%
And they do it with
this rapid image.

01:10:39.582 --> 01:10:41.460 align:middle line:10%
And what they do, it
was taught by a psychic,

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.950 align:middle line:10%
who taught it to William
Bankston who was a sociologist.

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And William wanted to know how
could this guy cure people?

01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:47.448 align:middle line:10%
How could he make
clouds disappear?

01:10:47.448 --> 01:10:48.910 align:middle line:10%
He could do all
this kind of stuff.

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And so he said, well,
you do this image thing.

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:53.760 align:middle line:10%
So what you do is,
you take ego images.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.170 align:middle line:10%
You can't want to
save the world.

01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:55.950 align:middle line:10%
That's a right brain image.

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:56.590 align:middle line:10%
You can't use that.

01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:58.380 align:middle line:10%
You've got to use, oh, I want
a car, I want a motor home,

01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.250 align:middle line:10%
I want a new house.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.920 align:middle line:10%
And you take 20 images,
and you take those images,

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.270 align:middle line:10%
and you start to memorize them.

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:05.937 align:middle line:10%
And you memorize the images, and
then you go faster, and faster,

01:11:05.937 --> 01:11:08.312 align:middle line:10%
and these images are going
through your head, the images.

01:11:08.312 --> 01:11:10.110 align:middle line:10%
And they teach you to
put them on a wheel,

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:12.195 align:middle line:10%
and then you spin the wheel,
and you spin this wheel really,

01:11:12.195 --> 01:11:14.520 align:middle line:10%
really fast, and you can
put 2,000 images or whatever

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.770 align:middle line:10%
in your head in a second.

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:19.950 align:middle line:10%
And what you're doing is, you're
sending the ego for coffee,

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:20.940 align:middle line:10%
saying get out of here.

01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And as William
Bankston said, you're

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.857 align:middle line:10%
getting the healer
out of the way.

01:11:23.857 --> 01:11:26.190 align:middle line:10%
And then when I went for the
training, I was in Chicago,

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:28.232 align:middle line:10%
and I said, they're shutting
down the left brain.

01:11:28.232 --> 01:11:29.430 align:middle line:10%
There's no doubt about it.

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.590 align:middle line:10%
They say, every single
healer, the heat

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:33.180 align:middle line:10%
comes out your left hand.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:34.260 align:middle line:10%
So it's right brain.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:36.450 align:middle line:10%
You shut the left brain down,
the right brain gets activated,

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:37.410 align:middle line:10%
the heat comes out
your left hand.

01:11:37.410 --> 01:11:38.490 align:middle line:10%
I thought, nah, it's
not going to work.

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.573 align:middle line:10%
Not going to work with me.

01:11:39.573 --> 01:11:41.370 align:middle line:10%
I went into the
healing session, and I

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.590 align:middle line:10%
was in the healing session,
and this girl was there.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.448 align:middle line:10%
I put my hand, I fell over.

01:11:45.448 --> 01:11:47.365 align:middle line:10%
This heat started coming
out of the left hand.

01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:49.020 align:middle line:10%
I go, this actually works.

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.060 align:middle line:10%
The thing with
that is, that it's

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.620 align:middle line:10%
called rapid image cycling.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.570 align:middle line:10%
If you know the
story of the kids,

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:58.700 align:middle line:10%
the kids in Rwanda, in 1994--

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.300 align:middle line:10%
Sid, I think you
photographed this--

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:01.800 align:middle line:10%
She was in Brampton, Ontario.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.810 align:middle line:10%
Her name is Emily Trim.

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:04.770 align:middle line:10%
She tells this story.

01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.730 align:middle line:10%
She says, they're walking
along, and you know the story.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.450 align:middle line:10%
There's 62 kills schoolkids.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.267 align:middle line:10%
The UFO lands.

01:12:10.267 --> 01:12:12.100 align:middle line:10%
The aliens come out of
the ship or whatever.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.640 align:middle line:10%
And her and this girl are
running along the logs

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.070 align:middle line:10%
on the edge of this schoolyard.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:17.820 align:middle line:10%
And she says, suddenly
she sees this flash

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.980 align:middle line:10%
over the side of her
eye, and she looks,

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:20.980 align:middle line:10%
and they're on this log.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:22.855 align:middle line:10%
So they're bouncing up
and down on these logs

01:12:22.855 --> 01:12:25.340 align:middle line:10%
as they're running along, and
this alien is beside them,

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.910 align:middle line:10%
and it's imitating them.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.695 align:middle line:84%
It's hovering, but
it's imitating them.

01:12:28.695 --> 01:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at this alien, and
all of a sudden, boom, thing's

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.120 align:middle line:90%
in front of her.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And the way she describes
it is, she says,

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.600 align:middle line:10%
it was in front of us, and there
was boom, boom, boom, boom,

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.650 align:middle line:10%
boom, these images were
coming into her head.

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:40.250 align:middle line:10%
And when I heard her
say that, I went,

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.100 align:middle line:10%
that's rapid image cycling.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.870 align:middle line:10%
It's the same thing.

01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:43.120 align:middle line:10%
They're doing the same thing.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.330 align:middle line:10%
And she was getting the
technological images,

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.920 align:middle line:10%
and then she started
to do painting,

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.500 align:middle line:10%
with all these symbols, and
she's done over 100 paintings.

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:52.440 align:middle line:10%
And her life was just
absolutely turned upside-down.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And it was these images coming,
these technological images.

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.000 align:middle line:10%
And the last one was
this giant explosion.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.260 align:middle line:10%
And she said that
doesn't mean the world is

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.220 align:middle line:10%
going to get destroyed.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.080 align:middle line:10%
The message was,
you've got technology,

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.160 align:middle line:10%
but you could do better.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.350 align:middle line:10%
The girl beside her is
getting environmental images

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:07.790 align:middle line:10%
at this very high rapid rate
coming into her head like that.

01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:10.540 align:middle line:10%
So I hear that story, and
you see these connections.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.160 align:middle line:10%
All the modalities
are the same thing.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm listening to Suzy Hansen.

01:13:13.630 --> 01:13:16.270 align:middle line:10%
Does everybody know who Suzy
Hansen is from New Zealand?

01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:18.460 align:middle line:10%
Very famous, written
a couple books.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.650 align:middle line:10%
You've got to read her
books on abduction.

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:23.860 align:middle line:10%
She's on board the
ship numerous times.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.060 align:middle line:10%
She's shown this technology.

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.440 align:middle line:10%
She tells this story.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:29.620 align:middle line:10%
February of 2010 they
take us to a theater.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.458 align:middle line:10%
It's down in some
sort of theater thing.

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.250 align:middle line:10%
And we're all sitting
there, and this being

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:34.700 align:middle line:10%
is standing on the screen.

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:37.270 align:middle line:10%
And she says, we're
sitting there in the room,

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:39.020 align:middle line:10%
and the being leaves,
and all of a sudden,

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.740 align:middle line:10%
boom, there's an environmental
image on the screen.

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.467 align:middle line:10%
Boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:13:44.467 --> 01:13:45.550 align:middle line:10%
And she's describing this.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:46.990 align:middle line:10%
And they're going
faster and faster.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.615 align:middle line:10%
And she says, and at
one point, there's

01:13:48.615 --> 01:13:52.270 align:middle line:10%
over 100 a second going
on the movie screen.

01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:54.040 align:middle line:10%
And they taught us how to do it.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And I went, that's
rapid image cycling.

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, the
people were crying.

01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.228 align:middle line:90%
There was emotion.

01:13:59.228 --> 01:14:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were sitting
there watching these images

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.070 align:middle line:90%
on the screen.

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And then the being comes out,
and he puts his hand like this,

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.297 align:middle line:90%
and everybody stops crying.

01:14:06.297 --> 01:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody, all the emotion,
and the emotion is in there,

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:10.690 align:middle line:84%
and this is how they
embed the message.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And then they go.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.100 align:middle line:10%
So you see these
crossovers between healing,

01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.900 align:middle line:10%
between aliens, and
all this sort of stuff.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.270 align:middle line:10%
And you see this thing
with the healing thing.

01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:22.740 align:middle line:10%
It's exactly the same sort of
technique that they're using.

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Ariel
School, Suzy Hansen,

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:29.030 align:middle line:10%
the Bankston best subject,
here was one I just learned.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.830 align:middle line:10%
Koans.

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:30.670 align:middle line:10%
I didn't realize this.

01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.590 align:middle line:10%
This is this thing about
"what's the sound of one hand

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:33.140 align:middle line:10%
clapping?"

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Sid knew this.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.727 align:middle line:10%
I didn't even know
these things existed.

01:14:35.727 --> 01:14:37.420 align:middle line:10%
And what it is, and
they describe it,

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.570 align:middle line:10%
the koans is to defy
your left brain.

01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Your left brain's
trying to figure it out.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.665 align:middle line:10%
Like, what is the sound
of one hand clapping?

01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:45.040 align:middle line:10%
And it shuts your
left brain out.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.165 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know these things.

01:14:46.165 --> 01:14:49.030 align:middle line:10%
And so Diane Hennacy--

01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:51.510 align:middle line:10%
Diane Pasulka talks about these,
that they know about this.

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:52.180 align:middle line:10%
And it's the same thing.

01:14:52.180 --> 01:14:53.328 align:middle line:10%
It's this modality thing.

01:14:53.328 --> 01:14:54.370 align:middle line:10%
Then you get frequencies.

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:56.470 align:middle line:10%
Music, we know music is done.

01:14:56.470 --> 01:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Drumming, binaural beats,
forced dissociation.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm almost out of time.

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.800 align:middle line:90%
So you have this trauma.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Forced dissociation is,
you're not in control.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.710 align:middle line:84%
So here's the Brazilian
children that are abused.

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:15.430 align:middle line:10%
Epilepsy, a lot of epileptics
have paranormal experiences.

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.660 align:middle line:10%
Stanley Krippner said
almost every shaman

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.900 align:middle line:10%
he'd ever met in his
life had some sort

01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.570 align:middle line:10%
of epileptic background.

01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.690 align:middle line:10%
And this is the idea.

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:26.440 align:middle line:10%
So you think it's a thing,
but a part of the brain

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.830 align:middle line:10%
is able to shut off, and
they get this sort of things.

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Synesthesia, a lot of
them have this thing.

01:15:32.890 --> 01:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Daniel Tammet does all
these calculations.

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:39.070 align:middle line:84%
He's able to speak
Icelandic in one week.

01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
In one week, learn
Icelandic in one week.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Alien abduction
is the same thing.

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I start to
think of this thing

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.850 align:middle line:90%
where they show the screen.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.767 align:middle line:84%
I always ask people,
have you seen the screen?

01:15:47.767 --> 01:15:49.540 align:middle line:84%
39% of people say
they've seen the screen.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "why do
you think they're

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:51.190 align:middle line:90%
showing you the screen?"

01:15:51.190 --> 01:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, they're testing
my emotions."

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to think
it may be trauma.

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:56.483 align:middle line:84%
They just want
you to dissociate.

01:15:56.483 --> 01:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
They're giving you a
message about we're

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
destroying the world and
stuff, but they're also

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:01.300 align:middle line:90%
forcing you to dissociate.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So you get these things, and
you see these common patterns.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.780 align:middle line:90%
Loss of time and space.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So people will describe
time and space.

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.090 align:middle line:90%
They're fooling around.

01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Aliens are fooling around
with time and space.

01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.930 align:middle line:10%
No, they're just shutting
these parts of the brain down.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:14.920 align:middle line:10%
There is no time and space.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.300 align:middle line:10%
You just think they're
fooling around with it.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.100 align:middle line:10%
They're not.

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.800 align:middle line:10%
So we make these
false assumptions,

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.350 align:middle line:10%
but you see these things.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:21.310 align:middle line:10%
And rapid cycling.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.768 align:middle line:10%
The aliens are
using rapid cycling.

01:16:22.768 --> 01:16:25.600 align:middle line:10%


01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.378 align:middle line:10%
37% of all experiencers had
an out-of-body experience.

01:16:29.378 --> 01:16:30.920 align:middle line:10%
I remember they
telling me, "well, we

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.090 align:middle line:10%
need a committee to
figure this out."

01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:33.640 align:middle line:10%
I said, "you don't
need a committee.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.555 align:middle line:10%
You've just got to make
the right assumptions.

01:16:34.555 --> 01:16:36.222 align:middle line:10%
Is it one life or is
it multiple lives?"

01:16:36.222 --> 01:16:37.870 align:middle line:10%
If it's one life,
then yeah, the aliens

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:39.370 align:middle line:10%
may be taking you
against your will,

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:41.680 align:middle line:10%
and you may be having some
random out-of-body experience.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.000 align:middle line:10%
But if it's multiple
lives, maybe you

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.410 align:middle line:10%
chose to have the
out-of-body experience,

01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:46.712 align:middle line:10%
and you chose to be an abductee
to learn certain things

01:16:46.712 --> 01:16:47.920 align:middle line:10%
or to bring certain messages.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:49.210 align:middle line:10%
Maybe it's not random.

01:16:49.210 --> 01:16:51.370 align:middle line:10%
And people always make
this idea that it's random.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:54.910 align:middle line:10%
40% of all experiencers
state at one

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.040 align:middle line:10%
point during their experience
they knew the answer

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.360 align:middle line:10%
to everything in the universe.

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And people say, "oh,
it's just anecdotal.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
listen to these people.

01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just anecdotal.

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:02.420 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
aboard a ship.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
They just think they're having
an experience with an alien.

01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't really care."

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.857 align:middle line:84%
If 40% of them claim they knew
everything in the universe,

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.933 align:middle line:84%
don't you think you should
talk to these people?

01:17:09.933 --> 01:17:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would you
ignore these people?

01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:13.907 align:middle line:84%
42% say they have
scientific, technical,

01:17:13.907 --> 01:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
or mathematical
material in their head

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:16.907 align:middle line:84%
that they did not
learn in school.

01:17:16.907 --> 01:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I had a girl show me a
paper in here in California.

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Shows me the thing, it
was like 25 pages long

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.570 align:middle line:90%
on her cell phone.

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I said, "that's pretty cool.

01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:23.883 align:middle line:90%
Did you write that?"

01:17:23.883 --> 01:17:26.070 align:middle line:84%
"Yeah, all these
equations and stuff."

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Says, "I don't know
nothing about science.

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:28.780 align:middle line:90%
It just came into my head."

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.155 align:middle line:10%
And you get these
people, they're

01:17:30.155 --> 01:17:31.750 align:middle line:10%
walking around
with this material

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:33.010 align:middle line:10%
that they got in the field.

01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Fever.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Fever is one.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:40.290 align:middle line:10%
The theory of natural
selection came not from Darwin.

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:42.790 align:middle line:10%
Darwin stole it from Wallace
or whatever the guy's name was.

01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:43.600 align:middle line:10%
He had a fever.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.460 align:middle line:10%
He had this horrible
fever, and he had

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.260 align:middle line:10%
this idea of natural selection.

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.390 align:middle line:10%
And Darwin grabbed
it and became famous.

01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Pain.

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:51.490 align:middle line:90%
Pain is big.

01:17:51.490 --> 01:17:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It induces out-of-body
experiences.

01:17:53.050 --> 01:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
There's famous-- some
of these nuns who

01:17:56.830 --> 01:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
have this paranormal stuff
that they're famous for.

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Fasting, vegetarianism,
lack of sleep

01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:03.820 align:middle line:90%
can cause you to dissociate.

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%
People will describe this.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.805 align:middle line:84%
Sensory deprivation,
going into the tanks.

01:18:08.805 --> 01:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
do the book, I'll

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
get into more detail
with a lot of this.

01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Brain injury, Edgar Cayce
had the brain injury.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Vietnam vets, they were
using people, Vietnam vets,

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.610 align:middle line:84%
the guys that could pick
out where the mines were.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were using
these guys, because they

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.320 align:middle line:90%
seemed to sense this.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Brain injury, Peter Hurkos,
one of the top psychics

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.900 align:middle line:90%
of all time, fell off a ladder.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.770 align:middle line:90%
That's where he had.

01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:31.780 align:middle line:90%
Blind Tom had brain damage.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And here was his
famous thing, He

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:35.830 align:middle line:84%
had a repertoire of
over 7,000 songs.

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
His favorite feat was
playing "Yankee Doodle" in B

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.430 align:middle line:84%
flat with his right,
"Fisher's Hornpipe" in C

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.790 align:middle line:84%
with his left hand while
singing "Early in the Morning"

01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:46.745 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

01:18:46.745 --> 01:18:47.870 align:middle line:90%
And the brain is shut down.

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:49.510 align:middle line:90%
And these are like savants.

01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Also savants have
left brain damage.

01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:52.405 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

01:18:52.405 --> 01:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It gives them these abilities,
these bizarre abilities

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:55.530 align:middle line:90%
to do things.

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:57.655 align:middle line:10%
Here's the one that I'm
sorry is not going to play.

01:18:57.655 --> 01:18:59.700 align:middle line:10%
This is the one that proves
that it's left brain.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'll end with this,
because this is famously

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.090 align:middle line:10%
called the Sack's Twins.

01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:07.030 align:middle line:10%
These were guys in the 1960s
who were able to do 15,

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.430 align:middle line:10%
16 digit prime.

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:11.860 align:middle line:10%
A lot of autistic people
have this obsession

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:14.058 align:middle line:10%
with prime numbers, and
they could do 15, 16 digit.

01:19:14.058 --> 01:19:15.850 align:middle line:10%
One would give, and
he'd give the next one.

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:16.945 align:middle line:10%
Next one, next.

01:19:16.945 --> 01:19:18.880 align:middle line:10%
And there was not an
algorithm to figure out

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.110 align:middle line:10%
where they were even right.

01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.953 align:middle line:10%
They didn't know.

01:19:20.953 --> 01:19:22.870 align:middle line:10%
These kids could do
mathematical calculations.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:25.580 align:middle line:10%
And on this video,
that's not going to play,

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:28.360 align:middle line:10%
they actually do
calculations, 93,343

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.280 align:middle line:10%
on July 11th what day it'll be.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:33.100 align:middle line:10%
Or they'll say, in
the next 20,000 years,

01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:35.148 align:middle line:10%
what years will Easter
fall on April 3rd?

01:19:35.148 --> 01:19:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And they'll go "this year,
this year, this year,"

01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and they'll name
off all the years.

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.390 align:middle line:10%
And so you think, oh,
they're calculating.

01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:41.920 align:middle line:10%
So they show this thing,
and these two kids

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.450 align:middle line:10%
are doing these
calculations, and then

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:44.590 align:middle line:10%
they say to them at
the end, they said,

01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:45.970 align:middle line:10%
"let me ask you some
other questions.

01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:46.990 align:middle line:10%
You've done all
these calculations

01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:48.073 align:middle line:10%
for these different dates.

01:19:48.073 --> 01:19:50.080 align:middle line:10%
OK, let me ask you a question.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.540 align:middle line:10%
What's 7 times 4?"

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.025 align:middle line:10%
And the kid goes,
"I don't know."

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:54.400 align:middle line:10%
He said, "come
on, we taught you.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.150 align:middle line:10%
Don't you remember teaching?

01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:56.150 align:middle line:10%
Where did he teach you?"

01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:59.320 align:middle line:10%
"Oh, fourth floor, 1964, and
the ward, he names the doctor,

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.430 align:middle line:10%
he names, everything.

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:02.560 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "don't you remember
I was teaching you 7 times 4?

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "yeah,
I remember that."

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:04.570 align:middle line:10%
"So what's 7 times 4?"

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:05.942 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, "21?"

01:20:05.942 --> 01:20:07.150 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "could be more."

01:20:07.150 --> 01:20:08.320 align:middle line:10%
"Yeah, it could be more."

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.810 align:middle line:10%
And left brain is doing
simple calculation.

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.250 align:middle line:10%
They can do multiple
calculation,

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.950 align:middle line:10%
which is right brain,
this real elaborate stuff.

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:16.390 align:middle line:10%
But left brain
simple calculation.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:17.590 align:middle line:10%
They said, "you buy a shirt.

01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:18.390 align:middle line:10%
You got $10.

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.040 align:middle line:10%
You buy a shirt for $3, and
how much change have you got?"

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:22.510 align:middle line:10%
The kid goes, "I don't know."

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:23.650 align:middle line:10%
So they're not calculating.

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:26.740 align:middle line:10%
It's the same as the guy named
Daniel Tammet, the guy who's

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.975 align:middle line:10%
famous for doing pi to
22,514 places, the guy that

01:20:31.975 --> 01:20:33.370 align:middle line:10%
did Icelandic in one week.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:35.140 align:middle line:84%
He does the thing
where they ask him.

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:36.520 align:middle line:90%
And he can actually talk.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.022 align:middle line:10%
He's more verbal.

01:20:38.022 --> 01:20:39.980 align:middle line:10%
And they said, "how do
you do the calculations?

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.610 align:middle line:10%
You got these two huge numbers
multiplied to each other."

01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:44.360 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "well,
each one has a shape."

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.490 align:middle line:10%
He's a synesthesiac.

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.900 align:middle line:10%
So he's got the shape.

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:49.610 align:middle line:10%
So he says, "I watch the
one shape in my head.

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:51.640 align:middle line:10%
And then the other
shape is in my head,

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.827 align:middle line:10%
and I wait for the
center to fill in.

01:20:53.827 --> 01:20:55.660 align:middle line:10%
The center will fill
in with a certain shape

01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.120 align:middle line:10%
to make it uniform, and
it's a certain color.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.370 align:middle line:90%
And I know what that shape is.

01:21:00.370 --> 01:21:01.223 align:middle line:90%
That's the answer."

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:02.390 align:middle line:90%
He's not calculating at all.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.390 align:middle line:10%
He's waiting for a shape
to appear in his head.

01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:05.390 align:middle line:10%
And that's how it works.

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:07.060 align:middle line:10%
It's this dissociation.

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.170 align:middle line:10%
And the more we learn--

01:21:08.170 --> 01:21:09.050 align:middle line:10%
I'll end with this.

01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:12.130 align:middle line:10%
The more we learn, the more
we look at the neurology,

01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:15.190 align:middle line:10%
the more it proves that you
and I and all these people who

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:18.160 align:middle line:10%
said they had these
experiences were always right.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.450 align:middle line:10%
It is actually happening.

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:20.740 align:middle line:10%
It is not an illusion.

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.870 align:middle line:10%
You're actually going
into the real world.

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:25.330 align:middle line:10%
The mystery, the
illusionary world

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:27.700 align:middle line:10%
is the one that's created
by the bubble machine, which

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:28.540 align:middle line:10%
we call the brain.

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.440 align:middle line:10%
Thanks.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:38.560 align:middle line:90%
