00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.788 align:middle line:84%
So I have such
gifted students now,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and I've brought, actually,
a whole bunch of them

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.323 align:middle line:90%
here this weekend.

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
I hope you get a
chance to see them all.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Just check out the
schedule, and you'll

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
see that they're
sprinkled throughout.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Getting a little bit of
echo up here, you guys.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So great to be with
you, and I really

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
want to teach you and take you
through the Violet Flame today.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Before I take you
through the experience,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to give you a little bit
intellectual background on it.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I don't do that,
sometimes I reverse it.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.900 align:middle line:84%
But here, I think you'll
understand it better if you

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.320 align:middle line:90%
just know some of the basics.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:10%
So just a quick tiny bit on
how I discovered the flame.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.250 align:middle line:10%
I was a young, hard-charging
25-year-old lawyer

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.268 align:middle line:10%
in the fast track.

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Thought I had my life together.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Woke up with cancer
one morning, and went

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:90%
this is not part of my plan.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Sought some
alternative solutions.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Went to the doctor and
said, can I have some time?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:84%
They gave me about six
months, or I was going

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to have some invasive surgery.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This is early days
alternative medicine.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't much out there.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I stumbled on first,
meditation, then journaling.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Started to get in
touch with my emotions.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:90%
And then energy healing, wow.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:84%
What a deal that was, and on
my third visit to an energy

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
healer, I had an amazing
remission of the cancer.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:90%
And I really wanted--

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I know, it
was life changing--

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and so I wanted to know
what's the deal here?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I was positive
it was emotionally based.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.488 align:middle line:90%
And so I started looking.

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:07.530 align:middle line:90%
And I traveled the world.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
I've studied with healers,
sages, and shamans worldwide

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and would master the
skill, bring it back.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I had a private practice.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
This is more than 30 years
now I've been doing this.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And so that's why I'm up here.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, while I
was in India and Nepal,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I became exposed to
the Rays of Light.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:10%
And the Rays of Light, you
probably know about and just

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:10%
don't realize you
do because they're

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.610 align:middle line:10%
kind of endemic in our culture.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Here they are in the Upanishads.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:10%
This is 500 BC.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:10%
This is a photo of an
ancient Sanskrit script.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:10%
So the Hindus had
them, OK, actually,

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.360 align:middle line:10%
5,000 or 6,000 years
before they wrote it down.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:10%
And they knew that
these rays of light

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.620 align:middle line:10%
are also shared by every
culture I've ever studied.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:10%
So my childhood background
was the Catholic church.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.815 align:middle line:84%
And if you've been
exposed to that,

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
you know that the Dove
has the Seven Rays.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:90%
See the seven rays of light?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So does the Virgin Mary.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
She's got him coming
out of her hands, right?

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.680 align:middle line:10%
So today, we're living
on the seventh ray,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:10%
the Age of Aquarius.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:10%
That's why things actually
are so tumultuous.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.100 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure you've
noticed like I have--

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.350 align:middle line:10%
things are a bit stirred up.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Yes, yes.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:10%
They reappeared, so, really,
esoteric and important

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.850 align:middle line:10%
knowledge disappears.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:10%
And then it reappears
maybe hundreds if not

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:10%
thousands of years later.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:10%
It most recently reappeared in
the West with Madame Blavatsky.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:10%
She was kind of a character.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.670 align:middle line:10%
She was one of the early
originators of a philosophy

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.560 align:middle line:10%
called Theosophy.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.730 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty heavy reading.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't recommend
you launch into it.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:10%
But I've read all of it.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And the most important
thinker in this philosophy

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
which believe that--

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.680 align:middle line:84%
their principal theory is
that you can intuit divinity

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
through your own body.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
But you guys all
know that, right?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
But in the 1800s, this was
not a widely known idea.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We're just rediscovering
it ourselves.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So Alice Bailey is a really
prominent theosophical writer.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:90%
She wrote scads of books.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:90%
I spent years studying them.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.430 align:middle line:10%
She channeled this guy
Djwal Khul who is a Tibetan.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:10%
And I got a lot closer to
understanding the Seven Rays.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.830 align:middle line:10%
So remember, we're going to do
something on one of The Rays.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.580 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm telling
you about The Rays.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:10%
So the Seven Rays come from the
seven stars in the Big Dipper

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.980 align:middle line:10%
and the seven main
stars in the Pleiades.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:10%
So they're actually
coming from the cosmos

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:10%
as you might suspect, right?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of where you
expect them to come from.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to
digress just a moment

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and tell you about the
order of Melchizedek.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:10%
And The Rays, you're
on one right now.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:10%
You may be on two,
three, four, five.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:10%
A couple of you may be on all
seven at once working them.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:10%
You're literally working a Ray.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:10%
Your new information
about your path in life,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:10%
your spiritual goals,
your challenges,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:10%
all come through rays
both individually,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:10%
as well as societally.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.290 align:middle line:10%
So the whole society,
as I mentioned,

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.190 align:middle line:10%
is on the seventh ray right
now-- the Age of Aquarius.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:10%
And the order of
Melchizedek pre-Judaism

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:10%
if that helps you figure
out where in time I'm

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:10%
talking about.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.380 align:middle line:10%
Melchizedek was back in the
day when if you were a King,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:10%
you were also the priest.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.260 align:middle line:84%
You carried the bibe,
right, like Moses.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And Melchizedek was
the one who first

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.040 align:middle line:84%
developed a lot of
information about dimensions.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:10%
So now I'm going to talk
about dimensions for a minute.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:10%
You guys are living on
the Third Dimension.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:10%
This is actually where you're
living today because this

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.680 align:middle line:10%
is what society is.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty hard for you to
fight your way out of it.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.060 align:middle line:10%
In the Third
Dimension, you believe

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:10%
you can't walk through
that wall, right?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:10%
Anybody here think they can?

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:90%
I want to see you do it.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.620 align:middle line:90%
[QUIET LAUGHTER]

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're taught that
seeing is believing.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.400 align:middle line:84%
You believe what you
can touch and feel.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the Third Dimension.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.910 align:middle line:90%
It's very limiting.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.980 align:middle line:10%
There is a Fourth
Dimension, and that's

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:10%
where your paranormal
gifts start to appear.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:10%
So I got to the Fourth
Dimension a long time ago,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:10%
many years ago.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:10%
And what I noticed
right after I got

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:10%
there was I was terrified
of public speaking,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:10%
had never written a word.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
I was a lawyer.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, I
didn't write books.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
hit the Fourth Dimension,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, I'm out
speaking publicly every week.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:90%
I wrote four books.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm just hustling because now
I'm on the Fourth Dimension.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
My other gifts are
developing also,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
what I would call
baby healing gifts.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, nothing too exciting
but small healing abilities.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:90%
That's classic Fourth Dimension.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
On the Fourth Dimension,
there's more spaciousness.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
You might be visiting
it on occasion,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:90%
so I'll tell you what it's like.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything seems very spacious
on the Fourth Dimension.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't notice the
past or the future.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:90%
They all kind of merge.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:90%
So there's just like one--

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.660 align:middle line:90%
I just only know of one time.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Time becomes less linear
and much less important.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And anybody here
had some experiences

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.060 align:middle line:84%
they think that
are on the Fourth?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, see, I would think a
room here would definitely

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:90%
have some experiences there.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:84%
You can finally move there
if you get initiated,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:10%
So the Fifth Dimension--

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:10%
took me about 30 years to
get there from Four to Five.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:10%
My problem-- I didn't
know what my problem was.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.810 align:middle line:10%
I should have suspected,
'cause my issues have always

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:10%
been in the pride department.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:10%
And I finally hit the
Fifth one day, actually,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:10%
with a lot of students
who were here.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:10%
I was really sick and
had a workshop coming.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was so sick,
I couldn't go to it.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
I had to Livestream
that thing from home.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.596 align:middle line:84%
And my husband went
to the workshop,

00:08:30.596 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
and he calls me up at
the end the first day.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:90%
He goes, god, you look terrible.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.167 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
have a fever of 102.

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, we'll
put some makeup on.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, I got makeup on.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.436 align:middle line:90%
[QUIET LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So somewhere during
that workshop,

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:90%
some big thing happened.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.200 align:middle line:84%
I won't go into the details
with the student who's

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
now a teacher of mine
and is here in the room,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure, and a big deal.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I heard a voice
say to me, you are now

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:90%
of the order of Melchizedek.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that sounds
awesome, but I'm busy teaching.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll write that down, and
I'll read about it later.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.700 align:middle line:90%
So I read about it later.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And by then, I had reached
a point of humility.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't get my
mind blown by it.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:90%
But that is the Fifth Dimension.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:10%
On the Fifth Dimension you can
communicate telepathically,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.260 align:middle line:10%
read everybody's mind,
not always a good thing

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:10%
when they're reading how
fat you look [LAUGHS]

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:10%
or stuff like that.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.263 align:middle line:10%
And you can really
heal more profoundly.

00:09:32.263 --> 00:09:33.930 align:middle line:10%
The difference is,
you're just embodying

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:10%
more and more of the God Force.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So you're meant to be part
of the God Force, you see.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
It isn't separate from you.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:90%
You're actually part of it.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So every time you
move up a dimension

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
which is, as you can
see, a little hard to do.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me a lifetime
to just go up two.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But everything
speeds up, you know.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.952 align:middle line:84%
You guys will move a
lot quicker than me.

00:09:57.952 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed this
with my students.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:84%
They all moved way
faster than I did

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.520 align:middle line:90%
at everything which is normal.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.152 align:middle line:84%
So that's the Fifth Dimension--
something to look forward to.

00:10:07.152 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
the Sixth which is

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.190 align:middle line:10%
what I'm working on these days.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:10%
That's where you could
bilocate, teleport, levitate.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Seriously, there are people.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:10%
I could name them.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.150 align:middle line:10%
For example, Padre Pio, one
of my mentors, died in 1968.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:10%
Simple, modest, humble, Italian
monk, priest who could--

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:10%
he got the stigmata,
by the way--

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:10%
he could bilocate.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.960 align:middle line:84%
He'd been observed in two places
at once on numerous occasions.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And the guy was all about
love and compassion.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.002 align:middle line:84%
He didn't care if
you were-- it was

00:10:46.002 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
during the war-- he didn't care
if you were German or Japanese,

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:90%
or he didn't care.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.770 align:middle line:90%
You know, he helped everyone.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:90%
He was truly Sixth Dimension.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:90%
So was the man we call Jesus.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, whatever your religious
beliefs may be or not,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.430 align:middle line:84%
please bear with me because
I'm trans-religious.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I hope you are.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
That means that
when you're exposed

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to a good idea in a religion,
you take it and run and leave

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff you don't
like on the altar,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.920 align:middle line:84%
right, because you might
not agree with the dogma

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:90%
or who knows what.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean you can't
take some important history

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:90%
or culture or ritual.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I
mentioned Padre Pio.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Really, a stunning guy.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.150 align:middle line:90%
But back to the man Jesus.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So 2000 years ago, look at
the stuff he pulled off.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.910 align:middle line:90%
He could walk on water.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:90%
He could turn water into wine.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.518 align:middle line:90%
He could heal the crowd.

00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
When a woman came up
behind him and touched

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
his robe, the hem of his
robe without him knowing,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:84%
she was instantly healed
of a major blood disorder.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's what you
call Sixth Dimension.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:84%
So once you hit the
Sixth Dimension--

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
I know this doesn't sound like
fun-- but once you get there,

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:05.060 align:middle line:84%
you're actually free to leave
here and go to another plane

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.782 align:middle line:84%
where you become, because you're
of the order of Melchizedek.

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:84%
You remember, you
got that when you

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
were on the fifth dimension.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:90%
You

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Get to the Sixth then
you can leave here,

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and you become an
Ascended Master.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
So an Ascended Master has
mastered all Seven Rays.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:10%
Each ray has a leader--

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.880 align:middle line:10%
a Chohan.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:10%
The Seventh Ray actually has
two-- a man and a woman--

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:10%
who once lived here,
mastered all seven,

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:10%
have moved on to another
level, and now they're

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.380 align:middle line:10%
guiding us on our progress
on the Seventh Ray.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.570 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about initiations.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:90%
A lot you know I do initiations.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.670 align:middle line:84%
I've done them all my life, ever
since I hit the Fourth Level,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:90%
I should say.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I can help you move
up to the next level,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you want.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to do some
here in the room today.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get a chance
to work with me personally,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
here, just come see me
at the booth afterwards,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.380 align:middle line:90%
and I'll help you.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.940 align:middle line:84%
So it helps you get more
control over the rays.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.140 align:middle line:84%
So back to which ray
are you working on?

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at them
carefully, and you

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.700 align:middle line:10%
can apply this to yourself.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:10%
So the First Ray is all about
power, control, will, going out

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:10%
of yourself.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Could be a government position,
could be, as in Oprah's case,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.360 align:middle line:10%
a celebrity kind of a position.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:10%
But she's very
classic red going out

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:10%
where she's a good
example of someone who's

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:10%
actively working the Red Ray.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:10%
Other ideas may come to you.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You may think this
is you, by the way.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:90%
You might be working this ray.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you can do more
than once in a lifetime.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:90%
You can do more than one ray.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Maya Angelou is a great
example of the Blue Second Ray

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.700 align:middle line:10%
because she's all
about love and wisdom.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:10%
If you don't know
much about her,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:10%
she was born in poverty in the
depression in the deep south.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
When she was a teenager, she had
to do prostitution to survive.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.530 align:middle line:90%
Next thing you know--

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
think about her-- she's a
world-renowned writer, singer,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:90%
actress, poet, and activist.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:90%
She's a mentor for me.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what an
amazing gal, right?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.235 align:middle line:84%
Somebody who clearly mastered
this Blue Ray and maybe

00:14:32.235 --> 00:14:33.035 align:middle line:90%
some others.

00:14:33.035 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:90%
What about intelligence?

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, I thought of Bill Gates.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.725 align:middle line:90%
This is the Third Yellow Ray.

00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:44.100 align:middle line:84%
I thought he seemed like a
pretty good example of someone

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.070 align:middle line:84%
who's living predominantly
on this level,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.170 align:middle line:84%
at this moment, living on
this ray, working this ray.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just
intelligence, the Third Ray.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It's also the visual arts.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're a
photographer, a videographer,

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:90%
somebody who's in that realm.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg
might be great here.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.960 align:middle line:84%
This might be his ray,
right, in this lifetime.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:10%
The Green Fourth Ray is all
about harmony and beauty.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:10%
I selected Ellen.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to choose people
that not only fit the ray

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:10%
but people you know.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:10%
So you can say, oh,
yeah, I'm more like her.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:10%
By the way, dance
is part of this ray,

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:10%
and I thought, well,
that's Ellen, you know.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.820 align:middle line:10%
I think she's tired of
dancing from what I've read.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:10%
But she's really harmonious.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
She's not really
divisive, right?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:90%
She's kind of all about harmony.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's your Fourth Ray.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.860 align:middle line:10%
Your Fifth Ray is scientific
people, also medical people.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.530 align:middle line:10%
And I thought of Elon Musk.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.740 align:middle line:10%
He's the most scientificky
guy I could think of,

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.750 align:middle line:10%
and I think this is
very much his ray.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.630 align:middle line:10%
Then there's the Sixth
Ray-- devotion and idealism.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:10%
Martin Luther King is, I
thought, a good choice here.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:10%
It's also, the Sixth
Ray, often you'll

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.190 align:middle line:10%
find people who are active
in religious organizations.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's him, right?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.863 align:middle line:90%
So he's a fit there.

00:16:07.863 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:10%
And then here we are
at the Seventh Ray,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.900 align:middle line:10%
and I chose Malala.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:10%
You know her-- the
gal that almost got

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.580 align:middle line:10%
killed and then was so brave.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:10%
She's so young.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:10%
And, you know, she's taken
everybody on and saying,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:10%
you bet.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to stand up
for women being educated

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.230 align:middle line:10%
in-- where was it, Afghanistan?

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.030 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:10%
Pakistan, right.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:10%
So good for her.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:10%
She's really working
a Ray, isn't she?

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.340 align:middle line:84%
So you should all be
saying to yourselves, well,

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:84%
mine are one, three, and
two or one, four and seven.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, be thinking of
which Ray you're working on.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Chohans of this Seventh
Ray from which this Violet

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.910 align:middle line:10%
Flame meditation comes from that
we're going to do in a minute

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:10%
are literally brought
to us by two people

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.650 align:middle line:10%
who lived here and then died.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:10%
Can't tell you how
long ago because I

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:10%
don't have a feel for their--

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.810 align:middle line:10%
the information's
not been given to me

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:10%
which means it's probably
not intended for me to know.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:90%
But Lady Portia, she's called.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.069 align:middle line:90%
She's an Ascended Master.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.119 align:middle line:90%
She's a woman.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:90%
She's all about balance.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.480 align:middle line:90%
See, she's holding the scales.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:10%
This is an old, old,
old rendition of her.

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:22.579 align:middle line:10%
And she's also all
about intuition.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.640 align:middle line:10%
And her co-Cohan is St. Germain.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:10%
You probably have heard of him.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:10%
He, too, is an Ascended Master.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:10%
He's one of the most
well-known, and he's

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:10%
the one, along with Lady
Portia, they made a decision

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.790 align:middle line:10%
as human beings who
had departed here

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:10%
to help us out by
educating those of us who

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.680 align:middle line:10%
are attuned to this kind of
information on the Violet Flame

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:10%
and how it could help us.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
the Flame now.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:10%
So the Violet Flame
is a combination

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.400 align:middle line:10%
of the divine masculine
and the divine feminine

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.070 align:middle line:10%
which all of you have, right?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:10%
It's quite present
in all of you.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:10%
And it comes straight
from the Seventh Ray,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and it transmutes dark energy.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:10%
So I don't care if you're
dealing with shame, mistakes,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:10%
trauma, accidents, violence.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Something's happened, right?

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're over 25.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
Something for sure
has happened to you

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that is interfering with your
progress now, your progression.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And you don't want that.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You want to leap forward
into the next initiation,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.640 align:middle line:84%
master the next Ray, and
go to the next level,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
right, where you can do more
because you'll have more gifts

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to stimulate
you to really develop

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%
your special gifts.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So the flame itself is
created by the Holy Spirit.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not a word
that works for everybody.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So if that word is like
antithetical to your belief

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
system, just say to yourself
that Holy Spirit just

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.000 align:middle line:84%
means an energy that back
then, 2,000 years ago,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
people could sense when
it came in the room.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So remember the story, you know,
all the little pieces of flame.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the Violet Flame
that was descending, right,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and hit the heads of those
guys in the upper room.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
That's because their channel
between their pituitary

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and their pineal gland was
open, and it could sense source.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.053 align:middle line:90%
It could sense God in your body.

00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we'll be doing today

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.050 align:middle line:90%
is opening that channel.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.340 align:middle line:90%
So that you don't need a priest.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.380 align:middle line:90%
You can sense it yourself.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.248 align:middle line:84%
You'll know when
you sense divinity.

00:19:40.248 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all around you,
and you're part of it.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:90%
You're totally part of it.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You're so special,
you're so unique,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're so perfect
just the way you are.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Violet Flame will
help you see your perfection

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.010 align:middle line:84%
because then you'll stop
focusing on, uh, that divorce.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:90%
I screwed up.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
The deal with my mother before
she died, I ruined that.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.070 align:middle line:84%
You can get rid of all of
that trauma and self blame

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and regret and things that hold
you back from your wholeness,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
from really developing
yourself further.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Everything I teach
is vibrational.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.660 align:middle line:90%
I work with vibration.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:90%
I work with sound, mainly.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:10%
So the color violet has
the highest frequency

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.800 align:middle line:10%
of all the colors.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:10%
And the flame can
change your vibration.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:10%
So you're a
vibrating instrument.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I think Mary got you all
vibrating by singing.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.850 align:middle line:90%
You are an instrument.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Your body-mind is an
instrument of vibration.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And my job is to increase
your vibration by clearing out

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.130 align:middle line:84%
some dark material that's
stuck inside the atoms

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:90%
inside your body.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That's literally
where it's stuck.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And by increasing the
spin of those atoms,

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
they can throw off that
stuff you stored there,

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
and you're free of it.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It could be from past
lives, by the way.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
You may be freeing yourself
from something there.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we do the flame here
in a minute, picture colors--

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
they go all the way from this
orchid kind of real light pink

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:90%
all the way up to a deep purple.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.740 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.120 align:middle line:10%
The flame can be six feet
wide, nine feet tall.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:10%
You're going to be
sitting inside the flame.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:10%
It's not hot.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:10%
I know it's warm in here, but
the flame isn't hot at all.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:10%
And we will now meditate
on it for a minute, OK?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
stuff in your lap,

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.233 align:middle line:84%
you might want to
put it on the floor.

00:21:43.233 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:48.691 align:middle line:84%
We'll do this with
our eyes closed.

00:21:48.691 --> 00:21:51.457 align:middle line:90%
[AMBIENT MUSIC NOTES]

00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the level of
the room's a little high.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.430 align:middle line:84%
We were on the third
level while I was talking,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
so I'm just going
to use my energy,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to drop
you to a different level,

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
so you're no longer
in the mental body.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:19.777 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:21.645 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:22:21.645 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You guys should feel
a little different

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
now-- a little calmer,
a little more whole.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And just allow
yourself to relax.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.564 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.564 --> 00:22:34.415 align:middle line:84%
I'll take you through
the chakras first

00:22:34.415 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:90%
just so we're really centered.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We'll start with
our base chakra.

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.285 align:middle line:84%
It's red, it's pulsing, it's
at the base of your spine.

00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Just allow it to spin
and just know that it's

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
doing exactly what you want.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's widening right now
and connecting you more deeply

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.655 align:middle line:90%
to Mother Earth.

00:22:55.655 --> 00:22:56.455 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:22:56.455 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, we go to the second chakra.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.060 align:middle line:84%
It's in the center
of your lower belly.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:10%
It's orange.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:90%
It's balanced.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
It's just rotating ever
so nicely, cycling.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's recharging,
rebalancing, sending out

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.270 align:middle line:90%
the old bringing in the new.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, we go above our waist,
go to the third chakra.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Bright yellow color.

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.310 align:middle line:90%
[SLOW BREATHING]

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:90%
Recharge and rebalance.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.340 align:middle line:90%
That's your mental body.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.880 align:middle line:90%
It's your sense of self.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.295 align:middle line:90%
Now we go to the heart.

00:23:48.295 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:90%
It's green.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.933 align:middle line:90%
It's the bridge.

00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the bridge between your
lower chakras and your higher

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:90%
chakras.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And just intend for it
to expand ever so nicely,

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
just expanding outward from
you past your neighbor right

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:90%
out to the sides of room.

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:14.418 align:middle line:90%
Now to your throat chakra.

00:24:14.418 --> 00:24:15.834 align:middle line:90%
Cobalt blue.

00:24:15.834 --> 00:24:20.040 align:middle line:84%
It's where everything
you express

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.360 align:middle line:84%
from cooking to dancing
to riding to your work--

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:84%
everything comes
through your throat.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.739 align:middle line:90%
It's your place of expression.

00:24:28.739 --> 00:24:31.771 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:32.571 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:42.255 align:middle line:90%
Now to the third eye.

00:24:42.255 --> 00:24:43.728 align:middle line:90%
Just allow it to open.

00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:47.165 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.165 --> 00:24:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a violet color.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:59.577 align:middle line:84%
And right behind it, I'm taking
your focus to your pituitary

00:24:59.577 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and to your pineal gland.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's a channel
between the two--

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.220 align:middle line:90%
ancient channel.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not been used,
but let's open it now.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Just intend for it to open.

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.426 align:middle line:90%
Just intend for it to open.

00:25:20.426 --> 00:25:24.415 align:middle line:84%
And then through it, you sense
stability in your own body.

00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:27.568 align:middle line:90%


00:25:27.568 --> 00:25:30.436 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:25:30.436 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, we go to the
seventh chakra right

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.920 align:middle line:90%
at the top of your head.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.329 align:middle line:90%
[AMBIENT NOTES CONTINUE]

00:25:37.329 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful gold color.

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:49.504 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we intend
to go to the Seventh Ray.

00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.930 --> 00:26:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And go with me now as we go
to the temple in St. Germain.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Stay with me, very safe.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:90%
We're going to teleport there.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.947 align:middle line:84%
It's actually in
the United States.

00:26:06.947 --> 00:26:07.780 align:middle line:90%
It's in the Rockies.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:11.940 align:middle line:90%
It's under the ground.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:90%
We're at the door.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Just walk through
the entrance with me.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And you see an elevator
in front of you.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And we go deep, deep, deep
down into the mountain.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.715 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.715 --> 00:26:26.515 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:26:26.515 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And as you step out,
notice that everything is

a beautiful, beautiful color--

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.475 align:middle line:90%
a violet.

you're walking across,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:90%
the crystal floor, the walls.

00:26:44.013 --> 00:26:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And there's the flame.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And just step inside the flame.

it's below your feet.

[DEEP BREATHING]

it cleanses you and opens

Just allow the flame to
clear all the old trauma

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.025 align:middle line:90%
from the past lives, this life.

00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:43.850 align:middle line:90%

Just allow the flame to swirl
around you and go through you,

cleanse you.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:56.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And now, stepping
out of the flame

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.015 align:middle line:84%
and turning and walking back
with me, back to the elevator.

back to the entrance.

You can open your eyes.

Great.

All right.

Maybe your first experience

I'd love to initiate

>> Sophia.

Let's get a mic up
here for Sophia.

Tell me a little bit about
yourself and why you're here.

>> I don't know where to start.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.650 align:middle line:90%
My friend invited me.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was really
the right time for me.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Really welcoming
anything into my life

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.515 align:middle line:84%
right now that will put
me on the right path.

00:29:37.515 --> 00:29:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you're already
on the right path.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you meditate?

00:29:41.206 --> 00:29:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Not enough.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:90%
But, yes.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.330 align:middle line:90%
>> But you do.

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it in her thymus.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So you can't story to
me about your meditation

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:52.290 align:middle line:84%
because I can sense that
whether or not you have a base.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.693 align:middle line:84%
So you need to tighten up
your practice a little bit.

00:29:54.693 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But still you've got
something going on there.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:57.583 align:middle line:90%
Is it prayer, also?

00:29:57.583 --> 00:29:58.500 align:middle line:90%
You got a prayer base?

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Something's happening.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.010 align:middle line:84%
You're communicating
with spirit.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:90%


00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just feeling, and I'm
hearing that I have to--

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:90%
darn.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could do what I want,
but it doesn't work that way.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.620 align:middle line:84%
I have to listen
to her higher self,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'm being told to
clear something first

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in the second chakra, and then
give her a little bit of time.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm doing that.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:90%
And it's an old, old experience.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Does that ring a bell?

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.678 align:middle line:90%
>> And there it goes.

00:30:37.678 --> 00:30:38.720 align:middle line:90%
All right, give me a hug.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.936 align:middle line:90%
Great to meet you.

00:30:39.936 --> 00:30:40.736 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:40.736 --> 00:30:43.724 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:43.724 --> 00:30:48.598 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.598 --> 00:30:49.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll pick somebody in the back.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.630 align:middle line:90%


00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
How about the lady
with the two hands?

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.050 align:middle line:90%
Is that a lady or a man?

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that caught my eye.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, oh.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:90%
She beat you to it.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Hold on, here comes another
lady with two hands in the air.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it's all right.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.870 align:middle line:90%

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Amelia.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Amelia, how can I help you?

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I want to be initiated.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, you have to tell
me what's going on in your life.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.116 align:middle line:90%
I wish, huh?

00:31:22.116 --> 00:31:23.515 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a long story, but--

00:31:23.515 --> 00:31:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Let just interrupt
you for a second.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Hey, Eric, would you
grab my pendulum,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
unless somebody here in
the first row has one?

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing Mary has one.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.345 align:middle line:90%
OK, go ahead.

00:31:33.345 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been working on myself
for the last three years.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh good.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:90%
So everybody can hear you, huh?

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh?

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:44.550 align:middle line:84%
I've had a couple of
accidents and was told--

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.530 align:middle line:84%
couple of times I've had
cancer and I said no,

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.572 align:middle line:90%
and I don't, and I don't.

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Give her a big hand.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.448 align:middle line:90%
>> And I don't.

00:31:49.448 --> 00:31:52.376 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:52.376 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, careful down there.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.778 align:middle line:84%
So I like to use
these to demonstrate.

00:32:01.778 --> 00:32:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll stop for a minute and
just explain what I'm doing,

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and then I'll work
with you with this.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.440 align:middle line:84%
So a pendulum is nothing
more than an object

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that shows direction of energy
that maybe you can't perceive.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I like to use them to teach
chakra placement, location,

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.327 align:middle line:84%
and it's most helpful
to novices who

00:32:19.327 --> 00:32:21.160 align:middle line:84%
are trying to figure
out if they're anywhere

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.750 align:middle line:90%
near the darn chakra.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:84%
Because your friend is
saying, no, no, it's lower,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.555 align:middle line:90%
or it's up here, you know.

00:32:27.555 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:90%
You know how that is.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So back in the
day, these weren't

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.167 align:middle line:84%
used in when I was teaching
or when I was a student.

00:32:33.167 --> 00:32:35.083 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, well,
that's a big mistake

00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:90%
because they're great.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:40.120 align:middle line:84%
So I have, finally,
years ago, started

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
making my own so
that I could get

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:90%
them made out of beech wood.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.195 align:middle line:84%
If you want one of these, just
come on over to our booth.

00:32:45.195 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure we have some.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.480 align:middle line:90%
Because they're safe.

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Do not use crystals, please.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:52.780 align:middle line:84%
You can cut a chakra even in the
hands of a really experienced

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:53.890 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You want your chakras to be
even in size, pretty much.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't want a great big
one or a little tiny one.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.170 align:middle line:84%
You want them to
be going around--

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:90%
which direction?

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.100 align:middle line:90%
Clockwise.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
When they're going
the other way,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:84%
they're sending a message
out to the universe that

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.640 align:middle line:84%
says a message like if your
heart chakra's going backwards,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.270 align:middle line:84%
it's sending out a message
that says, I'm not lovable.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you'll get, of course.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So you understand, we're
creating our own reality

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.990 align:middle line:90%
every single second, right?

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.620 align:middle line:84%
We're sending messages
out from our chakras which

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
are nothing more than vortices
of energy that predominate

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.800 align:middle line:90%
in your bubble of energy.

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
So you're sitting in
a bubble of energy,

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's got these,
like, special spots where

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.660 align:middle line:90%
the vortex is more active.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's either
cleared or not based on

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.290 align:middle line:84%
whether or not you're
harboring emotions.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you take an
emotion like you

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
were taught by your parents
and your school and whatnot,

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and you go, I'm not
going to feel that.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go to the
funeral on Saturday

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.430 align:middle line:84%
and go right back to work
on Monday because that's

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.330 align:middle line:90%
what everybody wants.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have time to grieve,
so I'll just shove it down.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.270 align:middle line:84%
You'll probably stop
your heart chakra.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
It'll just stop in
its tracks 'cause

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.550 align:middle line:84%
it can't manage that kind
of oppressive emotion of not

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:90%
feeling.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:90%
It needs to feel.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is a great tool
with you and a friend

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.290 align:middle line:84%
can check whether or not your
chakras are working optimally.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Don't get, you know,
like reliant on it.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Consider it like
training wheels.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's kind
of a temporary thing.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.280 align:middle line:84%
So you mind if I do a
little demonstration?

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's about
where your base is.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:45.820 align:middle line:90%
So look how good her base is.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Let me turn you
square to the room.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:90%
Turn this way.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:54.590 align:middle line:84%
So you stole it with
your other hand.

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:57.020 align:middle line:84%
You use a hand that you
would pet a dog with.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.845 align:middle line:90%
Notice how strong her base is.

00:34:58.845 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
can see back there,

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's definitely clockwise,
and it's huge, right, OK?

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But my guess is her second's
probably not as happy.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Just guessing here.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little and
going backwards, right?

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.790 align:middle line:90%
It's going counter.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to see
from a distance,

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and my hand might
be shaking a bit,

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.970 align:middle line:84%
but, you know, I can tell you
this is what's going on here.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Her third, sense of self feels
a little diminished to me.

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:35.193 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.193 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a real
scientific term

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:37.985 align:middle line:84%
for what you're
seeing right now.

00:35:37.985 --> 00:35:40.102 align:middle line:90%
It's called dead in the water.

00:35:40.102 --> 00:35:41.500 align:middle line:90%
[QUIET LAUGHTER]

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:84%
That little bit of
movement's coming

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:90%
from the air conditioning.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's not going to happen.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:90%
OK, and then we go to four.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Notice I've got about, what,
a couple three inches, maybe.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.940 align:middle line:90%
And let's have you be seated.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I can get a chair.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.180 align:middle line:84%
So I know I can't
reach my arm that high

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.410 align:middle line:90%
and get anything valid.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.570 align:middle line:90%
My arm will start to shake.

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, just stay here Linda.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.360 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, 'cause we'll
take it down in a sec.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:20.052 align:middle line:90%
So we were at four, right?

00:36:20.052 --> 00:36:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, you'd probably
write them down, you know,

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're hard
to memorize at first.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:29.060 align:middle line:90%
And here's her heart.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.230 align:middle line:90%
That's not happy either.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:84%
It's also-- it's trying to go
counter, but it's really still,

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.918 align:middle line:90%
I would say still.

00:36:38.918 --> 00:36:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're at her throat.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.335 align:middle line:84%
Would you mind
closing your eyes?

00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Your subject can distort the
movement by intending to.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So the main teaching thing about
this I urge you to remember

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
your energy field.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You can distort the
movement-- the handler.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.030 align:middle line:84%
There is the subject's
energy field.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
If they try, they can
distort the movement.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:90%
It's intentionality.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.378 align:middle line:84%
And this thing has its
own energy field, right?

00:37:05.378 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's three energy
fields all-- and so

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.093 align:middle line:84%
it's really fascinating when
you start to work with it.

00:37:10.093 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Where were we, throat?

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.400 align:middle line:10%
Nope.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.200 align:middle line:10%
Straight line.

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.310 align:middle line:10%
See how it's going
back and forth

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.790 align:middle line:10%
but not going
around in a circle?

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a chakra that is
trying to change direction.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called straight line.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.185 align:middle line:84%
It means, like, which
way am I wanting to go?

00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:33.990 align:middle line:10%
It's going to go some direction
maybe in the next day.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.923 align:middle line:10%
I've got my field
pulled way back, like,

00:37:36.923 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:10%
way back over there
where that guitar is

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.540 align:middle line:10%
so I won't accidentally
straighten them,

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.460 align:middle line:10%
so I don't accidentally
correct them.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.973 align:middle line:90%


00:37:48.973 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Are we with the sixth?

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.120 align:middle line:10%
We are, aren't we?

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:10%
It's closed.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And so is seven.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.370 align:middle line:10%
So she had one open.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.973 align:middle line:10%
She had her base
chakra open which

00:37:58.973 --> 00:38:00.390 align:middle line:10%
is really important
because that's

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:04.300 align:middle line:10%
where you get your health from.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.400 align:middle line:90%
That's where you get--

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.550 align:middle line:84%
you heard her say, she
beat cancer a couple times.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.370 align:middle line:84%
That's Mother Earth coming
up through her souls

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and healing her body 'cause
she's got her base chakra open.

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly important.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:21.090 align:middle line:84%
You gotta keep that sucker
open all the time if you can.

00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:24.300 align:middle line:10%
Best ways to open it--
walking barefoot on the grass,

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.030 align:middle line:10%
putting your back
up against a tree.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:84%
In the wintertime, maybe doing
yoga or Pilates or something

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.250 align:middle line:90%
with your body.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Outside, though, is really the
ticket for your base chakra.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:10%
Your base chakra is your
connection to the earth,

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:10%
so the more time you can
spend outside the better.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:43.800 align:middle line:90%
So why don't you stand up.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.580 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
leave you like this.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Here, I'll just
straighten you out.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Hold still.

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:90%


00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.570 align:middle line:90%
OK, you want to see that?

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, don't try this at home.

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:90%
So turn around, and I'll just--

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.507 align:middle line:84%
so we won't look at one
again, right, because one--

00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if all of her
chakras were that big.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.670 align:middle line:90%
You saw how big that thing was?

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.670 align:middle line:90%
That was big.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, well, let's look again.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Here, let's give her some.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:90%
There's one.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, see, it's resized itself.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a little better.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.895 align:middle line:90%
OK, and now we'll go to two.

00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:27.790 align:middle line:90%


00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:29.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's two.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.810 align:middle line:90%
It's got an ellipse.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's going in the
right direction,

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:33.570 align:middle line:90%
but has a little wing to it.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:90%
That's like an ellipse.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.662 align:middle line:84%
That means that it's on
its way to recovering.

00:39:38.662 --> 00:39:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.705 align:middle line:90%
There's there.

00:39:43.705 --> 00:39:45.635 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:45.635 --> 00:39:46.435 align:middle line:90%
Here's four.

00:39:46.435 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Sit down, and we'll do
the last three here--

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:90%
five, six, and seven.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Key point's number five.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:90%
See how small it is?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
It's going the right way,
but it's really small.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.380 align:middle line:84%
That tells me that
that's key point.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:09.720 align:middle line:84%
If I were going to work
with her extensively,

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably zero
in on her throat.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.610 align:middle line:90%


00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Six is normal.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.170 align:middle line:90%
Seven's normal.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Cool, now, ask me
how I did that.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Give me a hug.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.640 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.522 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:40:33.522 --> 00:40:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's just pull it
off to the side.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Thanks very much, Linda.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.370 align:middle line:90%
So aren't these fun?

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.920 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.493 align:middle line:90%
I have instructions.

00:40:42.493 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Mine come with
instructions so you don't

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:90%
have to write this stuff down.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But I found them to be just a
super teaching tool and fun,

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:51.960 align:middle line:90%
you know, at-home tool.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Don't do it with your spouse,
your significant other.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Nix that idea because
pretty soon it's,

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.165 align:middle line:84%
I told you your third
chakra was, you know.

00:41:00.165 --> 00:41:01.620 align:middle line:90%
Uh, huh, uh, huh.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.470 align:middle line:90%
So skip that, OK?

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.490 align:middle line:90%
Another volunteer.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.871 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.871 --> 00:41:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I was the
original two-hander.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.450 align:middle line:90%
The original two-hander.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.625 align:middle line:90%
Here she comes.

00:41:14.625 --> 00:41:15.750 align:middle line:90%
Hi, what's your first name?

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:16.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Stephanie.

00:41:16.385 --> 00:41:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Stephanie.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.897 align:middle line:84%
Here, let me just
throw this to the back

00:41:18.897 --> 00:41:20.935 align:middle line:84%
so I don't accidentally
read her jewelry.

00:41:20.935 --> 00:41:21.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's your past.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.630 align:middle line:90%
That won't bother me.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:24.860 align:middle line:90%
OK, uh-huh.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So I have a--

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.993 align:middle line:90%
>> A little higher with the mic.

00:41:26.993 --> 00:41:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> --a lot of jaw issue
going on right here.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I work a lot with highers.

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> You work with what?

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Higher-ons,
channeling, angels.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Bringing a lot of frequency.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So I find that it tends to
blow out the suit a little bit.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
You're a little bit closed
from the throat down.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I just went on a
massive radio show two days

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.390 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And that made you
leave your body.

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You've come up
out of your base,

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and you went out the
top of your head,

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're somewhere up on,
I don't know, Sirius, maybe.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.040 align:middle line:84%
If I can, I'd just like to bring
you down where you're safe.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.380 align:middle line:84%
You aren't safe when
you leave your body.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.330 align:middle line:90%
So remember that.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:90%
You're not safe.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, as children,
so many of us

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:20.820 align:middle line:84%
did that 'cause things
were so awful here.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.362 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, that's OK for
a three-year-old but not safe

00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:24.162 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So if I can just--

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Should I put this down?

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.525 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't need to.

00:42:26.525 --> 00:42:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I just already pulled you
back in just by intending it.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.050 align:middle line:90%
All right, thank you so much.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, be careful, be careful.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about that
for-- oh, you're next.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:37.740 align:middle line:90%
Right there, that lady.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, in the purple.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, come on up.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.550 align:middle line:84%
No, this lady right
here in the second row.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.882 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:42.882 --> 00:42:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Just talk about that for a
minute-- leaving your body

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:90%
and how unsafe that is.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:51.600 align:middle line:84%
So I mastered that technique
as a small child-- as an infant

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:56.490 align:middle line:84%
because my mother didn't
want another baby,

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
so she tried abortion
and it didn't work.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And so that was kind
of a chilling incident,

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:90%
you know, for a fetus.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a lot of
sexual aggression in my home.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.212 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, I just
never stayed in my body.

00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't find out
how unsafe that was

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.700 align:middle line:90%
so I woke up with cancer at 25.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So let me encourage you--
really stay in your body.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.240 align:middle line:90%
Stay in your body.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Do things like what we just
discussed-- trees, grass,

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.800 align:middle line:90%
things that make you feel safe.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Really try.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.050 align:middle line:90%
Come on up.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.875 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

00:43:33.875 --> 00:43:34.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Corinne.

00:43:34.675 --> 00:43:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Corinne.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.472 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, turn that way,
and let me look at you.

00:43:37.472 --> 00:43:38.930 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm looking
at someone, I'm

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:43.120 align:middle line:84%
looking to see if there's a
lean back from an external vibe,

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.030 align:middle line:90%
an external force.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't see one here.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Is that just your
past, or is that a gem?

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a gem.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you move it?

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.138 align:middle line:84%
Because that'll interfere
with my read of her thymus.

00:43:52.138 --> 00:43:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm definitely
getting something here.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Something.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm going to
get a couple students.

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.350 align:middle line:90%
Eric, will you back me up?

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It's my husband Eric.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:16.542 align:middle line:84%
Give him a big hand because
he's very trained himself.

00:44:16.542 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:84%
He's been putting up with these
shenanigans for a lifetime.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.190 align:middle line:90%
I need a couple of students.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Linda, and where's Kathy?

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I need another student.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Show your hands, students.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:36.042 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Mindy, please.

00:44:36.042 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Come on on the other side of me.

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Here, let's take
this away from her.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:40.867 align:middle line:90%
Stick it on the table.

00:44:40.867 --> 00:44:44.498 align:middle line:90%


00:44:44.498 --> 00:44:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to have
to go and push a little bit.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:52.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.630 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of tension.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:55.610 align:middle line:90%
You meditate?

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I did today.

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> You did.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's not bad.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.540 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.840 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.840 align:middle line:90%
[SINGING MUSICAL TONE]

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:18.340 align:middle line:90%


00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.840 align:middle line:90%
Good, good for you.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Big hug.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Pardon me?

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:28.970 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:29.850 align:middle line:90%
I will.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.982 align:middle line:90%
So that was an initiation.

00:45:31.982 --> 00:45:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.330 align:middle line:90%


00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'll tell you
when they started.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.750 align:middle line:84%
I was young, and I had just
hit the Fourth Dimension

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and didn't know it,
OK, didn't know it.

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I was very innocent
of the whole thing.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And I went in for a
chiropractic visit

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to a new chiropractor
who had me face up,

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.263 align:middle line:84%
seemed like a
really nice guy, you

00:45:56.263 --> 00:45:58.430 align:middle line:84%
know, standard, classic,
on-the-table, face-up thing

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.230 align:middle line:84%
when all of a sudden, he's
above me, and all of a sudden,

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I went, (SINGING) ahh,
to his face, you know.

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.395 align:middle line:90%
And he goes-- (SINGING) ahh.

00:46:09.395 --> 00:46:11.570 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:90%
I was so embarrassed.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:14.960 align:middle line:84%
God, I could've crawled
out of his office.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.110 align:middle line:90%
We never spoke of it.

00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I never went back.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And then it started
happening all over town,

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.450 align:middle line:84%
you know, with
other practitioners.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And they were always really into
it 'cause they could feel it.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.260 align:middle line:84%
They were ready, you see,
and somehow, I knew that.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And like any other
skill, like riding

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.130 align:middle line:84%
a bike or skiing or
anything, I got better at it.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.953 align:middle line:84%
And I've done
thousands of them now.

00:46:38.953 --> 00:46:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I hit the
Fifth Dimension

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I was able to initiate people
to a much higher level which

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.260 align:middle line:90%
was way more fun.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.610 align:middle line:90%
We might see one of those today.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Just intended.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.320 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.130 align:middle line:90%
You never know.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So that was an initiation
that you just saw.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.770 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
take very long.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm type A, so I speed
them way up to suit me.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And spirit does that with you.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Spirit takes your
idiosyncrasies and uses them.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:13.820 align:middle line:90%
You came this way for a reason.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So you're that special person
with those special kind

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.170 align:middle line:90%
of quirky things.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Don't hide them or kill them.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.148 align:middle line:90%
They're there for a reason.

00:47:21.148 --> 00:47:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And the older you get,
the more comfortable

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.890 align:middle line:84%
you'll get with being
who you really are,

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.682 align:middle line:84%
and you'll just start
to show these things.

00:47:26.682 --> 00:47:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And your gifts, they
don't fly out of the sky

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and hit you in the head.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.760 align:middle line:90%
They sort of develop naturally.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't realize that you've
suddenly hit another dimension.

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:84%
No one's going to,
like, send you a notice.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But you'll look back
over a year or two,

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and you'll go,
when did I start--

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.530 align:middle line:84%
fill in the blank--
public speaking or writing

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:51.290 align:middle line:84%
books or achieving
scientific goals

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
or hitting the
new level in dance

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:57.530 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is for you,
whatever your gift is,

00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.000 align:middle line:90%
whatever your gift might be?

00:47:59.000 --> 00:47:59.900 align:middle line:90%
We got somebody else?

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:04.005 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.005 --> 00:48:05.630 align:middle line:84%
How about this guy
right here in black.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.995 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:48:15.995 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:90%
Hi, what's your first name?

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Raul.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Raul, very nice to meet you.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at them.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Tell us why you're here--

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.280 align:middle line:90%
here for the weekend.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Feels right.

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Feels right.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:29.820 align:middle line:90%
You meditate?

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:31.540 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.830 align:middle line:90%
Long time?

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:middle line:90%
>> A little while?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:34.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, Linda, let's
hand that off to you.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:56.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm getting--
it's different.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.645 align:middle line:90%
There's a guide here.

00:49:02.645 --> 00:49:04.520 align:middle line:84%
Is there someone in
particular you work with?

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not recognizing
it's a male figure.

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.374 align:middle line:90%
>> Babaji?

00:49:09.374 --> 00:49:11.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Could be.

00:49:11.932 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:90%
What's your background?

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:13.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Indian.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but Hindu.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Or Hindu, yeah.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Older-- it's a older figure than
that, more years before him.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm on that level
right now, so I'm not

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.890 align:middle line:90%
real articulate on this level.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:34.435 align:middle line:84%
And since my job is to
bring him in for Raul.

00:49:34.435 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:90%


00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.810 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who are clairvoyant
may be able to see him.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.730 align:middle line:90%
He's standing here.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's got kind of
ancient Indian garb--

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:52.070 align:middle line:90%
East Indian garb.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Like the time of
the Vedas, maybe,

00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:59.771 align:middle line:90%
3,000 or 4,000 years ago.

00:49:59.771 --> 00:50:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And he's ancestral to you.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.190 align:middle line:90%
He's in your family tree.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.263 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:50:06.263 --> 00:50:08.580 align:middle line:90%
There he is.

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.080 align:middle line:90%
I need you seated in a chair.

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Come on up, Linda.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:16.250 align:middle line:84%
He wants to-- yeah, a
low chair like that.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:19.730 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.130 align:middle line:90%
He's asking me to do this.

00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:23.230 align:middle line:90%
You'll see why.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:28.426 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be a teacher.

00:50:28.426 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, that's really strong.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I need a couple backup.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I could get you guys
to come back up--

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:37.425 align:middle line:90%
Mindy and Eric.

00:50:37.425 --> 00:50:41.480 align:middle line:84%
It's really strong,
strong, strong energy.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So the guide's energy
comes through me.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:45.920 align:middle line:90%
You fill it?

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.003 align:middle line:90%
It's strong, huh?

00:50:47.003 --> 00:50:50.867 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.867 --> 00:50:52.800 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And you will teach.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.290 align:middle line:90%
You will lead.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:51:01.563 align:middle line:90%


00:51:01.563 --> 00:51:02.730 align:middle line:90%
And if I can have you stand.

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:05.680 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:07.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to move
it right into here.

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:14.705 align:middle line:90%


00:51:14.705 --> 00:51:15.675 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

00:51:15.675 --> 00:51:23.460 align:middle line:90%


00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.860 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Good luck with that.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:34.050 align:middle line:90%


00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:36.103 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I've given
information about your path

00:51:36.103 --> 00:51:38.520 align:middle line:84%
or what you're going to do
next or how that'll change you,

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.490 align:middle line:84%

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.400 align:middle line:90%

All right, because it's
a good teaching moment.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, it's a
real backward lean,

00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.293 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, it's
simply something

00:56:50.293 --> 00:56:51.460 align:middle line:90%
you're seeing clairvoyantly.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:52.835 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not big
on clairvoyance.

00:56:52.835 --> 00:56:55.540 align:middle line:90%
I prefer you feel with your gut.

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.180 align:middle line:84%
You'll get much better
information from here

00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:90%
than from here.

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:02.500 align:middle line:84%
This, unless you're trained,
and you're not an ego,

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.380 align:middle line:84%
can really distort what
you think you're seeing.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So don't get too hung up,
and be careful about people

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.340 align:middle line:84%
who claim they are
very clairvoyant,

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.715 align:middle line:84%
and they can see everything
about you-- blah, blah, blah.

00:57:11.715 --> 00:57:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Be really cautious about that
because what you feel down here

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:18.560 align:middle line:84%
is much more accurate and
more likely to be true.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.290 align:middle line:84%
You can trust what
your gut says.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:23.980 align:middle line:84%
So here, I could be sensing
that backward lean, although I

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.880 align:middle line:84%
think it's physically
visible, isn't it?

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.740 align:middle line:84%

00:59:22.188 --> 00:59:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't get a
chance up here, don't panic.

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Come see me by the--

00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:31.130 align:middle line:84%
10 minutes after we close today,
I'll be over a booth 200 happy

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.860 align:middle line:90%
to work with you there.

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:35.180 align:middle line:90%
This is my life work.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.380 align:middle line:90%
I really do enjoy doing it.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.480 align:middle line:90%
What's your first name?

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:40.100 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Christianne Shire.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Uh-huh And how can I
help you, Christianne?

00:59:43.515 --> 00:59:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had issues with
some autoimmune and viruses

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.350 align:middle line:90%

>> Let's just get all that
stuff to the back so I don't--

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:52.937 align:middle line:90%
just the past month?

00:59:52.937 --> 00:59:54.270 align:middle line:90%
How do you know it's autoimmune?

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I've contracted a
virus in my system a few years

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:01.495 align:middle line:84%
back, but then also, I've been
having a ton of womb issues.

01:00:01.495 --> 01:00:06.016 align:middle line:84%
>> And this has all been
verified by Western medicine.

01:00:06.016 --> 01:00:09.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and I did a detox.

01:00:09.345 --> 01:00:10.145 align:middle line:90%
I did a detox.

01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that yours?

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's adorable.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.362 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Tiny Dancer.

01:00:17.362 --> 01:00:18.720 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here let me
turn you sideways.

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Turn, turn.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.265 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a detox about
a month ago that--

01:00:25.265 --> 01:00:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You can see the energy here.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.970 align:middle line:90%
You guys see it?

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So she's got reason
to want to detox.

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:35.740 align:middle line:90%
She's very attuned, very aware.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a really good thing, OK?

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.515 align:middle line:84%
So she already knows she's
got something going on there.

01:00:39.515 --> 01:00:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've been trying to
clear my womb but not just

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that.

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%
Candida in the intestines.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:45.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
No, I can sense it.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I can feel it, yeah.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's coming from
up here somewhere.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Look at the audience
so they can see.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:53.060 align:middle line:90%
See, it's in her eyes.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
So you can really see almost
everything in the eyes.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And just tracking, trying
to decide where to grab it.

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:05.700 align:middle line:90%


01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's showing here.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
It's 2 and 5 which is
so classic with women--

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
2 and 5, 2 and 5--
but for some reason,

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:14.980 align:middle line:90%
it's more pronounced here.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll figure out why.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.060 align:middle line:90%


01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.238 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:01:20.238 --> 01:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
grab it, all right?

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:27.800 align:middle line:90%


01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.670 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:29.050 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I don't want
to do too much on you

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.582 align:middle line:90%
because you're pretty--

01:01:31.582 --> 01:01:32.600 align:middle line:90%
pretty-- here, give me a hug.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600 align:middle line:90%
You're pretty sensitive.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.346 align:middle line:90%
Nice to have you.

Lets everybody
stand and join hands

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.550 align:middle line:84%
across the aisle because
we're all unified

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%
now in a state of, really, joy.

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:52.780 align:middle line:90%
This is joy.
