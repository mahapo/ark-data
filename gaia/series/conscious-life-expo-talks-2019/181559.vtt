00:00:02.988 --> 00:00:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Put your hands together
and give a warm, wonderful,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.100 align:middle line:84%
conscious life welcome
to Maureen St. Germain.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> How about a hug?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that great intro.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.970 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all for getting
up early to get your breakfast

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and make sure you were here.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:10%
It's always tricky when you're
the first or second person

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.229 align:middle line:10%
on the agenda.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.390 align:middle line:90%
And I know how tricky it is.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for
making an effort.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:10%
I'd also like to hold your heart
open and think of a little one

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.260 align:middle line:10%
that you have held
in your arms in love.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.465 align:middle line:10%
And see yourself imagining that
you're sending a beam of love

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:10%
and light up your pranic tube
directly to your heart chakra

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.350 align:middle line:10%
as it starts out as, then your
throat chakra, Third Eye, crown

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.370 align:middle line:10%
chakra, and all the way up
to your higher self, which

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.630 align:middle line:10%
is at your eighth chakra.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the portal
to your higher self.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And see that energy
come down and show you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
with unconditional
love and light.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking for
a day of heaven

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
on Earth for each
and every one of us

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and everyone we come
in contact with.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, I also started to
go a little verklempt.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:10%
And I was worried
about my eye makeup.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:10%
But I wanted to also
give a little shout out

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:10%
to a very good friend of mine,
one of my early students, who

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.690 align:middle line:10%
threw in with a bunch of friends
without knowing who I was

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:10%
or what she was going to
learn to attend to workshop.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:10%
And she just happened to be
in LA for a job interview

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:10%
this weekend and texted me last
night and said, are you in LA?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.420 align:middle line:10%
I think I saw you on the
beach in Santa Monica.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, I'm not at
the beach, but I am in LA.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And I invited her
to come over here.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.110 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for
making the effort.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.610 align:middle line:90%
So she came in from New York.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:90%
How do you like that?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.280 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:10%
So today, I'm going to
be talking about tools

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.970 align:middle line:10%
that you won't find in my book.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:10%
So if you have read
my book, and you're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:10%
using everything I'm giving you
in the book, this is new stuff.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.370 align:middle line:10%
And I deliberately
went out of my way

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.533 align:middle line:10%
to try and come up with new
things that you could use.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:10%
So I'm called a practical
mystic for a reason.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:10%
And that's because I like
things to be very practical.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:10%
Having been the
mother of four sons

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:10%
and working in the corporate
world for close to 30 years,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:10%
I didn't always have the
time I wanted to spend

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:10%
on the things I wanted to do.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.440 align:middle line:10%
So the way I did that is
I came up with shortcuts.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I'm all about.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:10%
My books have been translated
into five languages now.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And I teach quite
a bit in China.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And my books are in Chinese
and in German and Russian,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:90%
a Swiss language.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.772 align:middle line:84%
We haven't figured
out what it is yet.

00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I saw the copy, but I don't
know what language it is.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all over
the USA and Canada.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:10%
And I had the good fortune of
having the retailers New Age

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:10%
Things vote my book
their best selling book.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.750 align:middle line:10%
And it was a write-in
vote because it was just

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:10%
a random thing.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.717 align:middle line:10%
Tell us what's selling well.

00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:35.185 align:middle line:10%
And that's what they wrote in.

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:10%
So I'm very grateful.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:10%
And it wouldn't
happen without you.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.300 align:middle line:10%
So if you have the
book, thank you.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.100 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for reading
it, sharing it,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.533 align:middle line:10%
and learning from it, because
that's what I'm all about.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:49.753 align:middle line:10%
And without you, I don't
have a job, so thank you.

00:03:49.753 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
jump right in, and I'm

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about polarity.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.400 align:middle line:10%
Polarity is something
that we are very familiar

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:10%
with in terms of
how we look at life,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:10%
up and down, left and right.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.520 align:middle line:10%
One of my sons, when he was,
I don't know, maybe five

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:10%
was tested because
he was super smart,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.840 align:middle line:10%
and he was reading already.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.755 align:middle line:84%
And they took him
into a little room.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
overhear in the room.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.740 align:middle line:10%
And the tester said,
so the floor is down,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.720 align:middle line:10%
that means the ceiling is up.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:10%
So if lemons are
sour, sugar is--

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:10%
bad for you.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.590 align:middle line:10%
That's when you know
they're listening.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:10%
So polarity can be
used to help you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:10%
if you know what you're doing.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:10%
And part of what I
believe in is to help

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:10%
you understand that
polarity is part of a game

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:10%
that we are leaving behind.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.760 align:middle line:10%
So if you are wedded to
the game of polarity,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.550 align:middle line:10%
you won't be able to shift.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.440 align:middle line:10%
But if you recognize,
wait a minute,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:10%
it's a little bit like everybody
was switching from NFL football

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:10%
to soccer.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:10%
And the players no longer
have to use heavy equipment

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:10%
to protect themselves.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a gentleman's game.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:10%
The rules are different.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:10%
The ball is different, but
they're still using a goal.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:10%
And they still call it football.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.268 align:middle line:10%
So you'd have to shift.

00:05:11.268 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I'm
asking you to do.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:10%
Because when you do that,
you are given the chance

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:10%
to be your 5D self.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:10%
And surprise, surprise--
getting to be 5D

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:10%
isn't going to be
an overnight thing.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:10%
It's a gradual thing.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.100 align:middle line:10%
And like my mother said to me
one time about one of my sons,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.518 align:middle line:10%
children don't grow
up in a straight line.

00:05:34.518 --> 00:05:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And I know you're
really proud of him

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
for what he has
just accomplished,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
but usually when they do
something very mature,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:84%
they follow it was
something really stupid.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's us.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:90%
That's us.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.000 align:middle line:10%
So we're sliding into 5D,
and we're sliding back.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:10%
And even I didn't know it.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.432 align:middle line:10%
I have discovered these things.

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:10%
And I will share that with you.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
that's very interesting

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:10%
that there is no answer for,
and it's just a conundrum.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:10%
And that is that the
electromagnetic waves

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:10%
have two qualities to it.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.227 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if I can get
this pointer to work.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.237 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if
it'll shine on this.

00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Probably not.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:10%
OK, so as you look at the red
hills and valleys, you'll see,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.110 align:middle line:10%
if you get the 3D
visual, you will

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:10%
see that it is 90 degrees
different from the magnetic

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:10%
field, which I think is blue.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is that magnetic
and electric work together

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:10%
to give us power.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:10%
And it is an irresistible
and opposing force

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:90%
So it pulls and pushes.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And according to my
scientist spouse,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.870 align:middle line:84%
there is no
explanation for this.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:90%
It's just what it is.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.420 align:middle line:90%
What's that all about?

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:10%
OK, so what do we do for all
these waves and energies that

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.510 align:middle line:10%
are around us?

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is when you
know about something you can

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:10%
create it in your mind's eye.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:10%
On your mind knows no
difference between what

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.160 align:middle line:10%
is tangible and real in front of
you and what you're imagining.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.993 align:middle line:10%
So you may as well use
it to your advantage.

00:07:15.993 --> 00:07:17.535 align:middle line:10%
Now, a Faraday cage--
how many of you

00:07:17.535 --> 00:07:18.945 align:middle line:10%
know what a Faraday cage is?

00:07:18.945 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:10%
Oh, good, most of you.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:10%
So I'll just do a
quick explanation.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:10%
A man by the name of
Faraday invented a way

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:10%
to make electromagnetic
waves, EMF,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of electrical
energy impenetrable.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:10%
And it's a metal cage
that's constructed in a way

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:10%
that their waves
can't get through it.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:10%
So when you're in
a Faraday cage,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:10%
your cell phone won't work.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:10%
And you won't be hit with
electromagnetic waves, which

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.730 align:middle line:10%
are very hard on our bodies.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:10%
So at night, when I go
to bed, I say a prayer.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:10%
And the prayer is in the book.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.680 align:middle line:10%
And part of the
prayer is I am calling

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:07.180 align:middle line:10%
in an electronic Faraday cage
around my body for the next 24

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.202 align:middle line:10%
hours and around
my bed so that I'm

00:08:09.202 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:10%
sleeping undisturbed
and unaffected

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:10%
by any energies that are
inappropriate for human life.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And you can too.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
that's very interesting

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:10%
about the current way
we think about things

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:10%
is we work with what's
called the scientific method.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:10%
And we start with a
collection of data,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:10%
which then we create a
hypothesis on what we think

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.380 align:middle line:10%
has happened.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And we experiment and
look at the results.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:10%
And we're constantly
trying to disprove it

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:10%
because a scientific
proof exists

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:10%
because we've had every
opportunity to disprove

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.720 align:middle line:10%
it and have failed.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:10%
So it's a little bit backwards
to what you think it might be.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:10%
So what is the
difference between all

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.360 align:middle line:10%
the data that we're collecting
and the information you have?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:10%
And that is start
asking questions.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Start asking questions.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:10%
So when something
happens that does not

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:10%
match the way you're used
to thinking about the world,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.660 align:middle line:10%
consider that you could say
I wonder what's going on,

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:10%
or what is this,
rather than, oh,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:10%
that's just blah, blah, blah.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:10%
And you dismiss it
and forget about it.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
people often dismiss

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:10%
is the solution to
what is going on.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:10%
And if you already
know the solution,

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.910 align:middle line:10%
you will miss what interesting
thing might also be happening.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:10%
So when something happens that
defies your normal expectation,

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:10%
ask yourself, I wonder
what's going on,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:10%
instead of oh, I
missed that turn again.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm always lost.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:55.580 align:middle line:10%
Or oh, the phone
always rings whenever

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm trying to concentrate.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And instead say, I
wonder what's going on.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And allow the universe to
teach you something new.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:10%
Because the game has changed.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.870 align:middle line:10%
And the rules are
different in the new game.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's so different that my
guides gave me the information

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.842 align:middle line:10%
that it's a brand new game.

00:10:14.842 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:10%
And there's a reason why
it's a brand new game.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:10%
Because in 3D we have polarity.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And we understand the world
between light and dark,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.790 align:middle line:90%
good and evil, up and down.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And in 5D, many more
possibilities are available.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
But they're all god choices,
not god choice doesn't exist.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:10%
So imagine a child going outside
and playing in a mud puddle.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.200 align:middle line:90%
You're with them.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.517 align:middle line:90%
And they're playing.

00:10:46.517 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And after they're done playing,
and after the rain and the mud

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
puddle, they go in
and have a bath.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Clean clothes are put on.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
The dirty clothes
are in the wash.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:90%
That's us.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:84%
We've been allowed to play
in the not god choices.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And we're now choosing to move
into a place of god choice.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.060 align:middle line:10%
So we'll use polarity.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
ways you do that is

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:10%
to choose words that are less
powerful in the polarity realm

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and more powerful in
the non-polarity room.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:90%
I hope you can see this.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:10%
I can barely see it.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.110 align:middle line:10%
I should have used
a darker font.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.190 align:middle line:10%
But it says use words that are
less narrow, less pejorative.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.780 align:middle line:10%
And then it says what kind
of a car if it is not new?

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.580 align:middle line:10%
Is it a used car?

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.470 align:middle line:10%
Is it a reconditioned car?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:10%
Or is it a pre-owned car?

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:10%
And of course, you
know the answer.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:10%
We've all heard this.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And when you hear the
word pre-owned car,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:10%
you get this feeling
that it's pretty decent.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:10%
So I mess this up, you guys.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry to report.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:57.710 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to read
this screen here.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.842 align:middle line:10%
And I messed with it.

00:11:59.842 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:10%
I need to go up a
little higher, I think.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.342 align:middle line:10%
But I don't want it in
my face because it's

00:12:03.342 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:10%
interfering with my view.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.770 align:middle line:10%
So thank you.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Oh, there it is.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:09.650 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.240 align:middle line:10%
So a used car,
reconditioned car.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, what do you call
your spouse's previous wife?

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Ha, ha, ha.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:90%
His ex-wife?

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:90%
His former wife?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's OK.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:10%
What about his practice wife?

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:90%
After all, you're the good one.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that great?

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.410 align:middle line:10%
And doesn't it make you smile?

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Because when you say, oh,
that was his practice wife

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
it kind of puts her in her
place because, after all, it

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:90%
didn't work out.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:90%
So she was just for practice.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And oh, by the way, I'm always
thanking my husband's ex,

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
no, his practice wife
because she gave him

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.285 align:middle line:84%
a lot of training that
I didn't have to do.

00:12:48.285 --> 00:12:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:90%
OK, so who do you report to?

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:10%
How many times do
you say I have to?

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I have to pick up the kids.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I have to meet my husband.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.720 align:middle line:90%
I have to write this report.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:90%
I have to go to the airport.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.190 align:middle line:90%
What if you reframe that?

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:08.510 align:middle line:90%
How would you reframe it?

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.783 align:middle line:90%
What would you say?

00:13:10.783 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:10%
I like picking up
the kids on time

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.317 align:middle line:10%
because then they're happy that
they're not the last one there.

00:13:17.317 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:90%
My husband invited me to dinner.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%
I need to leave right now.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:10%
I have a report
that's due tomorrow.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:10%
Skip the have to
because what happens

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.810 align:middle line:10%
is when you say I have to,
you're pushing your energy out

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:10%
in front of you to somebody
else, to some other place,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:10%
to some other thing.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.007 align:middle line:10%
And then when mass
consciousness is running,

00:13:37.007 --> 00:13:38.840 align:middle line:10%
you get pulled into
that because you've been

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:10%
using to have to all the time.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.650 align:middle line:10%
Something is making you do
it, like the company store,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.540 align:middle line:10%
like those old stories.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And give up the right
way or the wrong way.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:10%
And instead, decide
this is a match for me.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.340 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't please me, rather
than using the words that

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.830 align:middle line:90%
are so heavily charged.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, one time people
traveled through a snowstorm

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:10%
to attend my class.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:10%
And they were quite exhausted
and pleased with themself

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:10%
that they had finally made it.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we're
here for the truth.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.900 align:middle line:84%
And without even realizing
it, out of my mouth

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.983 align:middle line:84%
came the words, well, you
came to the wrong place.

00:14:14.983 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:10%
I don't do truth.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is
what's valid for me.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Might not be valid for you.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And who am I to tell
you this is the truth?

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't make any sense to me.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:10%
And I'm constantly asking the
universe, who am I to do this?

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Or who am I to do that?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you
to do that as well.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Because it empowers you.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes the
universe will answer you.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's also pretty cool.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.817 align:middle line:10%
So now, the other thing that
a lot of people don't realize

00:14:45.817 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:10%
is there's a lot of help here.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:10%
There's help from the dragons,
the angels, your own guides,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:10%
serendipities, ETs of the light.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So the dragons came
in about 10 years ago

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.260 align:middle line:84%
and really moved
into consciousness.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
So they made their
presence known to me.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:02.980 align:middle line:84%
I was not really into
the dragon thing.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't excited about dragons,
even though one of my sons

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:10%
loved dragons and had lots
of little dragon toys.

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.050 align:middle line:10%
But it didn't mean anything
to me until they came in.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And they showed themselves
to me and explained

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that they were here for
clarity and for helping

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
people get through things
and getting things done.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:10%
So the number one
place I suggest

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:10%
you try this out, and don't
take my word for it, try it out,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:10%
and that is when you are caught
in LA traffic or any traffic

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:10%
really.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.900 align:middle line:10%
And you say to the dragons,
I'm asking the dragons--

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:10%
Maureen says the
dragons work wonders.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:10%
So I'm asking the dragons
to step in and help

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.910 align:middle line:10%
with the traffic.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.452 align:middle line:84%
And help everyone
get where they need

00:15:41.452 --> 00:15:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to go quickly and easily, not
only for me, but for everyone

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:90%
And watch what happens.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle line:10%
One day, a couple
of years ago, when

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:53.230 align:middle line:10%
we were in the Seattle
area, my husband and I

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.425 align:middle line:10%
were on the surface street
that had like 10 traffic

00:15:55.425 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:10%
lights that we
could see straight

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.510 align:middle line:10%
ahead of us, 10 of them.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were about
two blocks apart.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the freeway that we were
next to on the surface street

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.785 align:middle line:90%
was almost at a standstill.

00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And he turned to me and he said
you better call on the dragons,

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.470 align:middle line:90%
this is really bad.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And so I made an
out loud statement.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:10%
And all the lights turned green.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And they stayed green
until we got through

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:10%
like three miles
of surface streets.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:10%
And he said to me, in my
20 years of living here,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:10%
I have never seen that.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:90%
So you will be surprised.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:90%
So don't take my word for it.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.412 align:middle line:84%
Now, the angels, most everybody
knows about the angels.

00:16:35.412 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:10%
They're specialized angels.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.077 align:middle line:10%
You have a guardian angel.

00:16:38.077 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:10%
You may have other angel guides.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:10%
Some of you are part
angel or angelic energy.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So call upon your angels
because they're here en masse.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:90%
And they're all about miracles.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:10%
So when you need a big
solution in a hurry,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.320 align:middle line:10%
you just say, I need a miracle.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.930 align:middle line:10%
I need my angels to
help me get a miracle.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:10%
And watch what happens.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:10%
One time, my sister
lost an earring.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.270 align:middle line:90%
She had been trying on clothes.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And the earring
must have come off.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And she got home and realized
that she only had one earring.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was one of the
earrings that I had given her.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.407 align:middle line:90%
And it was a precious stone.

00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:14.207 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:14.207 --> 00:17:15.339 align:middle line:90%
So she was very upset.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And then she said,
oh, Maureen has

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:90%
all these angels around here.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to ask
Maureen's jewelry angels

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.425 align:middle line:90%
to help me find my earring.

00:17:21.425 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:10%
And then next morning when
she went out to her car,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:28.235 align:middle line:10%
it was by the tire of her car.

00:17:28.235 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:10%
I lost a pair of earrings that
one of my daughter-in-laws

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:10%
gave me when I was clearing
the snow off my car

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:10%
and found it three
days later from when

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:10%
the snow had gone down.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.510 align:middle line:10%
And my neighbor said, you're
never going to find that.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I don't know.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I have a good feeling.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.380 align:middle line:90%
And you can too.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even when people
are down, you can say,

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:47.925 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, you know,
you might be right,

00:17:47.925 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
but I'm kind of
hoping I'll be right.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That's a great way to respond
to someone's negativity, right?

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.388 align:middle line:10%
Is to choose to agree with them.

00:17:56.388 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:10%
That way you don't get
any more opposition.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.277 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, you might be right,
but I'm hoping I'm right.

00:18:01.277 --> 00:18:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And they might say, yeah,
I hope you're right too.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got two
hoping you're right.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty cool.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:90%
You've just reinforced it.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, the serendipities
may be new to you.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a group of beings
that our 11th dimensional.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
They came in and spoke
to a woman who is not

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.500 align:middle line:84%
as out there as I am, but
she's one of the guides that

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:90%
works with me.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Terry Young.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:10%
And she does do Akashic
records readings.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And she does travel
with me to China.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was meditating
one morning,

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.390 align:middle line:90%
and these beings came in.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we are
the serendipities,

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.495 align:middle line:84%
not a serendipity,
but the serendipities.

00:18:37.495 --> 00:18:39.620 align:middle line:10%
So when you're looking for
connections, when you're

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:10%
looking for that opportunity
for the doors to open

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:10%
and everything to step into a
place of power and connection,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:10%
ask the serendipities.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:10%
They're also very good
at solving problems.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:10%
And I will tell you
that I was in China one

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:10%
time when the paperwork that my
host had done was inaccurate.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to say she
lied, but you might.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.038 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, so she got in
trouble with the authorities.

00:19:10.038 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:10%
And now, they're knocking
on my door at midnight.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:10%
And they want to
know what to do.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:10%
And after I shoo them out
of my room at 4:00 AM,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:10%
because we've done everything
we could, I went to sleep

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:10%
and then was woken up.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:10%
And I was seeing this visual.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.960 align:middle line:10%
And it was kind of
like a piece of paper.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.250 align:middle line:10%
And it was being tidied
up and then folded up,

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:10%
kind of like origami.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:10%
And when it all got all done,
and I was seeing these beings,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:10%
and these beings look like
these neon gummy bears.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:10%
So I said, what is this?

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:39.247 align:middle line:10%
What am I seeing?

00:19:39.247 --> 00:19:41.330 align:middle line:10%
And they said, oh, well,
that's the serendipities.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:10%
They're fixing your problem.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:10%
Because I'd call them
in and asked them.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.000 align:middle line:10%
And the next day, Maureen,
you have a clean slate.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.800 align:middle line:10%
No problem.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.092 align:middle line:10%
They're not going to let us
continue with the workshop,

00:19:50.092 --> 00:19:51.175 align:middle line:10%
but you're not in trouble.

00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:52.884 align:middle line:10%
And I'm thinking thank
goodness because I

00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:54.710 align:middle line:10%
was there on a tourist
visa the first time.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:10%
After that, I got
a business visa.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:10%
You learn these things.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:10%
ETs of the light.

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:10%
I don't just assume that all
the ETs are 100% god light.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:10%
And I ask you to do the same.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:10%
Don't assume that.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:10%
Just ask for the ETs of
the light to help you.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:10%
And they will.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, how many of you have
had an experience where

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.248 align:middle line:10%
you feel like the whole room
has shifted and moved and yet,

00:20:20.248 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:10%
there's no earthquake,
and you think to yourself,

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:10%
how come I'm the
only one seeing that?

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:10%
That's a dimensional shift.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.967 align:middle line:10%
And there are many people that
are having this experience.

00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:10%
Another way it can happen is
in the middle of the night.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.498 align:middle line:10%
You'll wake up, and
you will be wide awake.

00:20:35.498 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to
go to the bathroom.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:10%
And you're thinking to
yourself, why am I wide awake.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:10%
And then there is a shift.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.780 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually feel
like your body's vibrating.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:49.210 align:middle line:10%
And there's like something
coming towards you.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't feel frightening.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:10%
It's just energetic.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to make a sound.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:10%
This is not the
sound it makes, but I

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:10%
think sound effects
sometimes help us visualize.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:58.990 align:middle line:10%
So here we go.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.540 align:middle line:10%
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:10%
And what that is is the energy
is coming in and giving you

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:10%
an upgrade.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And so you feel
it like that, just

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.278 align:middle line:10%
inching its way toward you.

00:21:11.278 --> 00:21:13.570 align:middle line:10%
And that's usually coming
from the ETs of the light who

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.650 align:middle line:10%
are helping you.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.170 align:middle line:10%
Now, one day, my husband was
laying next to me in bed.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:10%
I was wide awake.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:10%
He's sound asleep.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:26.990 align:middle line:10%
And his arm comes across
his body and onto my chest.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Then the download happened.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.590 align:middle line:10%
And then his hand moved back.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.505 align:middle line:10%
And he never woke up.

00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:10%
He got the upgrade
without even trying.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:10%


00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.180 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things that
people sometimes think

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:10%
is that the angels have so
much to do they can't help me.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.860 align:middle line:10%
But the angels were sent to
the Earth to help humanity.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And we're at the end of an age.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It's time.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like we're all teenagers.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be adults and
on our own pretty darn quick.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
We need some help
to get through it.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So I like to think of it
more like a game show.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And that you are
allowed and expected

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.230 align:middle line:90%
to ask for your lifeline.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.510 align:middle line:90%
And you should.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:13.093 align:middle line:10%
I also will encourage
you to say that when

00:22:13.093 --> 00:22:14.510 align:middle line:10%
you work with the
Akashic records,

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:20.730 align:middle line:10%
I like to say that it's like
taking an open book test.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.450 align:middle line:10%
When you have access to the
information around a decision,

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.260 align:middle line:10%
it's easier to know what
your best choice is.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.950 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I like to say
practice using 5D jargon.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:10%
It's all divine.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.300 align:middle line:10%
This came from a friend of
mine named Tracy Sanalow.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And whenever something
happens that upsets her,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.150 align:middle line:10%
instead of exclaiming a four
letter word that we often use,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:10%
she's oh, it's all divine.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.120 align:middle line:10%
And she immediately frames it so
that no matter what's going on,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:10%
the divine part of it's going
to shine through and give her

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.610 align:middle line:10%
a gift somehow, some way.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.220 align:middle line:10%
There's a new phrase to use.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.250 align:middle line:10%
OK, now this one
I read many years

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.290 align:middle line:10%
ago in Neale Donald
Walsh's book.

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And recently, I was
re-reviewing that book.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
And he tells the story
of how his mother always

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.680 align:middle line:84%
said god bless it when everyone
else is saying you know what.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.042 align:middle line:10%
She's saying god bless it.

00:23:15.042 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:10%
And he asked her
about it one time.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And she said, well, I sure
as heck want god to bless it.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.440 align:middle line:10%
I don't want that
other stuff to happen.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is one of my favorites.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.490 align:middle line:10%
And that is, well, the angels
better show me how really good

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.650 align:middle line:10%
they are.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.200 align:middle line:10%
And on occasion, I have
had miracles happen

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:10%
that defy explanation.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.430 align:middle line:84%
So my advice to you is
stop explaining things.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.780 align:middle line:84%
When something happens that
surprises you that you cannot

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
explain, instead of defining
what it is right away--

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.373 align:middle line:84%
let's say your keys are
not where you left them.

00:23:55.373 --> 00:23:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And you think to
yourself, well, I

00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:58.060 align:middle line:84%
must've have forgotten
what I did with them.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And then later you
come back, and they

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:90%
were exactly where they were.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
You were in a higher dimension
when you put them down.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And now when you're anxious
looking for them, you're not.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you can't see
them because they

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.680 align:middle line:90%
were in your 5D space.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.693 align:middle line:10%
So if you ask where
are my keys, you're

00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:13.360 align:middle line:10%
going to get this
feeling, well, they're

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:10%
in the same place I left them,
but you still can't find them

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.070 align:middle line:10%
because you're stressed.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.958 align:middle line:10%
You're all polarized.

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.750 align:middle line:10%
But then when you're
done with your errand,

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.333 align:middle line:10%
and you're not looking for them,
and then you open the drawer,

00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:25.315 align:middle line:10%
and they're there, you realize
aha, they were here all along.

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:26.440 align:middle line:10%
How come I didn't see them?

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
I was back in 3D.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.690 align:middle line:10%
If you've had this happen,
that's proof to you

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:10%
that you have been
5th dimensional.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:10%
Because when you put something
down when you're in 5D,

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:10%
and then you walk
away, and then you

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:40.660 align:middle line:10%
move into what I call a
stress zone because you're

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.520 align:middle line:10%
trying to get
something done, you've

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.140 align:middle line:10%
dropped your energy back down.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.790 align:middle line:10%
I have a friend who
came in one night,

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:10%
and she put her beautiful
emerald ring in the drawer.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:10%
She didn't have
time to put it away.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.113 align:middle line:10%
She just dropped it in the top
drawer of her bedroom dresser.

00:24:54.113 --> 00:24:56.280 align:middle line:10%
The next day, she went
looking for it to put it away

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.155 align:middle line:10%
and couldn't find it.

00:24:57.155 --> 00:24:59.770 align:middle line:10%
She looked for three months
every time she thought of it.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:10%
Ah, I should really
look for that ring.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Finally said, OK, it's lost.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.085 align:middle line:10%
I give up and stopped
stressing about it.

00:25:07.085 --> 00:25:08.710 align:middle line:10%
The next time she
opened up her drawer,

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.810 align:middle line:10%
there it was right on top.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:10%
Amazing.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:13.720 align:middle line:10%
Amazing.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:10%
OK, so your new favorite phrase
is I wonder what's going on.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Can you see that?

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Is that visible?

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.205 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
to fix this slide?

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it visible?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.512 align:middle line:84%
From my angle, it looks
just like it's all white.

00:25:25.512 --> 00:25:26.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.527 align:middle line:90%
OK, so I wonder what's going on.

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:90%
That's your new favorite phrase.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.070 align:middle line:84%
When something happens
that defies explanation,

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:35.572 align:middle line:90%
don't just go solve it.

00:25:35.572 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Let the universe
show you something

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.988 align:middle line:90%
you hadn't seen before.

00:25:37.988 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you and I are
all slipping into 5D

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
pretty regularly.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:90%
I wonder how that will work out.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is another
favorite phrase of mine.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, when I was
first starting out,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.000 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't always have enough
money to cover everything,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I got a bill for
some advertising

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.060 align:middle line:90%
that my guide told me to get.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was a lot of money.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:90%
And I had just paid the rent.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.500 align:middle line:90%
And I was I was tapped out.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this bill,
and I'm thinking, OK, so

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:90%
now what do I do?

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.670 align:middle line:10%
And I remember
hearing myself say I

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.290 align:middle line:10%
wonder how that will work out.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:17.140 align:middle line:10%
The universe must know something
I don't know because why would

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:10%
I get a bill if I can't pay it?

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.280 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that a great
way to look at it?

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And you know, it's amazing
how that just kind of creates

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.690 align:middle line:10%
opportunity for us.

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:10%
OK, the universe knows
something I don't know.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.117 align:middle line:10%


00:26:34.117 --> 00:26:35.950 align:middle line:10%
And then you just come
up with this because.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.413 align:middle line:10%
You can fill in the blank.

00:26:37.413 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:10%
So that's another
favorite phrase.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:10%
The universe must know
something I don't know.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, anybody who's
ever heard me talk

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
knows that I really
emphasize using this phrase.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking for a day of
heaven on Earth for me

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:84%
and everyone I come
in contact with.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:90%
But I've added a few things.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
One of them is this idea that
you can also change the word

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.655 align:middle line:90%
contact to contract.

00:27:00.655 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:10%
So you'll notice
on this version,

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.462 align:middle line:10%
it says contract
because, after all, I

00:27:04.462 --> 00:27:06.670 align:middle line:10%
might be in contract with
somebody that's not with me

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:07.730 align:middle line:10%
today, like my webmaster.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:10%
I want him to have a day
of heaven on Earth too.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:10%


00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:14.795 align:middle line:10%
And what happens is
the energy changes.

00:27:14.795 --> 00:27:16.420 align:middle line:10%
So you're standing
in line in the bank,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.400 align:middle line:10%
and the person in front of
you is giving the teller

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.240 align:middle line:10%
a really hard time.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.400 align:middle line:10%
And she's in a terrible
mood because of that.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:10%
You come along and
everything is all

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:10%
stars and smiles because you're
holding that vibration so large

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:10%
that it impacts positively
everyone around you.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:10%
So one of my students
said, you know,

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.367 align:middle line:10%
I have a family
reunion coming up.

00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:38.200 align:middle line:10%
And everybody in my
family gets along really

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.700 align:middle line:10%
well except for one
person, my sister.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.290 align:middle line:10%
And she's kind of
like a drama queen.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And she always ruins
it for everybody.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:10%
We're going to spend
a whole week together

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.090 align:middle line:10%
in one house in this
place in North Carolina.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.330 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
wonderful, we hope.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And so she said, I'm
asking for a week of heaven

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:10%
on Earth for my family reunion.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:10%
So I said, well, that's great.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.040 align:middle line:10%
So after the event, I said,
well, how'd that turn out?

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.540 align:middle line:10%
She said, well, a couple
of days before the event

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:10%
my sister called and told
us that she wasn't going

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:10.720 align:middle line:10%
to come because she was checking
herself into a detox facility.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:10%
Now, this particular
sister, of course,

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.330 align:middle line:10%
thought she was punishing
everybody by not being there.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And she said, we
had the best time.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:90%


00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.905 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a big one.

00:28:23.905 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:10%
I am quite certain you
don't know that you're

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:28.300 align:middle line:10%
teaching your children to lie.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And here's how you do it.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Did you eat all the
cookies in the cookie jar?

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.620 align:middle line:90%
Did you do all your homework?

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Is your bed made?

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:10%
You know perfectly well
what the answer is.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:45.640 align:middle line:10%
So stop asking your
children questions

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:10%
that you already
know the answer to.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.800 align:middle line:10%
And reframe it so that you're
not teaching them to lie.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:10%
How do you reframe it?

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Well, one day I came home--

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.020 align:middle line:10%
now, remember, I
have four sons--

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:10%
and the trampoline
was dangerously

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.410 align:middle line:10%
close to the garage,
which had a low roof.

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:10.030 align:middle line:10%
And I said at dinner, I notice
where the trampoline was.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm wondering if
you guys would move it

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:15.640 align:middle line:10%
back to the center of the yard
where it belongs because I know

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.242 align:middle line:10%
you guys know better than to
jump off the roof of the garage

00:29:19.242 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:10%
onto the trampoline, but I'm
not so sure about the neighbor

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:10%
kids.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.083 align:middle line:90%


00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:27.500 align:middle line:10%
Next day, the
trampoline was right

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.378 align:middle line:10%
where it was supposed to be.

00:29:29.378 --> 00:29:30.920 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't have
to yell at anybody.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't have to say
who moved the trampoline

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.073 align:middle line:10%
and have them go like this.

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:35.990 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was his idea.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.020 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, but you did it.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:37.820 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.080 align:middle line:10%
Who needs that?

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.820 align:middle line:10%
And again, we're
teaching them to lie

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:10%
when we ask them questions we
already know the answer to.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.630 align:middle line:10%
So it's tricky.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.340 align:middle line:10%
If you know the answer,
don't ask that question.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.670 align:middle line:10%
Ask a question that honors them.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:10%
I noticed this morning when
I walked by your bedroom

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.713 align:middle line:10%
that the bed wasn't made.

00:29:53.713 --> 00:29:55.130 align:middle line:10%
You know, I'm sure
you'll remember

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.970 align:middle line:10%
to make it before you leave.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.400 align:middle line:10%
Like that, you see?

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.670 align:middle line:10%
That changes the
energy and puts trust

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:10%
into your relationship
with your children.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.910 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.900 align:middle line:10%
Stop weather prediction.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Now this is very interesting.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.810 align:middle line:10%
How many of you look at
the weather regularly?

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:14.732 align:middle line:10%
OK, my husband calls
me the app queen

00:30:14.732 --> 00:30:16.940 align:middle line:10%
because I have a lot of
apps, and I really like them.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.010 align:middle line:10%
But you know which
one I don't have?

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:10%
The weather app.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.540 align:middle line:10%
You know why?

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:10%
Because it's a
form of prediction.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.480 align:middle line:10%
And when we read
it and get worried

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:10%
about the rain or the
fierce storm that's coming

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:32.180 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps even
the sunshine, we're

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:10%
reinforcing their expectation.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, I've done a lot of
research on weather prediction

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:10%
and how it's done.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:10%
And they use modeling
and multiple versions

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.190 align:middle line:10%
of the reality.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.232 align:middle line:10%
And then they layer it,
and they get percentages.

00:30:46.232 --> 00:30:47.780 align:middle line:10%
That's why you get
40% chance of rain

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.790 align:middle line:10%
because they've done
like 4,000 models.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And they throw
them all together,

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:53.930 align:middle line:10%
and that's how they come
up with this average.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things that
I was taught by my guides

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.950 align:middle line:10%
was how to alter the weather.

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:04.095 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, at one point,
my students in New York

00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.470 align:middle line:10%
could say we could always tell
when Maureen's coming back

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.210 align:middle line:10%
to New York because
it's really nice out,

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.910 align:middle line:10%
and it's still only
April or March.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:10%
And I wasn't actually
purposefully altering

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.270 align:middle line:10%
the weather, but I
was always so joyful

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:10%
that the energy would
respond in kind.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.160 align:middle line:10%
And one day, I was taught how
to manipulate the weather.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.590 align:middle line:10%
And I asked who am I
to alter the weather.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.360 align:middle line:10%
And I was told, well,
who are you not to.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.160 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.400 align:middle line:10%
The Chinese have been altering
the weather for the last 50

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.390 align:middle line:10%
years.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't believe it.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.850 align:middle line:10%
And they said Google it.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.360 align:middle line:10%
Now, this goes back to 1994,
you guys, a long time ago.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.930 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, there were
articles about Chinese weather

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:51.590 align:middle line:10%
manipulation, which I had not
even considered a possibility.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:55.790 align:middle line:10%
So then one day I was in
Paris for a family wedding.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And the wedding was going
to be in Brittany, which

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:10%
is known for its rainy weather.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.020 align:middle line:10%
It's like Seattle weather.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:10%
And I asked ahead
of time would I

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.770 align:middle line:10%
be permitted, because I still
want to check in with guidance

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:10.740 align:middle line:10%
to alter the weather.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:10%
And I was told this is
the bride's decision.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.080 align:middle line:10%
That had never occurred to me.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have thought
to ask the bride.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, what's even crazier
is my niece, the bride,

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.530 align:middle line:10%
actually understood who
I was better than I did.

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.070 align:middle line:10%
And so when I said what
would you desire with regard

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.948 align:middle line:10%
to the weather.

00:32:28.948 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:10%
It was like she was
talking to the caterer.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, I want the weather to
warm up to about 60 degrees.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:10%
I want the rain to stop.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.600 align:middle line:10%
I want a small breeze to dry
everything off on the grass.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.830 align:middle line:10%
And she went on for
like three minutes.

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.820 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:10%
And at 20 minutes till 4:00,
the wedding was at 4:00,

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm holding my breath.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.210 align:middle line:10%
You guys, the wedding's
starting soon.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:52.580 align:middle line:10%
You can call off the rain,
because it was raining

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:10%
cats and dogs all day long.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:02.100 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, within three
minutes, the sun came out.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:10%
And all the French women wore
their big hats that they wear.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:11.200 align:middle line:10%
And nobody carried an
umbrella into the wedding.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.630 align:middle line:10%
And one of the
things on her list

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:17.880 align:middle line:10%
was it has to stay
nice until tomorrow

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:10%
after lunch because my
husband's grandmother is

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.160 align:middle line:10%
throwing a party for everybody
who came in from overseas.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.580 align:middle line:10%
And the party's going to
be outside on the lawn.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:10%
So it stayed nice.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.890 align:middle line:10%
And as the staff were putting
away the tables and chairs,

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.950 align:middle line:10%
it started to rain
again really heavily

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.050 align:middle line:10%
and stayed that way
for the next few days.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:42.810 align:middle line:10%
When it was time to
leave, I was standing

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:10%
there next to the bride
saying my goodbyes.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.970 align:middle line:10%
And someone said to
her, wasn't it wonderful

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:53.460 align:middle line:10%
how the weather stayed nice
for your event and the party

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:10%
your grandma threw?

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.240 align:middle line:10%
And she looked at me
and I mouthed to her

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.920 align:middle line:10%
don't bother telling anyone.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:10%
They will never believe you.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, why do I say stop
the weather prediction?

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.360 align:middle line:10%
And that is when you
agree with the weather

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.480 align:middle line:10%
by reading the weather
and accepting it,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.780 align:middle line:10%
you are giving over your
power to mass consciousness.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.699 align:middle line:10%
You don't want to
do that anymore.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.762 align:middle line:10%
You want to empower yourself.

00:34:19.762 --> 00:34:21.179 align:middle line:10%
And when you empower
yourself, you

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.387 align:middle line:10%
begin to realize how
very powerful you are.

00:34:23.387 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:10%
When you realize how
very powerful you are,

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.554 align:middle line:10%
you can start to make more
things happen for you that you

00:34:27.554 --> 00:34:29.020 align:middle line:10%
need to have happen.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.110 align:middle line:10%
And that's why you
don't participate

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.453 align:middle line:10%
in weather prediction.

00:34:32.453 --> 00:34:33.870 align:middle line:10%
And when it's time
to get dressed,

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.923 align:middle line:10%
you ask, is it my highest and
best good to wear this sweater?

00:34:36.923 --> 00:34:39.090 align:middle line:10%
Is it my highest and best
good to carry an umbrella?

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:10%
One time I was told
to carry an umbrella

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.440 align:middle line:10%
and I said, which one-- the
compact one or the long cane?

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.550 align:middle line:10%
Carry the cane.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.580 align:middle line:10%
I never opened that umbrella,
but I did trip and fall.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:10%
I did trip and almost
fall, but I had a cane.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.139 align:middle line:10%
Who have you asked?

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:10%
What have you asked?

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:00.510 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
that my husband and I do,

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:10%
and I got this from
Demartini, and he says,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.143 align:middle line:10%
what have you ordered from
the universe this morning?

00:35:09.143 --> 00:35:10.560 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk
about what are you

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.727 align:middle line:10%
going to have for breakfast.

00:35:11.727 --> 00:35:14.350 align:middle line:10%
What have you ordered
from the universe today?

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.670 align:middle line:10%
And put in your order.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:16.887 align:middle line:10%
Put in your order early.

00:35:16.887 --> 00:35:17.720 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that fabulous?

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.660 align:middle line:10%


00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.530 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing we do
is, when we have dinner,

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:10%
we go through three gratitudes.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.010 align:middle line:10%
And we take turns.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:31.440 align:middle line:10%
And it's so much fun to see
what we're grateful for.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.140 align:middle line:10%
And sometimes my
husband surprises me

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.050 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes I surprise him.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And that's a lot of fun.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.758 align:middle line:10%
So if you have friends
who you live with,

00:35:37.758 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:10%
a roommate, you could
say, hey, let's do this

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:41.683 align:middle line:10%
for an exercise when I see you.

00:35:41.683 --> 00:35:43.100 align:middle line:10%
When you first get
home from work,

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.400 align:middle line:10%
why don't we share what
we have grateful for?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.382 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:35:46.382 --> 00:35:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:53.262 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, this is a
very important piece.

00:35:53.262 --> 00:35:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I talked about mass
consciousness a little bit.

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can get pulled
into mass consciousness.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.055 align:middle line:84%
And one of the fastest
ways you get pulled in

00:35:59.055 --> 00:36:00.573 align:middle line:90%
is through your fear.

00:36:00.573 --> 00:36:02.240 align:middle line:10%
And I would highly
recommend you look up

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.180 align:middle line:10%
my blog post on fear and loosh.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.220 align:middle line:10%
Your fear feeds into
mass consciousness

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:11.960 align:middle line:10%
because like attracts like.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.950 align:middle line:10%
So your fear allows you to tap
into that mass consciousness

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.720 align:middle line:10%
fear that sometimes
is being projected.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:19.490 align:middle line:10%
It might not even be real.

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:23.360 align:middle line:10%
And you move into a
place of absolute fear

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:29.310 align:middle line:10%
of your presumed
problem or outcome.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:31.790 align:middle line:10%
So when you find yourself
fearful, and we all do,

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.260 align:middle line:10%
including me, immediately
unhook from that

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:41.360 align:middle line:10%
and tell yourself
fear is a messenger.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:10%
Fear is a messenger.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's here
telling me something.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.470 align:middle line:10%
And this is not true for
100% of the population,

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.930 align:middle line:10%
but it is true for 100% of
the people who are here.

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.890 align:middle line:10%
And that is fear is telling you
when you are out of integrity

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:10%
with your hopes,
dreams, and desires.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.850 align:middle line:10%
So I'll give you an example.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.610 align:middle line:10%
This happened to me early on.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.710 align:middle line:10%
I had bought a
really nice jacket.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.890 align:middle line:10%
It was the perfect color
for me, matched everything

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:10%
in my wardrobe.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:10%
And it was on sale for $50.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:10%
A week later, utility bill came.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.570 align:middle line:10%
And I was terrified.

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.120 align:middle line:10%
And I couldn't figure out why
a $50 bill from the utility

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.380 align:middle line:10%
company would frighten me.

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.360 align:middle line:10%
I was living, you know,
pretty close to the edge.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.810 align:middle line:10%
And when I close my eyes, and
I said I can feel the fear.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.860 align:middle line:10%
What's your message?

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.200 align:middle line:10%
And I had never
done this before.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.970 align:middle line:10%
I was shown the jacket.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's when I
realized that when

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:34.140 align:middle line:10%
I bought that jacket
taking advantage of a sale

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:37.080 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't aware of my
budget or how much money I

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.912 align:middle line:10%
had to cover the family bills.

00:37:38.912 --> 00:37:40.620 align:middle line:10%
So it was at that
point, again, because I

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.240 align:middle line:10%
was living in such
a tight budget

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:10%
money-wise, that I made
a real budget for myself

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:10%
and allocated money for fun
and games and other money

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.530 align:middle line:10%
for the necessities of life.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.680 align:middle line:10%
So that I always made sure
I had that part covered.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.888 align:middle line:10%
Because I felt very strongly
that I wanted to provide

00:37:57.888 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:10%
for myself and my children.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.778 align:middle line:10%
And that luxuries are luxuries.

00:38:01.778 --> 00:38:03.570 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't
absolutely need something,

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:05.370 align:middle line:10%
that it doesn't go
into that category.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.328 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole book
that I wrote about all

00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:08.640 align:middle line:10%
this called "Be A Genie".

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.260 align:middle line:10%
And I teach you how
to manifest by using

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:10%
sacred geometry as the proof.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.640 align:middle line:10%
But even if you don't use the
sacred geometry as the proof,

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:10%
you can still learn to manifest
through this marvelous system.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:24.230 align:middle line:10%
OK, so how to get answers
and how to know what's

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.030 align:middle line:10%
really going on.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.650 align:middle line:10%
So first, we're going
to talk about a system

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:10%
that my fantastic introducer--

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.000 align:middle line:10%
where are you, there you are--

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.800 align:middle line:10%
mentioned.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.670 align:middle line:10%
And it's true.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:38.340 align:middle line:10%
The Merkaba is an amazing tool.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.332 align:middle line:10%
And it is a vehicle that you
learn to spin around your body.

00:38:43.332 --> 00:38:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Come on.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.720 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.510 align:middle line:10%
It's supposed to spin.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Did it spin?

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:50.390 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Did it spin?

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:56.570 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:57.510 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that cool?

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:59.010 align:middle line:90%
So it spins in two directions.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, no one is
really teaching

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
that particular 17-breath
Merkaba anymore.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to learn it,
you can because I made a DVD.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.570 align:middle line:90%
And you can buy the DVD.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:13.120 align:middle line:90%
So it's readily available.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.640 align:middle line:90%
And I do recommend learning it.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.647 align:middle line:10%
And then in the new
book "Waking Up in 5D",

00:39:18.647 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:10%
I actually teach you a
more evolved version, which

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.838 align:middle line:10%
I'll talk about momentarily.

00:39:22.838 --> 00:39:24.630 align:middle line:10%
This is something else
I want you to learn.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:10%
And this is the higher
self connection.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.650 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to
take just a moment,

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:30.150 align:middle line:10%
and Kim is going
to hand this out.

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.525 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is my
ideal opportunity

00:39:31.525 --> 00:39:36.540 align:middle line:10%
to introduce Kim who is
my angel and saving grace.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.157 align:middle line:10%
She is our projects manager.

00:39:38.157 --> 00:39:39.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's such a great
title because she does

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.890 align:middle line:10%
every project, every project.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:47.910 align:middle line:10%
And we've had the good fortune
of being connected to one

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.258 align:middle line:10%
another for almost eight years.

00:39:50.258 --> 00:39:52.050 align:middle line:10%
And she worked for me
for a number of years

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.750 align:middle line:10%
and then wanted to
focus on something else

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.190 align:middle line:10%
that she was working on.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:59.670 align:middle line:10%
And so she and I both wanted
to move to California.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:10%
And within a couple of
years, we both realized

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:03.390 align:middle line:10%
that she was available again.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:07.130 align:middle line:10%
And the rest is history.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.930 align:middle line:10%
I'm so happy.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.597 align:middle line:10%
So now, I want you
to read through this.

00:40:09.597 --> 00:40:11.520 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm going
to explain this.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.730 align:middle line:10%
If you will follow this
protocol for 45 days,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:19.180 align:middle line:10%
you will get a 100% accurate
connection with your higher

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:19.980 align:middle line:10%
self.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.062 align:middle line:10%
And the rules are pretty simple.

00:40:22.062 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
get yes/no signals.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.320 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do
that just a moment.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.630 align:middle line:10%
Unimportant questions only.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.710 align:middle line:10%
No important questions.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:29.970 align:middle line:10%
Make those exceptions rare.

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.890 align:middle line:10%
That's the detail on the card.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.300 align:middle line:10%
And no divination tools.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:10%
No muscle testing, no pendulums.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:38.290 align:middle line:10%
Put all that aside for
six weeks or 45 days.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:10%
So let's just figure this out.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.150 align:middle line:10%
When is 45 days from now?

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:45.450 align:middle line:10%
Today is what?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:55.437 align:middle line:10%
So April, what, 10th?

00:40:55.437 --> 00:40:56.520 align:middle line:10%
Who came up with the date?

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, April 10th.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.090 align:middle line:10%
>> April 10th.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:10%
See?

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:10%
I just pulled it in.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:10%
I didn't bother doing the math.

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:10%
OK, April 10th.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:06.840 align:middle line:10%
So the reason I want
you to know that is

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.187 align:middle line:10%
because if you decide
to do this protocol,

00:41:09.187 --> 00:41:10.770 align:middle line:10%
you want to know
what's going forward.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.660 align:middle line:10%
You don't care about when
you were in this class.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:14.970 align:middle line:10%
You might not remember when
you went to Conscious Life Expo

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.303 align:middle line:10%
or when you were in my workshop.

00:41:16.303 --> 00:41:20.322 align:middle line:10%
So this is your opportunity
to take a moment and do this.

00:41:20.322 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to repeat
what I did in the beginning

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.980 align:middle line:10%
when I asked you to open
your heart and do that again.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.730 align:middle line:10%
And allow yourself to
remember a time when

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:10%
you've held a beloved being.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.030 align:middle line:10%
It does not have to
be your pet, does not

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.102 align:middle line:10%
have to be your infant.

00:41:31.102 --> 00:41:32.310 align:middle line:10%
But you've held a little one.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.893 align:middle line:10%
And hear yourself
tell this little one

00:41:33.893 --> 00:41:35.220 align:middle line:10%
I love you three times.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:40.380 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.850 align:middle line:10%
Send a beam of love and
light up your pranic tube.

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:48.010 align:middle line:90%


00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.650 align:middle line:10%
Connect to your
higher self and allow

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:54.680 align:middle line:10%
your higher self to slide
back into your heart with you.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.590 align:middle line:10%
And it can be an energy,
a beam, doesn't matter.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:59.745 align:middle line:10%
And your heart's suddenly
bigger than it was.

00:41:59.745 --> 00:42:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to have
a conversation with a higher

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:02.390 align:middle line:90%
self.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
give you this script.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to say after
me in your thought, higher self,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.045 align:middle line:10%
give me my signal
or symbol for yes.

00:42:12.045 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.880 align:middle line:10%
Could be a color.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.600 align:middle line:10%
Could be a shape.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.970 align:middle line:10%
It could be a sensation
like an itchy ear.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.020 align:middle line:10%
Could be the word yes.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:35.040 align:middle line:10%
Could be a taste in your mouth.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.190 align:middle line:10%
Higher self, do it again.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.570 align:middle line:10%
Give me my signal for yes.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:44.995 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Higher self, give
me a signal for no.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.580 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:54.400 align:middle line:10%
What does no look like, feel
like, taste like, sound like?

00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.960 align:middle line:10%
Do it again.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.850 align:middle line:10%
Higher self, give
me my signal for no.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.800 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.830 align:middle line:10%
Higher self, give me my
symbol or signal for neutral.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes neutral
is hard to feel,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.460 align:middle line:10%
so don't be too stressed
if you don't get anything

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:23.380 align:middle line:10%
that's really noticeable.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, for practice, higher
self, one more time

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.310 align:middle line:10%
show me my signal for yes.

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:39.980 align:middle line:10%


00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Show me my signal for no.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.300 align:middle line:90%


00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.060 align:middle line:10%
Show me my signal for neutral.

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So we give thanks
to the higher self.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And we tell our higher self
I want to practice with you.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
give it 45 days.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:43:58.530 align:middle line:90%
And I'll do my part.

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.982 align:middle line:90%
And I'm asking you to do yours.

00:44:01.982 --> 00:44:02.928 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:02.928 --> 00:44:05.770 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:07.520 align:middle line:10%
Now, open your
eyes and write down

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.530 align:middle line:10%
the signal or symbol you got.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.230 align:middle line:10%
Because later, you're going
to doubt it or turn it around.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.280 align:middle line:10%
And we don't want
that to happen.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.940 align:middle line:10%
So some of you have
done this with me,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.352 align:middle line:10%
and so you know this one,
but I'll give you a moment.

00:44:19.352 --> 00:44:21.810 align:middle line:10%
And I recommend if you haven't
written it anywhere to write

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:22.977 align:middle line:10%
on the card we've given you.

00:44:22.977 --> 00:44:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's the bomb.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.450 align:middle line:10%
You can no longer trust
spiritual teachers.

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.730 align:middle line:10%
That means me too.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:43.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, I think that's funny.

00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'm always
disappointed whenever

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:47.740 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't burst out
laughing because I

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.600 align:middle line:10%
think it's really funny.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm teaching
you how to know.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm teaching you how to fish.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:57.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm not giving you fish.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.420 align:middle line:10%
I'm teaching you how to fish.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:03.510 align:middle line:10%
This way-- there are a
lot of teachers out there.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.170 align:middle line:10%
There's a huge growth of
teachers understandably

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.670 align:middle line:10%
because there's going to be a
huge growth of people shifting

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:09.470 align:middle line:10%
and transforming.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.515 align:middle line:10%
And they need those leaders
to show them the way.

00:45:12.515 --> 00:45:13.890 align:middle line:10%
But sometimes
those leaders might

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.910 align:middle line:10%
be giving false information.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.850 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they don't
even know it's false.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.450 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe it's not
false for everyone,

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.060 align:middle line:10%
but it's false for you.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:10%
In the old days, you would
walk away from the teacher.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.170 align:middle line:10%
You'd say, well,
that's the end of that.

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:10%
But today, I can look at you
and say, well, maybe there's

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:10%
more for you to learn.

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:35.243 align:middle line:10%
You could ask your higher
self, do I keep coming back?

00:45:35.243 --> 00:45:37.660 align:middle line:10%
Just because you found one
thing that wasn't true for you,

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.290 align:middle line:10%
do you so keep coming back?

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.517 align:middle line:10%
The answer might be yes.

00:45:42.517 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:10%
You'll know when you're
done because you will have

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.995 align:middle line:10%
had your higher self help you.

00:45:45.995 --> 00:45:48.470 align:middle line:10%
Now, what happens to
you after your 45 days?

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is after 45 days
you begin this conversation.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:55.220 align:middle line:10%
You might even begin having
this conversation now.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:10%
But during your
practice period you're

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:01.050 align:middle line:10%
not allowed to ask
anything important.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.740 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is
you want to get

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.160 align:middle line:10%
so familiar with
your signal or symbol

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.490 align:middle line:10%
that you get that
it is irrefutable.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.480 align:middle line:10%


00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:10%
Before we had phone
ID, if somebody

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:10%
called you and you heard their
voice, you'd know who it was.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.560 align:middle line:10%
You'd say, oh, hi.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.540 align:middle line:10%
How you doing?

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.900 align:middle line:10%
I haven't heard from you
in a couple of weeks.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.040 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.150 align:middle line:10%
You would know who it was just
by them saying hello and saying

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:10%
your name.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:32.200 align:middle line:10%
That's what you're doing.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.420 align:middle line:10%
You're developing a rapport
with your higher self.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, you need to ask
40 or 50 times a day.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:40.240 align:middle line:10%
What kinds of things do you ask?

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, you don't ask should
I put my right shoe on

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.070 align:middle line:10%
or my left shoe.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:46.360 align:middle line:10%
That's silly.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:51.220 align:middle line:10%
But you could ask, do I wear the
black boots or the white ones?

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.610 align:middle line:10%
Is it my highest and best
good to wear this white shirt

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.250 align:middle line:10%
or this blue shirt?

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.750 align:middle line:10%
What if you were
planning on wearing

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:00.100 align:middle line:10%
a white shirt and
your higher self

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.775 align:middle line:10%
tells you to wear a
red one, and that's

00:47:01.775 --> 00:47:04.650 align:middle line:10%
the day you spill
ketchup on your shirt.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.210 align:middle line:10%
It's pretty handy.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.670 align:middle line:10%
Not going to show us much.

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:13.300 align:middle line:10%
OK, your higher self will
start to come in and give you

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.590 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.080 align:middle line:10%
And every single time
all you need to do is say

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:22.120 align:middle line:10%
is this my higher self telling
me xyz, yada yada yada?

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.595 align:middle line:10%
And only your higher self
will be allowed to answer yes.

00:47:24.595 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Always ask in the same way.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:10%
Higher self, blah blah blah.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.450 align:middle line:10%
When my children
lived at home with me,

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:38.850 align:middle line:10%
if I said, could someone get
me a glass of water or could

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:43.060 align:middle line:10%
I have a glass water,
nothing would happen.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.302 align:middle line:10%
But if I said one
of their names,

00:47:45.302 --> 00:47:47.010 align:middle line:10%
they would either do
it or tell a sibling

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.210 align:middle line:10%
you go get it for her.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.460 align:middle line:10%
But there would be a response.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.420 align:middle line:10%
You see?

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And I have, accidentally,
asked information

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:57.960 align:middle line:10%
and told to go ahead.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.820 align:middle line:10%
And when I came home
and asked at the altar,

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:01.080 align:middle line:10%
what was that all about.

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.950 align:middle line:10%
That was a big waste of my time.

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.120 align:middle line:10%
My higher self said
you never asked.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.710 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I did too.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:10.740 align:middle line:10%
No, you asked, but you
didn't say higher self.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.500 align:middle line:10%
And your lower self came in, and
your lower self was quite happy

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.720 align:middle line:10%
with that response.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.500 align:middle line:10%
I won't bother telling
you the details.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.890 align:middle line:10%
You can use your imagination.

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.750 align:middle line:10%
So this is a wonderful protocol.

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.610 align:middle line:10%
And I highly recommend it.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.040 align:middle line:10%
And I have had people seek
me out all over the world

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.060 align:middle line:10%
to thank me for how powerful it
is to help them make a decision

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.120 align:middle line:10%
on what they should do.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:10%
OK, next one, assume everyone
around you is a good person.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.810 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.120 align:middle line:10%
Instead of presuming
someone has got

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.030 align:middle line:10%
an agenda, what if
you presume they

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:50.120 align:middle line:10%
had something important
to teach you or show you?

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.780 align:middle line:10%
I speak to everybody--

00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.970 align:middle line:10%
the cab driver, the
people the elevators.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Some of you've been the
object of my questioning.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.440 align:middle line:10%
What's going on?

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.240 align:middle line:10%
What are you doing?

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:01.690 align:middle line:10%
What's that for?

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's in the
tone of your voice.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.980 align:middle line:10%
So when you make sure
that you are holding

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:12.823 align:middle line:10%
that space for others
to be their best self,

00:49:12.823 --> 00:49:14.990 align:middle line:10%
because you ask for a day
of heaven on Earth for you

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:10%
and everyone you're
in contact with,

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.795 align:middle line:10%
they will be influenced by it.

00:49:20.795 --> 00:49:24.857 align:middle line:10%
The next thing I want to teach
you about is the pineal gland.

00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:25.940 align:middle line:10%
You've all heard about it.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.900 align:middle line:10%
You've all had
information thrown at you.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to understand
how very important it is.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is probably
the most important doorway

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.860 align:middle line:84%
that you can work
on getting open.

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:49.450 align:middle line:10%
This is why this powerful
water is so important.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:54.380 align:middle line:10%
Because it helps you keep
that pineal gland clear.

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:10%
This is called You
are the Starfire

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:01.760 align:middle line:10%
water, thirst the fire.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Kind of reminds me of that song.

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:07.774 align:middle line:10%
"I Set Fire to the Rain" by--

00:50:07.774 --> 00:50:08.650 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.742 align:middle line:10%
So good water.

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:13.950 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're going to talk
about that in just a second.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:10%
So many ancient cultures knew
that the Third Eye, right here,

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:19.310 align:middle line:10%
and the pineal were related.

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.670 align:middle line:90%


00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:27.740 align:middle line:10%
So keeping both of these two
areas functional and clear

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.590 align:middle line:10%
would mean that you would have
a higher connection and a higher

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:31.820 align:middle line:10%
awareness.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:36.210 align:middle line:10%
And the more you do to improve
that, the better it will be.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:39.140 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to talk
about ways to clean and heal

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.713 align:middle line:10%
your Third Eye and your pineal.

00:50:43.713 --> 00:50:45.380 align:middle line:10%
And then we're going
to do a meditation.

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:47.422 align:middle line:10%
We're going to close with
a wonderful meditation.

00:50:47.422 --> 00:50:51.210 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.180 align:middle line:10%
So tamarind is a wonderful tool.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.500 align:middle line:10%
You can buy it in a tincture.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.410 align:middle line:10%
Iodide calc, this is a
very specialized formula.

00:50:58.410 --> 00:51:02.600 align:middle line:10%
Shilajit, which is tar
that's coming off of rocks.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.550 align:middle line:10%
It's loaded with micro minerals.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:05.490 align:middle line:10%
Bliss oils.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:06.780 align:middle line:10%
These come from Norm Shealy.

00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.330 align:middle line:10%
We'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.630 align:middle line:10%
AroMandalas, which is
a brand of healing oils

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:16.910 align:middle line:10%
that were created for me
that heal emotional wounds.

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:10%
And walking in nature.

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want to talk
to you a little bit

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:23.680 align:middle line:10%
about each one of these.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.980 align:middle line:10%
Fluoride is found in many dental
and medical products, not just

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.370 align:middle line:10%
toothpaste and bonding agents.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.790 align:middle line:10%
So whenever you
have dental work,

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:34.790 align:middle line:10%
you want to up
your game in terms

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:36.160 align:middle line:10%
of clearing out the fluoride.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.450 align:middle line:10%
And exposures to fluoride
has been pervasive.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:10%
Even if your drinking
water is not fluoridated,

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.847 align:middle line:10%
salt and even milk
are often fluoridated.

00:51:43.847 --> 00:51:44.930 align:middle line:10%
And you might not know it.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:10%
Even some spring
waters are fluoridated.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.450 align:middle line:10%
And that way they don't
have to constantly test

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:51.920 align:middle line:10%
them to see if they're safe.

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.450 align:middle line:10%
Fluoride is also used
in food packaging.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:59.270 align:middle line:10%
So the odds of never
experiencing fluoridated items

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:10%
is nearly slim.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:04.870 align:middle line:10%
So it's poisonous even
at one part per million.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And it causes fluorosis
and calcification,

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.740 align:middle line:10%
especially in the
pineal gland, but also

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.210 align:middle line:10%
in other parts of the body.

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:16.100 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to talk
about how to clean and heal,

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:18.420 align:middle line:10%
how to have maintenance,
and then how to activate it.

00:52:18.420 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to do that.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.800 align:middle line:10%
So healing and de-calcification.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.470 align:middle line:10%
Large amounts of damage can
occur from fluoridated water,

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:10%
some of the food
choices you make,

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.610 align:middle line:10%
and environmental toxins
that you might not be able

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.350 align:middle line:10%
do anything about.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:36.080 align:middle line:10%
One solution comes from a
website called Sacred Medicine.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.180 align:middle line:10%
And I highly recommend
these products.

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:40.100 align:middle line:10%
And I recommend that
you check them out.

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.770 align:middle line:10%
I do not get a
commission for it.

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.650 align:middle line:10%
I know the owner remotely,
but never met her in person.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.680 align:middle line:10%
She doesn't know
I'm promoting her.

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:53.480 align:middle line:10%
But I have been very impressed
with her work and her devotion.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:10%
She also has a newsletter
that's very informative.

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.820 align:middle line:10%
So this particular
formula is a formula

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.140 align:middle line:10%
that she sells in a tincture.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:02.510 align:middle line:10%
So I highly recommend it.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.640 align:middle line:10%
And it will shift.

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.063 align:middle line:10%
Now, what I would do, if it
were me, and I did do this,

00:53:09.063 --> 00:53:10.730 align:middle line:10%
I would ask my higher
self, higher self,

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:10%
do I need that formula?

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.450 align:middle line:10%
Don't just buy it
because Maureen said so.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:15.800 align:middle line:10%
Check with your higher self.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.560 align:middle line:84%
That's your new
authority, remember?

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, tamarind is used
mostly to improve digestion.

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:25.950 align:middle line:10%
It's also used in the well-known
Egyptian drink called karkade.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.350 align:middle line:10%
So if you've ever had a karkade.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.410 align:middle line:10%
It's almost always made with
tamarind and a sweetener.

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:32.278 align:middle line:10%
And the tamarind is a
little bit like what

00:53:32.278 --> 00:53:33.320 align:middle line:10%
we would use lemon juice.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.160 align:middle line:90%
It brings it out.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Sparks it up.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's also an
anti-inflammatory.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And Kim and I were
talking about an event

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.600 align:middle line:84%
that she went to
with her husband

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:49.850 align:middle line:84%
where she learned about
dysfunction of the brain.

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:52.670 align:middle line:10%
And so many of the
diseases of the brain

00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:54.980 align:middle line:10%
are related to inflammation.

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:58.440 align:middle line:10%
So you want to be doing things
that are anti-inflammatory.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.750 align:middle line:10%
There's a wonderful cookbook
called "The Hot Detox

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Cookbook".

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:08.090 align:middle line:10%
And it is good for both
vegans and non-vegans.

00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:11.360 align:middle line:10%
And this particular
cookbook will give you

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:16.040 align:middle line:10%
recipes and instructions on why
these things are so valuable.

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.203 align:middle line:10%
And it was given
to me as a gift.

00:54:20.203 --> 00:54:21.870 align:middle line:10%
And now it's the only
cookbook I'll use.

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:24.650 align:middle line:10%
The recipes are
fabulous, fabulous.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.580 align:middle line:10%
So it's "The Hot
Detox Cookbook".

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.850 align:middle line:10%
And I can't remember the name.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:30.930 align:middle line:10%
Do you know the name?

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:32.420 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, the woman is a Canadian.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:34.073 align:middle line:10%
And it's available on Amazon.

00:54:34.073 --> 00:54:35.240 align:middle line:10%
So you can buy it on Amazon.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.680 align:middle line:10%
You can buy it on your Kindle,
or you can buy the book.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:39.055 align:middle line:10%
I recommend the
book because it's

00:54:39.055 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:10%
like you got to hold it in
your hand and look at it.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.875 align:middle line:10%
Now, we're going to talk a
little bit about the Third Eye

00:54:43.875 --> 00:54:46.490 align:middle line:10%
chakra and say that all the
work you do in meditation

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:48.380 align:middle line:10%
helps to open up that
Third eye chakra.

00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.060 align:middle line:10%
And you know your
Third eye is open

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.430 align:middle line:10%
when you can feel
that energy right here

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.230 align:middle line:10%
in the middle of your forehand.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:10%
Some of you actually get visual.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.330 align:middle line:10%
And that's also a key that
you have your Third eye

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.620 align:middle line:10%
open in the moment.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, one thing you
need to understand

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.590 align:middle line:10%
is that you can also make
trouble for your Third eye

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:11.040 align:middle line:10%
by intaking something that
is damaging or harmful.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:12.960 align:middle line:10%
And what do I mean that?

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.100 align:middle line:10%
What you see on TV, or what
you might see on a video

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.990 align:middle line:10%
or in the movies.

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.065 align:middle line:10%
And whenever I'm in
the movies, and I'm

00:55:20.065 --> 00:55:21.440 align:middle line:10%
about to see
something violent, I

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:22.857 align:middle line:10%
can tell it's going
to be violent,

00:55:22.857 --> 00:55:24.197 align:middle line:10%
I immediately close my chakras.

00:55:24.197 --> 00:55:25.280 align:middle line:10%
And the way you do it is--

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to stand in
front of you and show you--

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.060 align:middle line:10%
put your hand on your head
and just bring your hand down

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:32.860 align:middle line:10%
like that.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.860 align:middle line:90%
That's all you have to do.

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:44.140 align:middle line:10%
So you put your hand
above your crown chakra

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.540 align:middle line:10%
and then bring your
hand all the way down

00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:52.030 align:middle line:10%
just like if you wanted
to close someone's eyes

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.710 align:middle line:10%
you would put your hand on
their lid and just push it down.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So it's like that.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone said, well, how
would you get your chakras

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.290 align:middle line:90%
to open up again?

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.680 align:middle line:84%
They will open automatically
the next time you

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.040 align:middle line:90%
need to have them available.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:10%
So that's not the problem.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:11.750 align:middle line:10%
When you do this, all that junk
will not enter your psyche.

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:16.840 align:middle line:10%
So if you're like me, if
you see something that's

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.970 align:middle line:10%
harsh or harmful, it circulates
in my view for about a week

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:24.700 align:middle line:10%
before it finally drops off.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much simpler just
to make this motion and be done.

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.230 align:middle line:90%
No one knows what you're doing.

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a great way to
close your chakra

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and to help you gain mastery
over this energy that

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.680 align:middle line:84%
is causing lots of
people lots of harm.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, your pineal, as you
know, is small by body weight,

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:47.020 align:middle line:84%
but its blood flow activity
is second only to the kidney.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So research tells
us that the pineal

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.790 align:middle line:84%
is affected by the
electromagnetic energy

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:53.330 align:middle line:90%
that we've talked about.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's also
sensitive to light.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And works with the
circadian rhythms, meaning

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.890 align:middle line:90%
the rhythms of the body.

00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is an art
piece, but it shows you

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.970 align:middle line:90%
what the pineal looks like.

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is affected
by radio frequencies,

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:16.510 align:middle line:84%
which is ELF, and also EMF,
which we all know about,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.030 align:middle line:90%
and Wi-Fi.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.468 align:middle line:90%
Free Wi-Fi everywhere.

00:57:21.468 --> 00:57:23.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't live in
an apartment building,

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:23.800 align:middle line:90%
you're fortunate.

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you live in an
apartment building,

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and you open up your phone
to connect to the internet,

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:32.750 align:middle line:90%
there's like 30 choices.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:36.170 align:middle line:10%
All those frequencies
are bombarding you.

00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:38.870 align:middle line:10%
So this is another
reason why I recommend

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:40.970 align:middle line:10%
you do that Faraday cage
thing that I taught you

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:42.680 align:middle line:10%
at the beginning.

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So I want to point out that
the pineal is at right angles

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:90%
to the Third Eye.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And this right angle business
that I pointed out to you

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.930 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, it's directly
related to a dimensional shift.

00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:57.980 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons why these
two organs are at right angles

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is because when you
connect through them,

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:03.710 align:middle line:84%
you actually can move out of
your body in this direction

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:05.053 align:middle line:90%
or this direction.

00:58:05.053 --> 00:58:06.470 align:middle line:84%
That's also why
sometimes when you

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:09.740 align:middle line:84%
get guidance that comes in it
comes in one angle or another

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's using
that 90 degree turn

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:13.760 align:middle line:90%
in your consciousness.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And you've opened
up the doorway.

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not like they have.

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.960 align:middle line:90%
You've opened the doorway.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.560 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot more to
teach about the right angle

00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:23.060 align:middle line:84%
business and the
dimensional shifts,

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.430 align:middle line:84%
but that's in a
different lecture.

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is very important
for the pineal is blood flow.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine, a yoga
teacher, just walked in.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.080 align:middle line:90%
He'll laugh at this.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure he's still
doing his head stands.

00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.386 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:58:38.386 --> 00:58:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, maybe he walked out just
as fast as he walked in.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:44.490 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I can't do this anymore.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Some of you maybe
never have tried.

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:50.430 align:middle line:90%
But I can't do this anymore.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.472 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard on my neck.

00:58:51.472 --> 00:58:57.930 align:middle line:84%
But I found that Gaia has
a wonderful shoulder stance

00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:59.040 align:middle line:90%
stool.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And you can use that
to do a Shoulder Stand.

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is me doing
my Shoulder Stand.

00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:09.010 align:middle line:10%
And even if you
aren't good at it,

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:10.770 align:middle line:10%
you can have someone help you.

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:13.530 align:middle line:10%
And you lean against a wall
initially when you start out.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.080 align:middle line:84%
But now, I can just go
straight up without any help.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.240 align:middle line:90%
I can even take two chairs.

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.153 align:middle line:10%
I do like two pillows
for my shoulders.

00:59:20.153 --> 00:59:21.570 align:middle line:10%
But I could take
these two chairs.

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:25.380 align:middle line:10%
But I have a dress on
so I won't demonstrate.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:30.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, walking in
nature re-acclimates you

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to the consciousness
of Mother Earth, which

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:36.660 align:middle line:90%
is still emitting pure energy.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:39.370 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:43.180 align:middle line:84%
One time, my husband and I were
in a national park for a week.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And the Wi-Fi was
pretty horrible,

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.380 align:middle line:84%
which was just as well, to put
all that stuff away, anyway.

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that they
were criss-crossing

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:57.332 align:middle line:84%
the sky like an apple pie
with their chem trails.

00:59:57.332 --> 00:59:59.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I have the ability
to antidote them.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.930 align:middle line:90%
So I was antidoting them.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were doing
it three times a day--

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.540 align:middle line:90%
at dawn, noon, and dusk.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's where there's
the least wind.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.940 align:middle line:10%
When the sun is at an
angle, it causes more wind.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.640 align:middle line:10%
And so they don't get
as much of effect.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.300 align:middle line:90%
So they were criss-crossing it.

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And I meditated on this.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Why would they do that
in the national parks?

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know why?

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
When you're in nature, you
are more likely to wake up.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So they were having to
put that energy out there

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
to keep you dumbed down,
to slow people down.

01:00:31.790 --> 01:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And there were millions
of people in the parks,

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't
seeing that elsewhere.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:38.810 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And I travel all over.

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.850 align:middle line:90%


01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And then I got a stiff neck.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.553 align:middle line:10%
So I turned to my
darling husband

01:00:47.553 --> 01:00:48.970 align:middle line:10%
and I said, have
I been difficult,

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:50.553 align:middle line:10%
because for me, if
I get a stiff neck,

01:00:50.553 --> 01:00:54.130 align:middle line:10%
it's usually because I'm
being a little stubborn.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
That's, you know, the
phrase, get a stiff neck.

01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
You're being stiff necked.

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.300 align:middle line:90%
So he said, no, no, you're fine.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.750 align:middle line:90%
So then I asked in meditation.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So why do I have
this stiff neck?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.095 align:middle line:10%
And they said,
well, you're being

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:08.800 align:middle line:10%
stubborn about the chem trails.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.350 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, really?

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:13.510 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Stop antidoting them.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
You're drawing
attention to yourself.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:21.490 align:middle line:90%
That had never occurred to me.

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:24.162 align:middle line:90%
So I ask about everything.

01:01:24.162 --> 01:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage
you to do the same,

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
especially once you hit your
45 days, which is April 10th.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:33.960 align:middle line:90%


01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Because your higher self
will tell you when you think

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:40.590 align:middle line:84%
you're doing a good
deed and you're not.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I get information
about people, and you will too,

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.240 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously, you know?

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to work out.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.600 align:middle line:90%
You don't just blurt it out.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.100 align:middle line:84%
You ask, am I to
tell this person?

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.530 align:middle line:84%
One more thing about the pineal
that I want to talk about

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.330 align:middle line:90%
is maintenance.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:03.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is try to
have your room dark.

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.970 align:middle line:10%
Get darkening curtains, as
well as shades for your eyes

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:15.870 align:middle line:10%
because the light affects
your skin as well as the eyes.

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.195 align:middle line:90%
So cover your eyes.

01:02:17.195 --> 01:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And I cover my eyes when
I travel on a plane.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Cover myself up with a
blanket and kind of make

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:23.710 align:middle line:90%
this little hood for myself.

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend you do the same
when you're going to sleep.

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Give your pineal a true rest.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And that circadian
rhythm then allows

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.080 align:middle line:84%
you to shift your consciousness
easier to your new time zone.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Some of you have traveled quite
a distance, and one of my tools

01:02:40.730 --> 01:02:42.600 align:middle line:84%
that I use when
I travel is I ask

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
my higher self to collect
all my parts that I

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:46.880 align:middle line:90%
have left everywhere.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So you know when I greet
people and talk to people,

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:50.857 align:middle line:84%
maybe I've left a
little piece of myself

01:02:50.857 --> 01:02:51.988 align:middle line:90%
to support that person.

01:02:51.988 --> 01:02:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe I've had some drama,
and I've left a piece of myself

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:55.850 align:middle line:90%
from the drama.

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So I asked my higher
self or my archangels

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to collect all my little parts
that have kind of floated off

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.913 align:middle line:84%
of me and send them to
my arrivals airport.

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
get off the plane,

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I ask that those parts of
me be integrated in me.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And oh by the way, they're
now in the new time zone

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because they've had all
that time to get integrated.

01:03:17.130 --> 01:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I shift to
that time that those

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.660 align:middle line:90%
lost parts were in and boom.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the current time zone.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And you won't have jet
lag, which is amazing.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.440 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, next I want to talk about
ways to activate your pineal.

01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
This is a product
from Norm Shealy.

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of you may
have heard of him.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is called
his Bliss Oils.

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And these oils-- he won't
say this on his website.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But can you hand me my red
journal that's over there?

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.180 align:middle line:90%


01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to tell you
that these oils will give you

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
certain releases of energy
and open up the pineal,

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.800 align:middle line:90%
as well as help heal your body.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.810 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
I intended to have this out and
ready for you, but I forgot.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:13.120 align:middle line:10%
So what the bliss oils do is--

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:21.472 align:middle line:10%


01:04:21.472 --> 01:04:23.430 align:middle line:10%
each one of these are
named after the elements.

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:29.300 align:middle line:10%
So there's air, fire, water,
and Earth and then crystal.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And the crystal is directly
related to the higher energies.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's also related
to, it turns out,

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.660 align:middle line:10%
to the same CD that I created
called crystal elohim.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.810 align:middle line:10%
My crystal elohim CD was made
maybe 10 or more years ago,

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:44.390 align:middle line:10%
but it's a very powerful
protective tool.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So the Ring of Fire which is--

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
each one of these
is called a ring.

01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's because you
use acupuncture points

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:51.840 align:middle line:90%
around the body.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.173 align:middle line:84%
And then they're called a ring
because it circles the body.

01:04:55.173 --> 01:04:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And it takes about five
minutes to do every morning.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.798 align:middle line:10%
And if you're really
sick you would

01:04:58.798 --> 01:05:00.260 align:middle line:10%
want to do it twice a day.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.100 align:middle line:10%
So the Ring of
Fire reduces stress

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:11.950 align:middle line:10%
and allows the aspect of your
fire or your anger energy

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.858 align:middle line:10%
to be restored to balance.

01:05:13.858 --> 01:05:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So even if you're angry
or upset about something,

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
it balances you out.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.130 align:middle line:10%
It raises DHEA, which
makes you young.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.150 align:middle line:10%
OK?

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.650 align:middle line:10%
And it heals trauma,
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes,

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.700 align:middle line:10%
neuropathy,
depression, back pain.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.810 align:middle line:10%
The Ring of Air is
simultaneity of thought.

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:38.620 align:middle line:10%
He doesn't say that on his
website, but I know it's true.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And he did write about this in
his book called "Conversations

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.720 align:middle line:90%
With G".

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.280 align:middle line:84%
So you could do
your own research,

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.697 align:middle line:84%
or you can let me
do the research.

01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:47.980 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you what it is.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So that means you're
able to be in the present

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and receive your own
guidance in the present.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And you're also
receiving guidance

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
about what's going on
with everybody else.

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:04.678 align:middle line:84%
You might not know you're
getting it, but you are.

01:06:04.678 --> 01:06:06.220 align:middle line:10%
It happens to me
and Kim all the time

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:10.240 align:middle line:10%
where I'm seeing what
she's been thinking.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It assists the
holographic thinking

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and assists in the
advancing of consciousness,

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.560 align:middle line:84%
mental creativity,
and symbolic thinking.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.500 align:middle line:10%
It will help you
integrate the idea

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.950 align:middle line:10%
of integration and
non-separation and advanced

01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:25.190 align:middle line:10%
mystical insights.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:28.510 align:middle line:90%


01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:31.330 align:middle line:10%
When stimulated with the Ring
of Earth, it will help autism,

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:35.530 align:middle line:10%
down syndrome, and rage,
raises your oxytocin,

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:40.000 align:middle line:10%
and neurotransmitters.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.340 align:middle line:10%
By the way, every known
psychotic disorder

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:50.950 align:middle line:10%
is related to disturbances
of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:54.170 align:middle line:84%
which is related to
replacing the oxytocin.

01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:58.510 align:middle line:10%
So ADHA, autism, anxiety,
and depression, addiction,

01:06:58.510 --> 01:07:02.440 align:middle line:10%
borderline personality disorder,
inadequate personality,

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.670 align:middle line:10%
and schizophrenia, psychopaths
all have too much oxytocin.

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:08.800 align:middle line:10%
And this will bring
you into balance.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The Ring of Water
provides balancing

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of the emotions, forgiveness,
and contacting the christ

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.300 align:middle line:90%
at heart.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
So you can be in
your high heart.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's useful for
edema and congestion

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and helps with obesity
and lowering cholesterol.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.200 align:middle line:84%
It brings emotional tranquility
and assists with rapport

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
with others in their
realms of life.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And it provides a
spiritual homeopathy

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
to balance the emotions.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.390 align:middle line:10%
The Ring of Earth is a
magnetic constant with Earth

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:43.800 align:middle line:10%
and it redesigns the human
body, overcoming phobias,

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.670 align:middle line:10%
and addictions, skin disorders,
overcoming seduction, illusion,

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:51.510 align:middle line:10%
possession, cerebral palsy, ALS,
confusion, and physical pain.

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It simulates calcitonin.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's the strongest
pain reliever in the body,

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:00.473 align:middle line:84%
40 to 60 times
more than morphine.

01:08:00.473 --> 01:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you have regular pain,
get that Ring of Earth,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.057 align:middle line:84%
or buy all of them
and learn them.

01:08:04.057 --> 01:08:06.630 align:middle line:90%


01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:10.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then the Ring
of Crystal regulates

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
overall energetic
system and assists

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
in the regeneration of
expansion of consciousness

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:23.410 align:middle line:90%
to the Akashic level.

01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:25.800 align:middle line:84%
And it reduces free
radicals by 80%.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.029 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's one way.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:31.720 align:middle line:10%
Then we have the product
line known as AroMandalas.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.729 align:middle line:10%
And these are
essential oil blends

01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:35.979 align:middle line:10%
that were channeled
by Mary Magdalene

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:38.290 align:middle line:10%
through a person that was
working for me at the time.

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:40.689 align:middle line:10%
She had a master's
degree in aroma therapy.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:46.060 align:middle line:10%
And she brought these forward.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And when she retired
for the third time,

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:51.220 align:middle line:10%
because my job with her
was a retirement job,

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:53.560 align:middle line:10%
she donated the formulas to me.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
She always felt the
formulas were for me.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't want
to promote them,

01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.340 align:middle line:90%
but we branded them together.

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.670 align:middle line:90%
And I promoted them.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.080 align:middle line:10%
And they sell worldwide.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.872 align:middle line:84%
And I highly recommend if you're
in any kind of the healing

01:09:05.872 --> 01:09:08.080 align:middle line:84%
arts, I highly recommend
that you get a set of these.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.910 align:middle line:10%
And you let your
clients play with them,

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:13.149 align:middle line:10%
or you use them beforehand
it helps them clear something

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.370 align:middle line:10%
basic that they need to clear.

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:17.410 align:middle line:84%
We like to play with
it and choose randomly.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:18.604 align:middle line:90%
And then we find out later.

01:09:18.604 --> 01:09:20.229 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have some
information on that

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
later at our book signing.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.580 align:middle line:90%


01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.000 align:middle line:10%
So here's a cute storyline.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.120 align:middle line:10%
Does anybody know what
happened when Ram Dass gave

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.109 align:middle line:10%
his teacher an illegal drug?

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:34.917 align:middle line:10%


01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:35.859 align:middle line:10%
Uh huh.

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:36.659 align:middle line:10%
Nothing.

01:09:36.659 --> 01:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%


01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.700 align:middle line:10%
He said he preferred meditation.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%


01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.680 align:middle line:10%
OK, now these are
the things you want

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.940 align:middle line:10%
to pay attention to-- your food
choices, exercise, inversion,

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.250 align:middle line:10%
light exposure,
control the light.

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.630 align:middle line:10%
This is kind of a recap.

01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:03.360 align:middle line:10%
The color indigo or other
shades of blue or tan

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.330 align:middle line:10%
will help you open
up your third eye.

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:10.480 align:middle line:10%
Because indigo is not really
part of the color spectrum,

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.640 align:middle line:10%
but tan is.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
interesting thing

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.060 align:middle line:10%
because all the colors
are made for mixtures

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.010 align:middle line:10%
of the primary colors.

01:10:18.010 --> 01:10:21.370 align:middle line:10%
So tan is the new indigo.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:23.020 align:middle line:10%
Interesting, isn't it?

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:26.350 align:middle line:10%
Sound, chanting, and
toning, and we're

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:28.240 align:middle line:10%
going to do a little toning.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.090 align:middle line:10%
Sacred geometry, all kinds.

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:34.540 align:middle line:10%
I was wearing bifocals
when I was in my 40s.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.970 align:middle line:10%
And I attribute
my good eyesight--

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.370 align:middle line:10%
I haven't had eye surgery--

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:44.930 align:middle line:10%
to all the sacred
geometry that I work with.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:47.990 align:middle line:10%
Crystals for your pineal.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Lapis lazuli and blue
Topaz are very powerful

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:56.830 align:middle line:10%
and also any of the
light yellow stones.

01:10:56.830 --> 01:11:01.240 align:middle line:10%
And aromatherapy, patchouli, and
of course, all the AroMandalas.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So the chant for the
Third Eye is aiy.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.644 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
it with you right now.

01:11:10.644 --> 01:11:11.558 align:middle line:90%
(CHANTING) Aiy.

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:14.300 align:middle line:90%


01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.772 align:middle line:90%
Together.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:16.956 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

01:11:16.956 --> 01:11:17.756 align:middle line:90%
Aiy.

01:11:17.756 --> 01:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%


01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.692 align:middle line:90%
Again.

01:11:22.692 --> 01:11:23.492 align:middle line:90%
Aiy.

01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:29.410 align:middle line:90%


01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:31.872 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:32.672 align:middle line:90%
Aiy.

01:11:32.672 --> 01:11:39.940 align:middle line:90%


01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, the next thing is this
is a freebie on my website.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.550 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Red
Gold Healing Grid.

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was given a
very clear instruction

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to put this around anyone who
was having a physical health

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.910 align:middle line:90%
issue.

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:55.790 align:middle line:10%
You could put it around
an organ in your body.

01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:59.090 align:middle line:10%
And you'll notice the
points actually expand

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:01.140 align:middle line:10%
like a child gait.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.730 align:middle line:10%
So I recommend that
you use this as a tool

01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:06.277 align:middle line:10%
and feel free to take a picture.

01:12:06.277 --> 01:12:08.360 align:middle line:10%
This is one of the most
powerful sacred geometries

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.380 align:middle line:10%
I've worked with.

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's very funny
because my version of it

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:13.130 align:middle line:10%
was very childlike.

01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And I contacted Endre, the man
who did the art for my book

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.970 align:middle line:90%
covers.

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said I made
this cool SG--

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:23.690 align:middle line:84%
he calls them SGs--
sacred geometry today.

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:24.490 align:middle line:90%
You want to see it?

01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.570 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:27.118 align:middle line:90%
And it was just like mine.

01:12:27.118 --> 01:12:28.910 align:middle line:10%
But if you saw the two
together, you'd say,

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:32.000 align:middle line:10%
well, a child did this
one and master did one.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.210 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not showing you mine.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.460 align:middle line:10%
But I did put the
childlike one in the book,

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.130 align:middle line:10%
just to give you a point of
reference to help you see.

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful energy.

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:41.470 align:middle line:90%
Very powerful energy.

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Just pretend that you put
it around whatever it needs.

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, this is
three dimensional, not two.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.680 align:middle line:84%
This sacred geometry is
the cover of the book

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:53.850 align:middle line:90%
that you have been seeing.

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:55.950 align:middle line:10%
This is another
sacred geometry that

01:12:55.950 --> 01:13:03.150 align:middle line:10%
has the star tetradedron
in it and this also.

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are all
sacred geometries

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
that Endre has given
me permission to use.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.730 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, his is
this the most stolen art

01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:13.870 align:middle line:10%
on the internet.

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:16.430 align:middle line:10%
And I think to myself, how
can people who are new age

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:18.560 align:middle line:10%
take a picture like this
just because they found it

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.110 align:middle line:10%
on the internet and put
it in their presentation

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:22.580 align:middle line:10%
without even asking.

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:24.330 align:middle line:10%
You know, I saw his art.

01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Who is this guy?

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:28.180 align:middle line:10%
And I blew up the picture
and found his name in Google

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:28.980 align:middle line:10%
till I found him.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:32.000 align:middle line:10%
And here he's a good
friend of mine now.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Why not make him yours if
you're going to use his art.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I do pay him
for the covers.

01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just doing
it for nothing.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.280 align:middle line:10%
But then he turns
around and says,

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.425 align:middle line:10%
well, you can use these
too, which is pretty cool.

01:13:41.425 --> 01:13:42.550 align:middle line:10%
He's a pretty generous man.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:45.210 align:middle line:10%


01:13:45.210 --> 01:13:47.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, I would like to take the
last few minutes to take you

01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:50.870 align:middle line:10%
through a guided meditation.

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:53.410 align:middle line:10%
And how much time
do we have left?

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:54.555 align:middle line:10%
10 minutes?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:54.970 align:middle line:10%
>> 15.

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:55.460 align:middle line:10%
>> 15?

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.260 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.526 align:middle line:10%
Let's do it.

>> Close your eyes, if you can.

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:13.020 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you can follow
these instructions perfectly,

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.470 align:middle line:10%
even if you do not
understand them.

01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
First, I want you to
turn your attention

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to the great central sun, which
is the sun behind our sun.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The great central sun is
the source of all life.

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Allow a very special
beam of love and light

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:42.720 align:middle line:10%
that will help you activate and
create a healing and cleansing

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.010 align:middle line:10%
and activation of the
glands of the golden bowl.

01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:52.680 align:middle line:10%
And to start this process of
opening up your golden bowl

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.770 align:middle line:10%
as you allow a very
targeted beam coming in

01:14:55.770 --> 01:14:59.340 align:middle line:10%
from the great central sun
and beaming through our sun

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:02.610 align:middle line:10%
directly to you, reaching you.

01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Allow that energy to
move into your heart.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Let it expand your heart.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.560 align:middle line:10%
Let it overflow and bubble up.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.290 align:middle line:10%


01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:17.610 align:middle line:10%
And through and around
your heart chakra,

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:24.900 align:middle line:10%
following a torus formation,
or a donut pattern

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:26.740 align:middle line:10%
around your heart.

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:30.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, as it starts to
circulate around the heart,

01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:33.660 align:middle line:10%
it begins to get bigger and
bigger and more powerful.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:36.300 align:middle line:10%


01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:41.730 align:middle line:10%
It creates a very
sweet surge of energy.

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:43.860 align:middle line:10%
It is a smooth surge.

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:46.680 align:middle line:10%
And now reaches
the throat chakra.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:50.130 align:middle line:10%
It begins to rise to
the center of your brow

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.850 align:middle line:10%
and reaches this
area easily, again,

01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:57.420 align:middle line:10%
through a soft and gentle surge.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.480 align:middle line:10%
Continue to let it rise
in this torus field

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.800 align:middle line:10%
in this special field moving
to yet another torus field

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:08.790 align:middle line:10%
around the body of this
specialized energy that

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:12.600 align:middle line:10%
will activate the golden
bowl sinus cavities.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.840 align:middle line:10%
From your throat
chakra, allow it

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.170 align:middle line:10%
to move into the
area of your sinuses,

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:22.230 align:middle line:10%
which includes your brow.

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:27.090 align:middle line:10%
See that torus field loop
being so big that it easily

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:30.030 align:middle line:10%
reaches the spot
of the Third Eye

01:16:30.030 --> 01:16:35.700 align:middle line:10%
where the center of the golden
bowl sinus cavity exists.

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:43.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, first we are going instruct
and release this energy.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:50.610 align:middle line:10%
Remove, eliminate, dissolve,
and clear all chemicals

01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:56.400 align:middle line:10%
that have held back the
activation of your golden bowl

01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:01.980 align:middle line:10%
of your glands and sinuses
located within the golden bowl.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:09.780 align:middle line:10%
This may include chemicals, such
as fluoride, bromide, chlorine,

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:15.360 align:middle line:10%
or anything else
known or unknown

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:20.160 align:middle line:10%
that could hold back
or adversely affect

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.830 align:middle line:10%
humanity's awakening.

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:26.880 align:middle line:10%
We are clearing the physical
body of all residual thought

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.230 align:middle line:10%
forms.

01:17:28.230 --> 01:17:34.290 align:middle line:10%
Next, we are clearing the mental
body of residual thought forms

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:36.810 align:middle line:10%
that have come with
those chemicals,

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:39.570 align:middle line:10%
and finally, the spiritual body.

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:42.510 align:middle line:10%
We invite that
energy to align fully

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:middle line:10%
with the energy that
is coming to you

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:49.525 align:middle line:10%
from the great central sun and
percolating up from your heart.

01:17:49.525 --> 01:17:55.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, your entire body is being
bathed with this golden energy

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.170 align:middle line:10%
from the great central sun.

01:17:58.170 --> 01:18:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Let it expand again to
the top of your head,

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:04.260 align:middle line:10%
continually bathing
the top of your head

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:08.520 align:middle line:10%
and bathing the entire area
and inviting this energy

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:15.630 align:middle line:10%
to cleanse, clear, and activate
every part of the physical body

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:19.730 align:middle line:10%
needed to support the opening
of these sinus cavities

01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.740 align:middle line:10%
and these glands.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Signal to god's white light.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.840 align:middle line:10%

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:30.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, they are
completely clear.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.490 align:middle line:10%
They are completely clear.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:35.346 align:middle line:10%


01:18:35.346 --> 01:18:39.160 align:middle line:10%
They are completely clear.

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.460 align:middle line:10%
Next, we move on to
the emotional body

01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.610 align:middle line:10%
and clear it of any
residue, thought

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:48.940 align:middle line:10%
forms that have come
from these chemicals that

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.079 align:middle line:10%
are affecting you.

01:18:50.079 --> 01:18:53.572 align:middle line:90%


01:18:53.572 --> 01:18:55.770 align:middle line:10%
Breathe.

01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Breathe in and out.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:00.578 align:middle line:10%
Breathe.

01:19:00.578 --> 01:19:04.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Signal to god's white light.

01:19:04.450 --> 01:19:08.340 align:middle line:10%
Signal to god's white light.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:11.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, they are
completely clear.

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:15.220 align:middle line:10%
One more time we'll repeat the
exercise for the etheric body.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.910 align:middle line:10%


01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:21.490 align:middle line:10%
We are commanding
your divine blueprint,

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:25.690 align:middle line:10%
also known as the genesis
cells, to be fully present

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:28.360 align:middle line:10%
and activated for
use of the higher

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:34.150 align:middle line:10%
purposes of these glands for
the golden bowl and the sinuses.

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:37.180 align:middle line:10%
We are now going to do the
same thing for the clearing

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.930 align:middle line:10%
of pesticides,
fungicides, mercury

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:44.680 align:middle line:10%
from any of these areas,
including anything

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.100 align:middle line:10%
that we may have
ingested from GMO food,

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.310 align:middle line:10%
or anything else we
may have ingested

01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:54.580 align:middle line:10%
that is harmful to the
activation of the golden bowl

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.690 align:middle line:10%
glands.

01:19:55.690 --> 01:20:00.520 align:middle line:10%
We will do this faster since
our body now knows the process.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.770 align:middle line:10%
We allow the energy
to re-emphasize

01:20:02.770 --> 01:20:07.390 align:middle line:10%
the presence of this energy
from the heart emanating

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:09.910 align:middle line:10%
from the great central
sun, going directly

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:13.160 align:middle line:10%
to the throat chakra,
then to the sinuses,

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.880 align:middle line:10%
and then to all the
glands near the sinuses

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.240 align:middle line:10%
cavities that make
up the golden bowl.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.620 align:middle line:10%
Then expanding, make it rise
again to above the head,

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:29.200 align:middle line:10%
keeping that torus formation at
every level, this time clearing

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.120 align:middle line:10%
the entire physical body.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:36.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, the golden torus energy
reaches the entire mental body

01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:41.120 align:middle line:10%
and continues to expand
the entire emotional body.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:43.210 align:middle line:10%
And finally,
expands to encompass

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:46.510 align:middle line:10%
the entire etheric body.

01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Wait.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.560 align:middle line:10%
Wait.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.750 align:middle line:10%
Wait.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.410 align:middle line:10%
Breathe.

01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:58.008 align:middle line:10%
>> Signal to god's white light.

01:20:58.008 --> 01:21:02.056 align:middle line:10%
Signal to god's white light.

01:21:02.056 --> 01:21:05.610 align:middle line:10%
>> We are now going to do this
one more time addressing any

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:10.420 align:middle line:10%
other toxins or thought forms
or influences of any kind,

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:13.110 align:middle line:10%
including mass consciousness.

01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:16.380 align:middle line:10%
Again, you might even see
it rise from your heart

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.380 align:middle line:10%
like a golden ball
emanating outward

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:21.180 align:middle line:10%
in that torus formation.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.700 align:middle line:10%
Starting out at
the heart chakra,

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.780 align:middle line:10%
moving up to the throat chakra,
and then on to the Third Eye

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:31.110 align:middle line:10%
and exploding in an
admission of golden light

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:36.600 align:middle line:10%
in the torus formation rising
up and around the entire body,

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.890 align:middle line:10%
allowing the golden energy to
rise from your heart chakra.

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:46.035 align:middle line:10%
Notice this one pulsation
is quite profound.

01:21:46.035 --> 01:21:48.760 align:middle line:90%


01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.660 align:middle line:90%
Feel it.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:55.100 align:middle line:10%
This one is quite substantial.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.320 align:middle line:10%
You might even see it
rise from your heart

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.320 align:middle line:10%
like a golden ball
emanating outward

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.120 align:middle line:10%
in their torus formation.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.640 align:middle line:10%
Starting out at
the heart chakra,

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.680 align:middle line:10%
moving up to the throat chakra,
and then on to the Third Eye

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and exploding in an
emission of golden light

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:17.660 align:middle line:10%
in the torus formation rising
up and around the entire body.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.390 align:middle line:10%
Again, allowing
the golden energy

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:23.120 align:middle line:10%
to rise from your heart chakra.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.340 align:middle line:10%
You might even see it
rise from your heart

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:28.340 align:middle line:10%
like a golden ball
emanating outward

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.140 align:middle line:10%
in that torus formation.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.660 align:middle line:10%
Starting out at
the heart chakra,

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:36.700 align:middle line:10%
moving up to the throat chakra,
and then on to the Third Eye

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:40.070 align:middle line:10%
and exploding in an
emission of golden light

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:45.990 align:middle line:10%
in the torus formation, rising
up and around the entire body.

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Notice that this pulsation
is quite profound.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:53.120 align:middle line:10%
It may feel or look
like a golden ball.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.800 align:middle line:10%
It is quite substantial.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.610 align:middle line:10%


01:22:57.610 --> 01:23:01.290 align:middle line:10%
This ball starts out
at the heart chakra,

01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:06.960 align:middle line:10%
moving up to the throat chakra,
and then on to the Third Eye,

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:11.970 align:middle line:10%
all the while maintaining
the torus formation.

01:23:11.970 --> 01:23:14.910 align:middle line:10%
As it reaches the
Third Eye, it explodes

01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:18.960 align:middle line:10%
into an emission of
golden light following

01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:25.320 align:middle line:10%
the torus formation rising up
and around your entire body.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Again, allowing
the golden energy

01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:30.600 align:middle line:10%
to rise from your
heart chakra, you

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:32.670 align:middle line:10%
might even see it
rise from your heart

01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.670 align:middle line:10%
like a golden ball
emanating outward

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:37.470 align:middle line:10%
in that torus formation.

01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:39.990 align:middle line:10%
Starting out at
the heart chakra,

01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:44.070 align:middle line:10%
moving up to the throat chakra,
and then on to the Third Eye

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:47.430 align:middle line:10%
and exploding in an
emission of golden light

01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:53.620 align:middle line:10%
in the torus formation, rising
up and around the entire body.

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.240 align:middle line:10%
Notice that this pulsation
is quite profound.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.630 align:middle line:10%
It may feel or look
like a golden ball.

01:24:00.630 --> 01:24:03.540 align:middle line:10%
As it reaches the
Third Eye, it explodes

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:07.620 align:middle line:10%
into an emission of
golden light following

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:14.070 align:middle line:10%
the torus formation, rising up
and around your entire body.

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:20.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, allow yourself to drift
back into your awareness

01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:24.960 align:middle line:10%
away from everything that
has to do with your day

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.040 align:middle line:10%
to day troubles or concerns.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.220 align:middle line:10%
Announce yourself
out loud, repeating

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:38.400 align:middle line:10%
after me, either in your thought
or out loud, saying it out loud

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.400 align:middle line:10%
is preferable.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.730 align:middle line:10%
I am--

01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:43.530 align:middle line:10%
I am.

01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:47.600 align:middle line:10%
--tapping into my
higher consciousness.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Higher consciousness.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.220 align:middle line:10%
My higher intelligence.

01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:53.820 align:middle line:10%
My higher intelligence.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.180 align:middle line:10%
And my higher self.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.620 align:middle line:10%
And my higher self.
