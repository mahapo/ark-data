[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Good evening.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Well, afternoon.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.410 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed early, so
for me, it's the evening.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So OK so, I want to get
started with you guys.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:10%
I want to tell you a little
bit about what it is that I do.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.820 align:middle line:10%
And I also want to give you
three tips about connecting

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.049 align:middle line:10%
with loved ones based on things
that I've learned that people

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.700 align:middle line:10%
struggle with, misconceptions
that people have.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you a
little bit about me.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.617 align:middle line:10%
And then the rest
of the time, I'm

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:10%
just going to spend time
doing readings and just

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:10%
picking people that
would like a reading

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:10%
and see what comes through
for them and stuff.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So and what I am
going to do also

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.660 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to pass
around this notebook.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you could just throw
your email address in there,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to send
you a free gift.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:10%
It's actually an
MP3 of a meditation

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:10%
that I have that's
in my voice and it's

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:10%
for you to connect
with your loved ones.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm also going to
pick one person

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:90%
to get a short session with me.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
put your email.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I put the pen in where
to start, just put

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:90%
your email address down.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:10%
And then I will send
you your free gift.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:10%
And you can just kind
of pass that around.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.940 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to don't
waste your time putting

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
like your name or anything.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.442 align:middle line:90%
I just need your email address.

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
So and I will, if
it's OK with you,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I will add your email
to my newsletter.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
want that, then just

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.120 align:middle line:84%
don't throw your
email down there.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:10%
OK, so and following
this also, right at 1:30

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:10%
when we wrap up here, I am
going to have a book signing.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Some people were coming up to me
asking about copies of my book.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.557 align:middle line:84%
So I did bring some
copies of my book.

00:01:58.557 --> 00:01:59.390 align:middle line:90%
And I will be there.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.057 align:middle line:84%
It's just down the
hall in the four way.

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can kind of find
where I'm going to be.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be there for
a little bit after this

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:90%
if you'd like to join me.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So I want to tell you
a little bit about me,

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and then I want to
give you, like I said,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
three practical tips.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:10%
And then I also want
to just get right

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:10%
into the readings and stuff.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.170 align:middle line:10%
So my work is really
focused on mediumship,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090 align:middle line:10%
evidential mediumship, which
is me opening myself up

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:10%
as a recipient and as a
channel to receiving messages

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:10%
from loved ones, OK, so people
that have passed away that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:10%
want to communicate with you.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, these are
people that you were close to.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
They could be friends,
family members.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I even do pick up
messages from people's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:84%
pets, dogs, cats, other pets I
guess too, but not as common.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.760 align:middle line:84%
But my focus is
really on mediumship

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with the
spirit world in that way.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I also work psychically
with people and work

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:90%
with people's energy.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So basically, as we're all
here, we all see, everybody

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:90%
sees everybody's physical body.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But I can also see
the energy body.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I can see your aura,
things like that.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I use that
ability to perceive

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.980 align:middle line:84%
those things to give guidance
and insight about past,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.210 align:middle line:90%
present, future.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
But in the last
five years, my work

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.020 align:middle line:84%
has really become a little bit
more focused on the mediumship.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I teach about.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I really teach people how
to communicate with your loved

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
ones, how to make that
a two-way conversation,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:84%
how to enhance the
connection that we all have.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So because what I tell people
in my workshops and in my events

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.820 align:middle line:84%
and my readings is
everybody is a medium.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
go and see a medium

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.653 align:middle line:90%
to speak with your loved ones.

00:03:51.653 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I usually tell people
that after they've

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:90%
paid for their sessions.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But just to tell you
that is that everybody

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:90%
has that real connection.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Now all kidding
aside, there is just

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:84%
the experience of having
a medium work with you.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We all need a little help,
guidance, experts to help us.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
when we're focusing

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.589 align:middle line:90%
on our physical fitness, right?

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
our own commitment

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to that and the things that
we do in our daily life.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But you also might work
with a dietician or a health

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
coach or a personal trainer.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Those people are there to
help and aid in the connection

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and make it go a
little bit deeper.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's really what
my work as a medium is.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
When people come to
me, it's for them

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
to receive a session of
communicating with their loved

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.100 align:middle line:90%
ones.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that
happen here today

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:84%
when I bring through
messages from loved ones.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So I actually have had
this ability basically

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:90%
since I was born.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So I don't really
have any recollection

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.780 align:middle line:90%
of not having this.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%
I've always had this ability.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I believe I was born this way.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, we all
have it in us to an extent.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Just it matters how
much we open up to it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
or how much we trust it.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.917 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about
that in a little bit

00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:13.250 align:middle line:90%
before we get into the readings.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But I was basically
born this way.

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
And nobody in my family had any
sort of connection with this.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like I grew up in
a family where people talked

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.540 align:middle line:90%
about psychics or mediums.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in a very
traditional sort

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of conservative Irish
Catholic type of family.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:84%
I always jokingly say I grew
up in a town called Plainville.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
what that was like.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So basically, this
wasn't something

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.840 align:middle line:90%
that was talked about.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.840 align:middle line:84%
I had never heard the
word psychic or medium.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
different paths to this.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.070 align:middle line:84%
But my path was such
that I didn't have that.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
is as I began

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
to share these impressions,
these visitations,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
mostly around my grandfather
who was visiting me,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
who I never knew in life, and
he was visiting me and giving me

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.420 align:middle line:84%
messages to give to my relatives
and especially my mom and dad.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And this was very
scary for my family.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:84%
They thought, you know
especially my parents,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they thought that
something was wrong with me.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.150 align:middle line:90%
They did not understand this.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
They had no context
to put it in.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And basically, the
family that I grew up in,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't like a
supportive environment

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
for this type of thing.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And it was even
to the point where

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
it would make my dad angry,
and he would become violent.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a very
unsafe place to grow up.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So by the time I was
six or seven years old,

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I really learned
that, well, I can't

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:84%
talk about this, because
there's no way for me to.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'd talk about
it, there's screaming.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
There's fighting.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:90%
There's arguing.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
So I kind of shut it off.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say I didn't
have those experiences still,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.760 align:middle line:90%
because I did.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But I just chose
to not share them.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
those things where

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
the more you do foster the
connection with the spirit

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
world, the more it enhances and
it does kind of build on that.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you really kind of
focusing on tuning it out,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
develop as strongly as it

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:90%
would if you practiced with it.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.520 align:middle line:84%
So it really kind
of did dim for me.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.615 align:middle line:84%
And I never thought when I
was going through my life

00:07:31.615 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to be a
psychic or a medium or anything.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't even in my
language of thinking.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And so, that was
how my life was.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I ended up
graduating from high school.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:90%
I went to college.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I went to the
University of Chicago.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was studying premed.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And I was on this whole
other path in life.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And I started to become more
just aware of myself, things

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
develop in myself,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
who I was as a person,
my personal beliefs,

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.863 align:middle line:84%
And this was a part of myself
that I felt like maybe I should

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:90%
deal with this a little bit.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I need to
understand this more.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Felt like it continued
to come up and stuff.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
what happened for me

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is that I started to take
just little things like I

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
would take meditation workshops,
just dabbling in things.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And I still was not really-- and
I also I wanted to really see,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:90%
is this a real thing?

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
read books about it.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:84%
But again, never really
pursuing it at all.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
was to the point

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
where it was still very
overwhelming to me.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
because I feel

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.390 align:middle line:84%
like, I get so many questions
from people that say,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm
supposed to have gifts.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:90%
I have gifts.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
How do I develop them?

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:84%
How do I know if I'm
supposed to develop them?

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always kind of
jokingly say, you know,

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the spirit world, they're
kind of like the mafia.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.150 align:middle line:84%
If they want to recruit
you in, you will not really

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:90%
have a choice in the matter.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So they will
basically, these doors

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:90%
will continue to open for you.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was like me.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm probably the prime example.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I did everything
in my human power

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to run the opposite
direction from God.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I went to the most atheist
school for college.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I was on a premed track.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I did every profession
possible between 21 and 24

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%
to develop in other areas.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:90%
I was in research departments.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I worked at Yale University
for a year and a half,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.180 align:middle line:84%
actually, doing
neuroscience research.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:90%
I worked in restaurants.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I worked in bars.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:90%
I worked in nightclubs.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
I was actually a drag queen
for a year, believe it or not.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:90%
So I know.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I haven't dabbled
in that in a while.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So I basically was pursuing
anything humanly possible

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
to not develop my gift.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.135 align:middle line:90%
And this still opened up for me.

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, as you
know, and obviously, it's

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
not in everybody's path
or destiny or purpose

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to be a medium or
to be an intuitive

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But we all have
gifts to develop.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
moral of the story

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
is I think one thing
for me that I learned

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is that I have a whole team of
people that want to support me

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:90%
in developing this.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:90%
I have my angels.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I have my ancestors, my
guides, my spirit guides,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:90%
my loved ones in spirit.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are your team to
help you and to develop this.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
So just know that
even if you you're

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.708 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship and
your partner is like,

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't know
about any of that,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
or you can't find
like-minded people,

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
just know that we
all have a team.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're always
being divinely guided.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And so at an eventual
point, I started

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.590 align:middle line:84%
to dabble and get
readings myself.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would get this
recurring message.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
That's another thing
with the spirit world.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
They will continue
to send that message

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
through until you hear it.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I got told so
many times, you're

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:90%
supposed to do this work.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to be.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.690 align:middle line:84%
And so I just over time
kept getting led to,

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, this is what
I'm supposed to do.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So I want to give you guys for
your own path of connecting

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:84%
with loved ones, because I
would imagine that, like I said,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:90%
that's my focus.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And I imagine a lot of
people have questions

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:90%
about their own loved ones.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.740 align:middle line:84%
How can they connect
with their loved ones?

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
How do they know if
they're receiving

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:90%
a message from a loved one?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.963 align:middle line:84%
Dreams, signs, feeling
their loved ones around.

00:11:39.963 --> 00:11:41.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't feel their
loved ones around.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.260 align:middle line:90%
How come they don't?

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.720 align:middle line:84%
All these various questions
that get asked to me.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
So there's three things.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I can probably give you 20,
but I decided to keep it brief.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with three
things that can really

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:84%
help you to think about and
you can kind of translate these

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.225 align:middle line:84%
into little tips to
make a deeper connection

00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:90%
with your loved ones.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, we all have
loved ones and spirit guides.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But I'm talking about
loved ones, people

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
that we had a
relationship with here,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.660 align:middle line:84%
even people that we
didn't know here.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:84%
There might be people
here in the audience

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.210 align:middle line:90%
that didn't know their family.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they didn't know
their biological family,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Those people can still
be connected to us.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
So one tip and one thing
I find is do not compare

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
your experience with your
loved ones to other people's.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I have this happen a
lot where people will say, well,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
so-and-so, she always
gets this type of dream.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Or my friend so-and-so, she
gets pennies all the time

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:90%
from her husband.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Just know that the communication
between our loved ones and you

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:90%
is unique to every relationship.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
So you're not going to
have the same experience

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that somebody else may have.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Your communications
may be differently.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It may be through your thoughts.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It may be through just
through a feeling.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's always interesting
to hear about experiences.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:90%
But don't compare in that way.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Don't make it that, well,
you're not getting that.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Because by doing that,
you're really shutting down

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:90%
the communication.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're really limiting the
potential for the loved one

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to communicate in the
way that they choose

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and the way that they want
to communicate with you.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:90%
So that would be one thing.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.990 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I would tell
you that's really important

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
is to be available
to the spirit world.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
You need to be available
to have this relationship.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.210 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world where
there's constant distraction.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly distracted by
technology, by this, by that,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%
by just the demands of our
society that we live in.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're here trying to have
this physical body existence.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it gets
very distracting.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's
hard for those

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
loved ones in spirit that
are on this higher vibration

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.680 align:middle line:90%
to come through.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%
But you need to be available.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
You also by being
available, you need

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
to understand that
the way people connect

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
with us in the
spiritual world can

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and will often be different
than how they communicated

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and connected with us here.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:27.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, OK, my
dad, for example,

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:90%
passed away a few months ago.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%
I was not close to him.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't speak to him for the
last 15, 20 years of his life.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was not a
good person in life.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.230 align:middle line:84%
He died alone in a prison
cell in Massachusetts.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And we hadn't talked to
him in 15 or 20 years.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Since he's gone to
the spirit world,

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:55.320 align:middle line:84%
he has come through in
so many different ways.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I have gotten countless
messages from him.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
My friends who are
mediums are like, OK,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:90%
your dad's contacting me now.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.830 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:84%
He's more present now than
he was when he was here.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And what you need to
understand is that does happen.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:90%
That does happen.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So when I read for
somebody, and somebody

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.920 align:middle line:84%
is like, well, I don't
really, you know, that person,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like them here.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Just know that they're stepping
forward and coming through,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't take away
the pain of the situation.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take away
the sadness or the

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
what could have been
in that relationship

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But just know that
there is the potential

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.850 align:middle line:84%
for growth and evolution
on the other side.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:84%
People just don't stay
in their stagnant energy

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:90%
that they were here.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:90%
They grow.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:90%
They learn.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
They evolve.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of
going to the other side.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So you need to be
open to that in order

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.838 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and
connect with those

00:15:51.838 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
who want to come through to you
and want to connect with you.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:84%
You need to understand
that that relationship can

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:90%
shift and change.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, be
available, meditation,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
prayer, asking your loved
ones to be with you, being

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.590 align:middle line:90%
open to signs and symbols.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
If your energy is very
chaotic, and sort of you know,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.820 align:middle line:84%
it is going to repel your
loved ones to connect with you.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:90%
So like I said, don't compare.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Be available.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the third thing
is also have faith.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by this is it's
very easy, even for the most,

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
I assume by
everybody being here,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
you probably are very
open minded people.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You probably are believers
in this type of thing,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.580 align:middle line:90%
or most of you are.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.000 align:middle line:84%
You're probably more open
minded than the average group

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that I talk in front of.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
That being said, OK, you need
to understand that we all

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:84%
have a natural skepticism,
a natural mindset that we

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:90%
can slip into.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's really, really
important that, I mean,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I do this work for a
living, and sometimes

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:90%
I second guess myself.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I question myself.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think about, OK,
is this in my imagination

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:90%
or is this real?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So just know when you're
connecting with your loved

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
ones, when you're
on this path, you're

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.040 align:middle line:84%
going to have those moments
of doubting yourself.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.170 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
those moments of, well,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't really know if
these people are really.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.865 align:middle line:84%
Are they really still
connecting to me?

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Is this in my mind?

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:90%
Is this in my imagination?

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.670 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
those natural doubts.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I would say is
try to have faith though.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
Try to keep yourself open
in your heart chakra area.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Try to just be open, because
there's that gravitational pull

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of the energy of
the world that's

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
going to try to pull you
back to the mindset of being

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more closed.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
That's going to
happen all the time.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I have this happen a lot when
I do readings for people.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:84%
People will have
an hour reading.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they've gotten
a lot of clarity, guidance,

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:90%
insight.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:84%
They feel very connected
to their loved ones.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.630 align:middle line:84%
They feel like they're
on the right path.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.510 align:middle line:90%
They feel lighter.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:90%
They go back out.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.840 align:middle line:84%
In a couple of weeks,
they're off their path again.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.220 align:middle line:90%
They start to question things.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:20.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have to, it's
your job in your energy

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
to hold that vibration and to
really hold that and keep that

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.568 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:26.568 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get
started with some readings,

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and basically we'll do that
the rest of the time together.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:90%
it is that I read.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And then what we'll do is
we'll set an intention.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
connect with loved ones.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll start to bring
things through.

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So what's going to
happen here in a second

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.140 align:middle line:84%
is I'm going to open myself
up to the spirit world.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask
them to step forward.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask
them to be with us here.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to ask them to
identify themselves and bring

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:90%
through messages.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
In the interest of
time, this is not

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.733 align:middle line:84%
going to be a private
reading for you.

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
message, and then I'm

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.047 align:middle line:84%
going to move on
to the next person.

00:19:03.047 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd like to get through
several people rather than one

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.620 align:middle line:84%
So just know if I leave
you, if I shift from you,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
I could even maybe
come back to you.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is please listen
and validate the information.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
So for example-- was that a
little cat that walked by?

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:90%
What was that?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, a dog.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.607 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:24.607 --> 00:19:26.440 align:middle line:84%
I was like, am I already
seeing dead things?

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:90%
So that's fine.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.180 align:middle line:90%
So anyways.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.927 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm connecting and
when I'm seeing things,

00:19:40.927 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to, like I said,
I'll make a connection.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:90%
I'll move on.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thing
that I can tell

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.090 align:middle line:84%
you is take a deep
breath, relax,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and just please for the
interest of everybody

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.740 align:middle line:84%
here, if you recognize
the information

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.113 align:middle line:84%
and it really resonates
and I say five things,

00:19:58.113 --> 00:19:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and you can take
definitely four of them

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.120 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the fifth,
please let me know,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
make these connections.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.950 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is so I need
to know where I am with this.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, I will know
exactly in the room where I am.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:90%
I may not though.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.770 align:middle line:90%
So just listen.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.860 align:middle line:90%
Hear the information.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you can validate
it, please let me know.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Because that way, we can make
the connection and go forward.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.620 align:middle line:84%
It it's always kind of,
when people just like,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it is,
they get scared or nervous.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's like I'm saying things,
and it's clearly their loved

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:36.137 align:middle line:84%
one, and they're looking at me
like I just landed a spaceship

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the room.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, I
don't understand it,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
because you came here
to talk to dead people.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So that is what
is going on here.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're here to do.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So unless you're in the
wrong room or something,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going on here.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.770 align:middle line:84%
So these messages
that come through,

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.070 align:middle line:84%
there's always going to be
one or two things that you

00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:90%
might not be able to take.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
But you should be able
to take the primary part

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
of the reading.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.767 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
want to tell you

00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
too is, when I'm
delivering a message,

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
on the flip side
of it, I know it's

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:90%
like everybody wants a message.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Try to not-- we can't
make things work.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We can't have dead
women become dead men.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.330 align:middle line:84%
We can't have fathers become
your great uncle's neighbors

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:90%
cat.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.520 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really stick
with the information that's

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:28.950 align:middle line:90%
come through.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:84%
So if I say I've got a
mother figure coming through,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and this is her name,
and this is what she did,

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:90%
then that's what it has to be.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
We can't say, well,
that wasn't my mother.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.010 align:middle line:90%
It was my neighbor.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.810 align:middle line:84%
That's not what we're
connecting with here.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.085 align:middle line:84%
So just really listen
through the information,

00:21:45.085 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
really hear the
things, and we'll

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
try to validate things
and get the messages

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and move on to the next person.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like everybody, let's
kind of set a little intention

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:55.593 align:middle line:90%
here in the room.

00:21:55.593 --> 00:21:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So let's have everybody close
their eyes and take a couple

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:90%
deep breaths.

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself to
a peaceful place.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Now's a great time to take
a couple deep breaths.

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Again relax.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'd like you to bring
yourself to a peaceful place.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:84%
This can be a place
that's real or imagined,

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
but really bring yourself
into a peaceful place.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
this peaceful place,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.160 align:middle line:84%
invite in those in spirit
that you'd like to connect to.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:84%
OK, so maybe
there's a loved one.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're going
through a situation

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.960 align:middle line:90%
and you need guidance on it.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
Now's a great time to
just put that out there.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:90%
Take a deep breath in.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.980 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.895 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:56.895 --> 00:22:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's have a good
thought for everybody

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:84%
here that people hear from
who they need to hear from.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready, you can
come back here into the room.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to get started.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We do have that second
microphone, right?

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:90%
We can-- OK, great.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:90%
So this lady will come through.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And she'll bring the microphone
to you as I make a connection.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have three
people coming through.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And what I kind of feel like
is first one we link in with,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
we'll do that.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll go to the
next two people after that.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So I want to just
say first off is I

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.230 align:middle line:84%
a very strong
connection, I believe

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:84%
this is somebody's
husband as I'm

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:90%
connecting with this person.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I want to put this in
the realm of husband,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:52.270 align:middle line:90%
could be fiance, boyfriend.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.940 align:middle line:84%
It's somebody that is a
relationship person that's

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
coming through, male energy.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
When I'm connecting with this
person also I want to say,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm hearing
the name Marsha.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Marsha, Marsha, I
keep hearing that.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I felt like maybe this is
who this person's trying

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:11.810 align:middle line:90%
to contact.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.185 align:middle line:84%
You're already
raising your hand?

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Marcia, but a
lot of people call me Marsha.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:90%
Is your husband passed?

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Come down here, please, because
I can get more validations

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.830 align:middle line:90%
and then we can say.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.987 align:middle line:90%
Could very much be for you.

00:24:22.987 --> 00:24:24.320 align:middle line:90%
You can stay in your seat, dear.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So hold on one second,
because I'm not sure

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
if I'm with you just
yet, but it kind of feels

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.930 align:middle line:90%
like there could be something.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.210 align:middle line:84%
I also want to say
to you, can you

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:84%
connect with a father
in spirit that's

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:90%
showing me Christmas December?

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a birthday
or anniversary

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.000 align:middle line:90%
has to do with December.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this is-- yeah,
speak into the mic, dear.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:84%
So and is this your
father, because I

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
feel your dad's coming
through and showing me

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.880 align:middle line:90%
December, December, Christmas.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.755 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:25:00.755 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
My dad died the day
after Christmas.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
So I feel this is his
way of coming through.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work on
the energy a little bit.

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like this is dad
and then also your husband.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:90%
So hold on one second.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So your husband is showing
me a tremendous amount

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.720 align:middle line:84%
of confusion in his mind
prior to his passing.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:84%
He wants to give me the
feeling of either Alzheimer's

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
or dementia.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.720 align:middle line:90%
He had dementia.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how he's
coming through to me.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And he wants you
to know that where

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.560 align:middle line:84%
he's at in the spirit world,
he doesn't have that anymore.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't have that anymore.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually talking about
you very much being a caretaker

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.370 align:middle line:90%
for him, taking care of him.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
He wants to just send
appreciation to you for this.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So did you sort of take care
of him prior to his passing?

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.620 align:middle line:90%
Were you taking care of him?

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I took care of him at
home for eight years.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So he just wants
to validate that.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like he's bringing
through just gratitude.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
But he wants to talk
about also, this

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.610 align:middle line:84%
is another thing I'm
hearing, he wants

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.810 align:middle line:84%
to talk about being with
you in your physical life

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.530 align:middle line:84%
even though you
guys are separated.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So he's letting me know to tell
you even though he's in spirit,

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
physical world,

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.150 align:middle line:84%
he's still very much
connected to you.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:84%
How do you connect to
the trip to Arizona?

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I just got back from there.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So he's again, he's probably
just saying, I'm with you.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, he's talking
about, like I said,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the message was,
I want you to know

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.270 align:middle line:84%
that even though I'm
in the physical world,

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I still am connected to you.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Even though I'm in
the spirit world,

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm still connected to your
life in the physical world.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.060 align:middle line:84%
He's also talking about
a period of misdiagnosis

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:90%
prior to his illness.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like there must have
been things where we weren't

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:90%
quite sure what was going on.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about being
fatigued, being sleepy,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:84%
like you knew something
was different,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't know specifically
what was wrong with him.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.857 align:middle line:84%
And then it kind of
got to this place.

00:26:59.857 --> 00:27:01.190 align:middle line:90%
But that's what he's showing me.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:02.000 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:90%
He slept all the time.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Years before
he was diagnosed.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Because he's kind of showing
me some of this, who knows,

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
may have been starting to
develop in his body and things

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:12.470 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about this also
as I'm connecting with this.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it's
very possible you may not

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:90%
understand everything.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:10%
But you're doing a
great job so far.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:10%
I do want to talk about the
multiple military branches

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:10%
connected to one person.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:10%
So I want to say it's like
I almost feel like this

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:32.360 align:middle line:10%
is coming through from dad.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:10%
But I definitely want to
bring through military stuff

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.710 align:middle line:10%
with your father.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
But I want to talk about did
he serve in I don't know.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Did he?

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he was in the
Navy and the Air Force.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the way
he's coming through.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say he's
actually a spirit that I feel

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.820 align:middle line:90%
is he's very protective of you.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.950 align:middle line:90%
He watches over you a lot.

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I feel both of these
gentlemen really do.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I just want to tell you too,
because they are telling me

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:10%
this, they're
communicating to me

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.620 align:middle line:10%
that there's just been a lot
of, the last couple of years

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:10%
have really not
been easy for you.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.850 align:middle line:10%
And I feel like they're
talking about just

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:10%
you're adjusting with things.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:10%
And I just want you to know
that in the spirit world,

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.970 align:middle line:10%
there's a tremendous amount
of pride from your husband

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:26.930 align:middle line:10%
and from your father that they
really want to say to you,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:27.930 align:middle line:10%
you're doing a good job.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.730 align:middle line:10%
You're doing it.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:10%
We know it's not
easy all the time,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.520 align:middle line:10%
but you are doing a good job.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:10%
Hold on one second.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Can I tell you when I'm
connecting here also?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.078 align:middle line:10%
I'm not really good with breeds.

00:28:38.078 --> 00:28:39.870 align:middle line:10%
But there's just a
couple more things here.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:10%
There is a larger dog
with your husband.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.120 align:middle line:84%
So did you guys have
a large black dog?

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:45.580 align:middle line:90%
>> We did.

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:90%
Australian shepherd.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I see a large black
dog with your husband.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.460 align:middle line:10%
And I just want to tell you
this came through to me,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:10%
and it's almost like I feel
if you don't connect with it,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.890 align:middle line:10%
it's OK.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.030 align:middle line:10%
It could be, but
I don't know why.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:10%
Your husband keeps showing
me the movie "Shrek."

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.340 align:middle line:10%
I don't know why.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Is there a reason?

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Did he like that movie, or
does it mean something to you?

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not really.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:15.830 align:middle line:10%
So for some reason, I'm seeing
that green, that Shrek guy.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.750 align:middle line:10%
So I'm not really sure.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.640 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's sometimes
the information

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:10%
comes through so fast,
and it could be something

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.420 align:middle line:10%
that you could make sense of
later or something like that.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:26.422 align:middle line:10%
So just put that away.

00:29:26.422 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:10%
I feel like so many
other things that you

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.510 align:middle line:10%
connected with that make sense.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll go watch it.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:10%
Right.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to say
though, but yeah, I

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:10%
want to talk about this too.

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Can you take this
with your husband

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.180 align:middle line:10%
that he's talking about
new friends in your life?

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.870 align:middle line:10%
Are you trying to make new
friends, new connections,

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:10%
or reconnecting
with old friends?

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm trying to make
a lot of new friends.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> New friends, yeah.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:52.220 align:middle line:10%
So I just want to
say, because he's

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:10%
talking about how much time
and energy was spent with this,

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:10%
so I want to say when
I'm connecting with him,

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:10%
he's letting me know
that he's allowing.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:10%
We have our own free
will and our own path

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:10%
that we need to deal with.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:10%
But I want to say he's
telling me that he's allowing,

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.367 align:middle line:10%
he's trying to guide you toward,
not allowing, that's not really

00:30:19.367 --> 00:30:21.200 align:middle line:10%
the right word, but
he's trying to guide you

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.030 align:middle line:10%
toward those
opportunities, guide you

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.247 align:middle line:10%
towards people that
you can connect with,

00:30:25.247 --> 00:30:26.330 align:middle line:10%
people that you can trust.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.750 align:middle line:10%
Because I feel like he
wants this for you so.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.800 align:middle line:10%
OK, so that feels
that I got that.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.030 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.905 align:middle line:10%
Let's everybody give
her a round of applause.

00:30:36.905 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:90%
That was very nice.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And that she was
the first person.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.400 align:middle line:10%
Let's just move real quick,
because I want to just--

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.990 align:middle line:10%
can I ask you as I'm
connecting with you,

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:10%
do you have the
brother in spirit?

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.730 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't think, your
brother isn't passed here,

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:10%
is he?

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.490 align:middle line:10%
Back with you.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:53.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Me?

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:10%
I don't have any brothers.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.360 align:middle line:84%
See, I kind of thought
maybe I was leaving you.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of made me
feel like I'm leaving you.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.380 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So I've got two
brothers coming through.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They're not for the
same person though.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But there are two
brother energies.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
parallel people,

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:90%
they'll come through together.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.892 align:middle line:84%
So we got to find
kind of both these.

00:31:12.892 --> 00:31:14.930 align:middle line:84%
If we find one,
we'll go with that.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
to the next person.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So I have a brother
that's coming

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
through that had a
tremendous difficulty walking

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.660 align:middle line:90%
at the end of his life.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I almost wanted to say
I feel with this man

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that he had maybe like
Parkinson's or maybe something

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.230 align:middle line:84%
like an almost like a
neurobiological thing

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.380 align:middle line:90%
where he couldn't really walk.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that his walking
was very limited.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And then I have another
gentleman that I want to link,

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.490 align:middle line:84%
I think I want to link
this person in this sort

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:90%
of middle section here.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's just go back
there one second.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got another person's
brother coming through.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I just I do feel like I know I'm
towards the back with this guy.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.460 align:middle line:84%
So I've got another
person's brother.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.864 align:middle line:84%
I think this gentleman
died with a heart attack.

00:32:16.864 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it could be this.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:20.440 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:90%
But I'm let me just see here.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.950 align:middle line:90%
John?

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:23.750 align:middle line:90%
John.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes, dear?

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Do you have John?

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the brother, though?

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So but this you
weren't the person

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I was getting with the
neurobiological thing.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That maybe could
be for you guys.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.142 align:middle line:84%
And you guys are kind of
sitting near each other.

00:32:42.142 --> 00:32:44.288 align:middle line:90%
So let's do you.

00:32:44.288 --> 00:32:46.705 align:middle line:84%
And then since we're already
with you, if we are with you,

00:32:46.705 --> 00:32:50.960 align:middle line:84%
it feels like we are, and
then we'll do the next person.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%
So interesting.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:57.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:06.625 align:middle line:84%
I want to just say as I'm
here too, I'm aware of also,

00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:08.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
stay with yeah.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's just stay with this.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So did your brother
have heart issues?

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.920 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm getting
like there was either

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.770 align:middle line:84%
like an obstruction in the
heart or he had heart issues.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:23.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Would you understand him
talking about a family of three?

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Because he's talking
about a family of three.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this means
you guys are one of three.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But he's talking
about a family of three.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.527 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold on one second.

00:33:39.527 --> 00:33:59.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:90%
There's a second man coming in.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't know
who this person is,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:90%
but there's a second man.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe the reason I went
to you is because of a husband.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.639 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I have a lot of
things that resonate.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.270 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there
is a parallel thing.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.679 align:middle line:84%
I have to tell
you there's always

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:16.400 align:middle line:90%
themes when I do this stuff.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are for
some reason a lot

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of, which is kind of unusual, a
lot of significant others here,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.139 align:middle line:90%
so her, yours.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.963 align:middle line:84%
There is another one
that I'm aware of too

00:34:24.963 --> 00:34:27.130 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to want to
connect with at some point

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:90%
soon.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
That will probably
be my next reading.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to know
there's somebody else.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:33.909 align:middle line:84%
There's another
significant person

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.800 align:middle line:84%
here too that I'm getting,
a lover, husband, husband.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, this person's a husband.

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've got your
husband, and then we've

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.389 align:middle line:84%
got this other woman's
husband that I'm not

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.347 align:middle line:84%
going to put with you
because not your husband.

00:34:45.347 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.662 align:middle line:90%
So your husband's come through.

00:34:52.662 --> 00:34:54.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of
building up, because I'm

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.930 align:middle line:84%
going to go into the next
stage of what they're here

00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:57.730 align:middle line:90%
to talk about.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.170 align:middle line:84%
But do you understand
about the two daughters?

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Our two daughters.

00:35:02.105 --> 00:35:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> With your husband?

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, perfect.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:04.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So we're connecting
good with him.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Now would you also
understand with your husband

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that I feel very much in
the physical world and then

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.210 align:middle line:90%
a very quick passing.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand broken
bones when he passes or broken

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know a broken bone?

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> He lacerated his spleen.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt like there
was some sort of impact,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:90%
like a falling thing.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like it's
like something cracked

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.270 align:middle line:90%
or something snapped.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But he is talking about
falling or something.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.183 align:middle line:90%
>> He fell off of a horse.

00:35:40.183 --> 00:35:40.983 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:40.983 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
something is like, you know,

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.840 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm getting.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.560 align:middle line:90%
So he's here too.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:84%
He's laughing
because he said, it

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:84%
was kind of like you had
three kids with him included.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.182 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:35:59.182 --> 00:36:00.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, you really you
technically had two daughters

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and a grown up boy.

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:90%


00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like he's showing
me that part of the reason you

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.940 align:middle line:84%
were really drawn to him is
because he was fun and he had

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.510 align:middle line:90%
kind of an outgoing personality.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:84%
But I do get a sense, and he's
acknowledging this, a sense

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.020 align:middle line:90%
of frustration with him.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me the
feeling that, I almost

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.780 align:middle line:84%
feel like there could be
like an alcoholism thing.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:90%
He was an alcoholic.

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Because he's showing me
like that side of things

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.220 align:middle line:84%
was like it's very painful
for you to deal with

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.360 align:middle line:90%
and the over and the over.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And he's showing me
the alcoholism thing.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I can sense at his heart
center and at a soul level,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:90%
he's a very good person.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And I know that he loved you.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.810 align:middle line:84%
But he does show me that this
illness really got in the way.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's even telling
me towards the end,

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.915 align:middle line:84%
you were getting to the point
of, OK, if this doesn't change,

00:37:06.915 --> 00:37:08.790 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to
make some big changes.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.450 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was divorcing him.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So he's just he is
bringing that through.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you,
when I connect with him,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
do you understand the
financial confusion prior?

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I almost feel like
did his passing cause,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:90%
or is this more your brother?

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.140 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my brother,
the financial.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:32.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
somebody is talking

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:90%
about financial confusion.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my brother.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So when your brother passes,
it's almost like there were

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:84%
things you were supposed
to get financially.

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:48.913 align:middle line:90%
My sister was the trustee.

00:37:48.913 --> 00:37:49.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:49.713 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:90%
There's financial disputes.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.590 align:middle line:84%
That must be more
your brother then.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Because he's making
me feel, it's

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:84%
interesting with your brother,
because I feel with him when

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I connect with him,
I don't know if he's

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.980 align:middle line:84%
older than you or
younger than you,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:84%
but he feels very
protective of you.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Like he would be the type
that would always checking

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.540 align:middle line:84%
in on you, always
making sure, you OK?

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Older brother, and I
didn't grow up with my dad.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.562 align:middle line:84%
And it's funny, because
he's coming through

00:38:16.562 --> 00:38:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and he's got a wad
of cash in his hand.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I feel like he's
like, here, take $100.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.390 align:middle line:84%
You know, or
something like that?

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.540 align:middle line:90%
He helped everybody.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:90%
He's just got that personality.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.030 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:28.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:29.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold on one second.

00:38:29.747 --> 00:38:30.547 align:middle line:90%
He's laughing.

00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, it's party time.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo hoo.

00:38:33.126 --> 00:38:36.570 align:middle line:90%


00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel with him--
hold on one second.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:90%


00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I do want to bring
this through too.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.040 align:middle line:84%
I got the two men
coming through.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.307 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.070 align:middle line:84%
They're making me
feel that there's

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.050 align:middle line:90%
a lot of stress around you.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Hold on one second.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.275 align:middle line:90%
And do you have Thomas?

00:39:09.275 --> 00:39:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my husband.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing Thomas,
Thomas, Thomas.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So they're talking
about this here.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Let me just kind of give you,
so what are they talking about?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:22.810 align:middle line:90%
So huh.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you in talks like you're
not talking to a bank are you?

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.860 align:middle line:84%
I just I was having
some financial issues

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.770 align:middle line:90%
and just refinanced.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Something where I felt
like there they are.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's weird, because
your brother, what's

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.190 align:middle line:84%
confusing me is your brother's
talking about a situation

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.190 align:middle line:90%
with your house.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> But then he's talking about
a situation with his house.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:45.150 align:middle line:90%
That's in Arizona.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's like
two separate houses.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:57.750 align:middle line:10%
I just feel when I'm connecting
with him that he tells me

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.170 align:middle line:10%
that even though you can't see
it right now, because I feel

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:10%
like it's very much
like, OK, I don't know,

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.550 align:middle line:10%
is this ever going to work out?

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:10.580 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me, keep the
faith, keep the faith.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.420 align:middle line:10%
Stay positive.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.440 align:middle line:10%
I feel like he's letting me
know that you're going to get

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.320 align:middle line:10%
some resolution with this soon.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.620 align:middle line:10%
It may seem right now like it's
kind of like an endless circle,

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.670 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's really happening.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.110 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like
there is something.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
There's kind of a shift
that's going to be happening.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
they are telling me

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're putting all
your energy towards this.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.690 align:middle line:90%
You're praying about it.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:36.950 align:middle line:90%
You're like, please help me.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Somebody help me.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.420 align:middle line:90%
This is bad.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there was fear
about losing the house.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel like they're
really supporting you there.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this is
what they're showing

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:52.860 align:middle line:84%
me is the big thing, the big
issue you've got to deal with.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.470 align:middle line:90%
But I see that this is OK.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I feel like right now, you're
very close to the situation,

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.550 align:middle line:84%
so it feels like you're like,
how is this going to fix?

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:04.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's like when I
tune into it intuitively,

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not worried about it.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.370 align:middle line:90%
I feel like it's OK.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So this has been a big
issue in your life.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.940 align:middle line:84%
I just closed a
refi last Friday.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm completely
debt free in that way.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:18.160 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So this did just
kind of come yeah.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes you have to
take care of yourself when

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.917 align:middle line:90%
others won't help you.

00:41:23.917 --> 00:41:24.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:24.717 --> 00:41:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Because I want to say--

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And with my God.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to say they're
definitely making me feel

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:33.050 align:middle line:90%
like you've knocked on doors.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.110 align:middle line:90%
You've asked people.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:34.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:35.375 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like so--

00:41:35.375 --> 00:41:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody ran.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --this is going to--

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.650 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be a
new chapter for you.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to say
also, I just heard this.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.728 align:middle line:90%
Who's doing psychology?

00:41:46.728 --> 00:41:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Is one of your kids
doing psychology?

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:49.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, our oldest daughter.

00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Hannah.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Because somebody just,
your son's talking about--

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.420 align:middle line:84%
sorry-- your husband is
talking about-- this is funny.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.466 align:middle line:90%
I want to call him your son.

00:41:57.466 --> 00:41:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>> He was.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So your husband,
probably a past life, right?

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so your husband
is just telling me

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.210 align:middle line:84%
how he feels like you're doing
a really good job with them.

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.980 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking
about the psychology.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he's very
connected to this situation.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's good.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to bring
through, so I know

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:90%
I've got another husband here.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've
got another brother

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:90%
that I need to deal with.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, by the
way, very much.

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:25.720 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Everybody clap for her.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to just move
on to this other person.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.580 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
though, because I

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
don't feel I'm going to
the husband or the brother

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.360 align:middle line:90%
just yet.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I feel I know I've
got them here.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.950 align:middle line:84%
But I want to just see
where I'm going here.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.810 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know where this goes.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:90%


00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a lady coming through
that did pass from cancer.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm connecting
with here, I

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.910 align:middle line:84%
feel she didn't
have a full life.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.870 align:middle line:84%
I want somebody that would
be more in their 30s,

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:90%
or I could take their 40s.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But I'm feeling this
woman coming through.

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm very certain that
this would be your sister.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:21.340 align:middle line:90%
This feels like a sister.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm connecting
with her, she's

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.165 align:middle line:84%
giving me the feeling that
you were very close to her.

00:43:42.165 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.700 align:middle line:90%
But I don't know.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.075 align:middle line:84%
I felt like there
could have been

00:43:48.075 --> 00:43:49.340 align:middle line:90%
maybe some issues at the end.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Her name is Kimmy or Kim.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You have this?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.600 align:middle line:90%
Sister?

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Sister.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, perfect.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:03.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And you have a sister too, Kim?

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> My cousin.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:07.760 align:middle line:90%
It was my sister-cousin.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.620 align:middle line:90%
But did she have cancer?

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, we probably
are with you.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Can we get the
mic to this woman?

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you have it.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:22.670 align:middle line:90%
So Kim is your sister?

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.810 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And you understood the cancer?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.410 align:middle line:90%
This area?

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:30.890 align:middle line:90%
Lung.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm feeling
definitely in this area.

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's see if we can link
in, if we can get anything

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.463 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to see
kind of why she's here.

00:44:38.463 --> 00:44:39.380 align:middle line:90%
So hold on one second.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:52.760 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm also wanting like an almost
like a Cheryl or a Sharon

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.060 align:middle line:90%
or Shirley.

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Shirley.

00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my mother.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:02.580 align:middle line:90%
She's stepping here too.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:04.400 align:middle line:90%
I have both of them.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.710 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:84%
Did mom die a long
time after your sister?

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, a few years.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Few years.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.508 align:middle line:84%
She died after your
sister, though.

00:45:15.508 --> 00:45:19.690 align:middle line:90%


00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
this too, because I

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:27.030 align:middle line:84%
am hearing about this,
that and dad's also passed?

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I have three different
people here coming in.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.844 align:middle line:84%
So I just kind of want to
see what's going on here.

00:45:32.844 --> 00:45:37.670 align:middle line:90%


00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is with
your sister or with you,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.740 align:middle line:84%
but do you live in
your sister's house

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.480 align:middle line:84%
or do you live in
your parents' house?

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I live in my parents' home.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is the home
you were raised in?

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:55.480 align:middle line:90%


00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.280 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you,
by the way, I'm

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.610 align:middle line:84%
supposed to reference
another passing with cancer.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like I've
got your sister.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But was there another
cancer passing?

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Could that be mom?

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:07.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:07.315 --> 00:46:07.570 align:middle line:90%
That's mom.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's mom.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.410 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.282 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also hearing
the name Fay.

00:46:11.282 --> 00:46:12.490 align:middle line:90%
>> My mom's middle name, yes.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:46:13.290 --> 00:46:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So I got this whole
group of people here.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:16.180 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you must have taken care
of mom prior to her past.

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what she's
letting me know.

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I did, six years.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> You took care of her.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:31.630 align:middle line:84%
She's basically making me feel
like you kind of put your life

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:32.990 align:middle line:90%
on hold to deal with her.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a lot of
appreciation from her I feel.

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:40.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you as
I'm connecting here,

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I feel this really
strongly that I

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.600 align:middle line:84%
did feel there's, as
I'm doing the reading,

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
it's really more your sister
and mom at the moment that

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:03.910 align:middle line:90%
have stepped forward.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.530 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your dad will
come back through.

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But I really want
to say I'm more

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:90%
with your sister and your mom.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:13.190 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hearing is, OK,
this is what's coming through.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I feel your mom wants
to apologize to you.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm trying to get
the message correctly,

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:28.470 align:middle line:84%
but she what she's telling me
is that she wants to communicate

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.760 align:middle line:90%
that she did her best.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's things that
she looks back on now that she

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:36.600 align:middle line:84%
feels she really didn't
handle correctly.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.290 align:middle line:84%
But at the moment, she's
telling me with the way

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:45.360 align:middle line:84%
that things were, the way she
was raised, the situation,

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:84%
she didn't know a better
way to handle things.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:55.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But I do feel that she
wants to just say to you,

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I really want you to
know that I loved you.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I really did try my best,
even though there's things

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that in the spirit world
I understand and I would

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.900 align:middle line:90%
have handled them differently.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:07.642 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:07.642 --> 00:48:08.790 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know with her,
when I connect with her,

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.270 align:middle line:84%
it's interesting, because I do
feel this closeness with her.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I do feel that you had a
close connection with her.

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.808 align:middle line:84%
But I also feel like there
was this other aspect

00:48:20.808 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of the other
relationship where there

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.590 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of tension
and unspoken things

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:26.490 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.120 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk about with
your mom that she is telling me

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:40.350 align:middle line:84%
that you were put in a certain
situation where it was almost

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.300 align:middle line:84%
like you couldn't
talk about things.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't express yourself
in the way you wanted.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:45.410 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And she just wants to
validate that I feel like that,

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.600 align:middle line:84%
it's again, I don't feel like
she really knew sort of like

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.330 align:middle line:90%
another way is what I'm feeling.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.290 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.480 align:middle line:84%
I have another thing I
need to bring through.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Do you know Bill or no?

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill, that would be an uncle.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, an uncle.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's a whole group
of uncles here getting drunk.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:08.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:09.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what they would do.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.560 align:middle line:90%
They would drink.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm like yeah, OK.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.812 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:13.812 --> 00:49:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
almost like they're

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:84%
drinking each other
under the table

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.000 align:middle line:90%
is the memory I'm getting.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Like it's almost like
we're all going to get it.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So I did feel that.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
this too that I

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.350 align:middle line:84%
feel when I connect
with your father a bit

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that he's showing me a sense
of he stepped into something

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.010 align:middle line:90%
towards alcoholism--

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:42.100 align:middle line:90%
He was an alcoholic.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.040 align:middle line:90%
>> --at one point.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:43.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to say I felt there
was a part of your childhood

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.190 align:middle line:90%
where maybe he wasn't as much.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> But I definitely felt it got
worse and worse and amplified

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.660 align:middle line:90%
and stuff.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And I need to talk
about also, like I said,

00:49:55.390 --> 00:50:00.890 align:middle line:84%
with your mom, this is
what they're telling me.

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know how the
spirit world works.

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, they
will communicate.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.290 align:middle line:84%
They may intentionally
communicate

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.610 align:middle line:84%
things a little bit vague
or a little bit more open.

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hearing about
is there's very big changes

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.510 align:middle line:84%
coming up around you in
the next couple years.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And you need to not be scared,
because they're telling me

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.145 align:middle line:90%
that you're a little nervous.

00:50:21.145 --> 00:50:22.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But they are telling
me, don't worry.

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.390 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be fine.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.598 align:middle line:90%
You're being divinely guided.

00:50:26.598 --> 00:50:27.398 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:50:27.398 --> 00:50:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It may be important for you
to maybe spend some time away

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:90%
from California.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that's important
to tell you though.

00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Do you live here?

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:44.475 align:middle line:90%
But I'm planning to move.

00:50:44.475 --> 00:50:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're
thinking of moving.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:46.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.025 align:middle line:84%
Because I was
almost going to say

00:50:48.025 --> 00:50:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel like you may always
have a certain connection here.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But I'm getting the feeling
of maybe being out of here

00:50:56.610 --> 00:51:00.030 align:middle line:84%
would be good for you,
just a new energy.

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm being told
from the spirit world

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is they're bringing in
people into your life that

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.590 align:middle line:84%
can help you with that, who
can support you with that.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So just know that that's
happening for you.

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:14.445 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're just telling
me, it could be a year.

00:51:14.445 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:90%
It could be six months.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.640 align:middle line:90%
It could be.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.548 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the timing
is that important.

00:51:18.548 --> 00:51:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's just
important to tell you

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:24.420 align:middle line:90%
that there's some time.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like you leave
out of here type thing.

00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:27.630 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So am I right in saying
you're already gearing up?

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You're 100%.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:35.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's just I feel like
what they're talking about.

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
another thing too.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:90%
I feel very strongly about--

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.745 align:middle line:90%
hold on one second.

00:51:43.745 --> 00:51:46.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:46.740 --> 00:51:49.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm seeing
like big band or something.

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> My parents were big band.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:52.350 align:middle line:90%
My mom was a big band singer.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:52.500 align:middle line:90%
My dad was--

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:53.070 --> 00:51:53.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm like I feel like I'm
seeing like old music

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.000 align:middle line:90%
scenes or something.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I want to say so
you actually had a lot

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.620 align:middle line:84%
of connection with your
mom and you through music.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.095 align:middle line:90%
We're both singers.

00:52:07.095 --> 00:52:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, and you would do
that together sometimes.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I just want
to say, yeah, I just

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:18.194 align:middle line:84%
have to tell you that when
I connect with your mom--

00:52:18.194 --> 00:52:21.526 align:middle line:90%
hold on one second.

00:52:21.526 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:34.800 align:middle line:84%
She's making me feel just she's
very connected to your energy.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:37.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
another thing too.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you get the butterflies
from your sister?

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I'm
seeing butterflies.

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And your sister's making me
feel this is a sign that she

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.730 align:middle line:84%
uses just to let you
know she's around.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:46.910 align:middle line:84%
I always know it's
her when I see them.

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:47.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:48.020 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely that.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like
that's the validation.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:49.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.750 align:middle line:90%
Good, good, good.

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:90%
All right, well, thank you.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:52.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you so much.

00:52:52.785 --> 00:52:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That was nice.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:90%
So we'll just keep going here.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.740 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to let
you guys know also,

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.440 align:middle line:84%
and I put it on
some of your chairs.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.330 align:middle line:90%
We're doing great on time.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to tell
you, I did put a notice

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.750 align:middle line:90%
on a couple of your guys' chair.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I do have a show next week
that I'm putting together.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to invite
you guys all there.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.640 align:middle line:90%
There's still some tickets left.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It is sort of a one man show
about my life as a psychic.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I put a lot of
hard work into it.

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:24.920 align:middle line:90%
I think you'll learn a lot.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.870 align:middle line:90%
I am doing readings at it too.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So a big part of it is
I actually do readings.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So you could have
a reading there.

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:34.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's also about
my life and what

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.640 align:middle line:84%
it is to have this ability
and things like that.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.950 align:middle line:84%
So I did put that, again,
it starts next Thursday.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So OK now, I want
to do the brother,

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.500 align:middle line:90%
if we can link in with that.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And I want to do
the other partner

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.620 align:middle line:84%
that there was another
partner that I'm getting.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to do also there's
even there's other people here.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.650 align:middle line:90%
So let's kind of keep going.

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So I know the brother
and the husband

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.120 align:middle line:84%
are going to be the right
connection in a second.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Hold on a second.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lady coming
through that I'm picking up on.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to go indirect with
this, because I'm not sure.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really like
feeling a certain draw

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:16.510 align:middle line:90%
in any part of the room.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to kind
of bring her through.

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So this woman's
coming through, and I

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:28.460 align:middle line:84%
want to say with
her, first off, she's

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.710 align:middle line:84%
giving me the impression
that when she passes,

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:32.130 align:middle line:90%
she's an elderly woman.

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:32.930 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:36.830 align:middle line:84%
So I want somebody who
is I feel in their 80s.

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:38.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.760 align:middle line:90%
I feel in their 80s.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.590 align:middle line:84%
This woman is coming
through to me.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:44.480 align:middle line:90%
She feels like a mother figure.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to say some of
these relationships

00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:49.820 align:middle line:84%
I was like it was very
specific who they were.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.920 align:middle line:84%
This is more like I
can tell she's an older

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:53.600 align:middle line:90%
woman that you were close with.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.510 align:middle line:84%
I could take a mother
or a mother-in-law.

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.160 align:middle line:90%
I could take a step mother.

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I feel when I connect with her
that she had a lot of health

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:06.550 align:middle line:90%
problems prior to her passing.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:07.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:13.090 align:middle line:84%
She's showing me terrible
problems with breathing.

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:15.070 align:middle line:84%
She's giving me
breathing issues.

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.790 align:middle line:10%
She's actually, yeah, she keeps
showing me breathing issues.

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:25.510 align:middle line:84%
She's also showing with
me when I connect with her

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:30.450 align:middle line:90%
that there was a big decision.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel like she's come through
to talk about the family

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.190 align:middle line:90%
dispute.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big family dispute
with her after she passes,

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:42.600 align:middle line:84%
not really connected
to her, but I

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.940 align:middle line:84%
feel like with other
people that are

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.350 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
I feel like this

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.390 align:middle line:90%
could be amongst your siblings.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.040 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like
there's a big family

00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:54.460 align:middle line:84%
dispute, which I sense is still
going on to a certain degree.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So it does feel like there
are still people not talking,

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm also knowing with this woman
that she's very, very, very

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:05.010 align:middle line:84%
connected when she's
healthier, when she's younger.

00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But she's showing me
gardening, and specifically I'm

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:90%
seeing rose gardens.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I could be
getting other stuff too.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.713 align:middle line:90%
What did you say?

00:56:14.713 --> 00:56:17.338 align:middle line:84%
>> So, I mean, what
you're saying just-- well,

00:56:17.338 --> 00:56:18.490 align:middle line:90%
it sounds like my mom.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:19.427 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:56:19.427 --> 00:56:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Do you have Richard?

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:23.500 align:middle line:90%
So I'm with you, dear.

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's fine.

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, all right.

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:28.480 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So your husband that passed?

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:35.410 align:middle line:90%
I have both the people them.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Within 11 days of each other.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, within 11
days of each other.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Oh, dear.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So but all that stuff that I was
saying about your mom connected

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:45.850 align:middle line:90%
with her?

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:46.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So then and then Richard is
your husband then also passed?

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.235 align:middle line:90%
Now I also have Rosalyn.

00:56:54.235 --> 00:56:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you have?

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.435 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Richard's mom.

00:56:58.435 --> 00:56:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's who, honey?

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:00.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Richard's mom.

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Richard's mom.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, your mother-in-law.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:03.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:03.820 align:middle line:90%
>> My mother-in-law.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So this is a different
person that's come through.

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:08.420 align:middle line:90%
But there's three people here.

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.620 align:middle line:90%
There's your mother-in-law.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.030 align:middle line:90%


00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:14.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to just tell you.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Can I just, and
it's like, I don't

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:17.590 align:middle line:84%
want to get too, because
I feel like, well, this

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:18.798 align:middle line:90%
is a lot of people just here.

00:57:18.798 --> 00:57:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But I actually just
have to make sure

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I get all the people through.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:27.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's another person
that wants to be acknowledged.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:32.277 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I am hearing
David, David, David.

00:57:32.277 --> 00:57:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Ros' husband was David.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Is he?

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:35.520 align:middle line:90%
>> My father-in-law.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Your father-in-law.

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:38.282 align:middle line:84%
So it's just, yeah,
it's interesting.

00:57:38.282 --> 00:57:40.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole big group
of people here, I guess.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
that it was interesting

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.720 align:middle line:84%
because mom was the first
one that came through.

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to just tell
you that, and this

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.530 align:middle line:84%
is kind of a message for
everybody, but a lot of times

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I hear from people
in the spirit world

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:59.190 align:middle line:84%
that when two souls
cross over together,

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.090 align:middle line:90%
there is a significance in that.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:02.950 align:middle line:90%
There is a meaning in that.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And it usually does mean
that the souls are together.

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.170 align:middle line:90%
The souls are connected.

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So just know that
even though they're

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.920 align:middle line:84%
different sides of the family,
your husband and your mom,

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I do feel they
are together over there.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:21.213 align:middle line:90%
They're coming through together.

00:58:21.213 --> 00:58:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And then this whole
group is here with them

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.510 align:middle line:90%
kind of as a supportive energy.

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But I got a feeling that it's
kind of this whole thing here.

00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you when I'm
connecting with you also

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:39.260 align:middle line:84%
that Richard is
communicating to me that he

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.670 align:middle line:90%
thought he had more time.

00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:43.370 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know if
this is something

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:45.650 align:middle line:10%
where it was kind of abrupt.

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I almost felt like
maybe he was sick,

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:50.900 align:middle line:84%
but it all happened
abruptly or something.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.400 align:middle line:90%
That's the feeling I'm getting.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.990 align:middle line:84%
But he's definitely
letting me know

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:57.380 align:middle line:84%
that he would have thought that
he had a little bit more time.

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's making me feel
like everything wrapped up

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:90%
at the end very quickly.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.783 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
this because it's

00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:04.160 align:middle line:90%
coming through really strongly.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you just have a year
anniversary with somebody?

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> With Richard.

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because I'm supposed
to talk about like the one year.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want to tell you also
this is coming through really

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:23.390 align:middle line:84%
strongly that your
mom is talking about

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that she's very
appreciative with you

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that even as she
was getting older

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.110 align:middle line:84%
and she couldn't do as
much and things like that,

00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:32.660 align:middle line:84%
she keeps telling me that
you never forgot her.

00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd always go and visit her
and check on her and hold her

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:37.830 align:middle line:90%
hand and be with her.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:40.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And she's very, very
thankful about that.

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:84%
She's literally telling
me like, thank you

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.470 align:middle line:90%
for staying connected with me.

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I do feel I get a
tremendous sense of peace when

00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.230 align:middle line:90%
she goes to the spirit world.

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But I feel that there's
just this feeling

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.150 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of you being
there and you being around

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:06.730 align:middle line:84%
her is really I feel was
very meaningful for her.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I also want to tell
you this too as I'm

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
connecting that I feel that this
is more coming from Richard.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But Richard is telling me
that since his passing,

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and I know he was
talking about the year,

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:28.290 align:middle line:84%
but he's just kind of
reminding me about this.

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But he wants to tell me that
you will feel him around you.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.480 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.920 align:middle line:90%
You will feel him around you.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I feel with him he's
a very strong spirit.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And he's giving me the feeling
that he's right there kind

01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:43.710 align:middle line:90%
of by your side.

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
He's also telling
me, and I always

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:49.050 align:middle line:84%
tell people with messages,
some things are so specific,

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:50.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's like you know.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes,
it's like they

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.502 align:middle line:84%
want to talk about things
that they want to talk about.

01:00:53.502 --> 01:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
So he just is
communicating to me

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
that he loved being
married to you.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
He really misses the
relationship that you guys had.

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And even though somebody has
gone to the spirit world,

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.590 align:middle line:84%
they can still miss that
physical connection,

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:08.640 align:middle line:90%
that physical touch.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they talk about that.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like somebody
goes to the spirit world,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're just
kind of over there,

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and they don't care about
what we're doing here.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they do.

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:19.043 align:middle line:84%
So they can miss
those things that they

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:19.960 align:middle line:90%
don't have over there.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.585 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
tell you that's what

01:01:21.585 --> 01:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I am hearing from him that he
misses that physical connection

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:28.050 align:middle line:90%
of touching you, holding you.

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
But like I said,
I get his energy.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
He's right there with you.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I even feel like
he's talking about being

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.545 align:middle line:90%
present in your house.

01:01:37.545 --> 01:01:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
He's very, yeah, the house,
he's very present there.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
So just and my
sense is that he's

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
doing that more to just comfort
you, to kind of let you know,

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.910 align:middle line:90%
hey, I'm OK.

01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:52.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a good place.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to still be
there for you and stuff.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.230 align:middle line:90%
So I do feel like he is.

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.600 align:middle line:84%
He is, it feels like, very,
very connected to you.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So that was
interesting, because I

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
felt I knew there was a husband
that wanted to come through.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that all
matched up for you.

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And we just we still
have this brother

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.730 align:middle line:90%
here that didn't come through.

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So the brother, I still
feel like I'm back there.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So that lady said she
has a brother maybe.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:24.870 align:middle line:90%


01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.460 align:middle line:84%
By the way, where's
the notebook?

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:33.400 align:middle line:90%


01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Can we pass the
notebook this way?

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:38.210 align:middle line:90%


01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So just to kind of
explain to you guys,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.200 align:middle line:90%
there's a notebook there.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's got just put your
email address into it.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
to send you a meditation
that's in my voice.

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.987 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually use it
to connect with your own loved

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:54.787 align:middle line:90%
ones.

01:02:54.787 --> 01:02:56.180 align:middle line:90%
It's about 15 minutes.

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
People seem to really have
good experiences with it.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm also going to pick one
person who writes their email

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
address down to get a session
with me, so a free session.

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So I'll just email
whoever that is.

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So OK, so just make sure that
keeps going around to people.

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't signed up,
make sure you sign up.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And then remember, 1:30, I'm
going to do my book signing.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:21.612 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's keep going
here with the brother.

01:03:21.612 --> 01:03:24.738 align:middle line:84%
So the brother, but let me just
see if I'm ready to go there.

01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:25.538 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

01:03:25.538 --> 01:03:31.700 align:middle line:90%


01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I just got to see if I
can get this real quick.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
There's another
person that wants to.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
over here maybe,

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
but I'm hearing the name Paul.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm hearing
the name Paul.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Paul.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't know specifically.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.700 align:middle line:84%
This has nothing to
do with the brother.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.500 align:middle line:84%
But I've got a Paul
coming through.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And I feel when I'm connecting
with this person also

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
it feels like somebody's
dad, maybe a father.

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:06.725 align:middle line:90%
OK, could you take this?

01:04:06.725 --> 01:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And then this lady
is raising her hand.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:09.640 align:middle line:90%
But this is Paul passed.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.290 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.290 --> 01:04:14.480 align:middle line:90%
You have a living father Paul?

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.180 align:middle line:90%


01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's not Paul.

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:19.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And you have Paul
who's your dad?

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

01:04:23.824 --> 01:04:24.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:29.570 align:middle line:90%


01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess you'll
either have this

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.930 align:middle line:84%
or you won't and then
we'll know if it's you.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.480 align:middle line:10%
Do you have a sister
that you found out about?

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:40.400 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.250 align:middle line:10%
So this is for you then.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:48.340 align:middle line:10%
Is that connected to Paul or is
that connected to your mother?

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I have three sisters that I
found out about because I did

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.280 align:middle line:90%
it 23andMe test.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So because your father's
bringing this up.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
So are these his children?

01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's connected
to your mom.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul is the man that
adopted me, but raised me.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So you found out about family
from your biological family?

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:09.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Last year.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:05:10.350 --> 01:05:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But Paul is your adoptive
dad, but he's like your dad.

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> He's my dad.

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he's your dad.

01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's interesting.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I feel that he is
bringing that up.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And my sense that
he's bringing that up

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is that people have
an interesting way

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
come through, how

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
they want to talk about things.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:32.520 align:middle line:10%
I know when I connect
with you energetically

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that your father, he very
much divinely guides you.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.950 align:middle line:90%
I feel like he's with you a lot.

01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
So my sense is he may
have actually helped

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
that all to happen
and orchestrate that,

01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:47.640 align:middle line:84%
or he may have kind
of brought, you know,

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I just have to say
I do feel that.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.690 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:55.870 align:middle line:90%


01:05:55.870 --> 01:05:59.200 align:middle line:84%
I just feel very, very close
connection with him and you.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's
almost like some of it

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
almost feels in a way almost
like a spiritual connection

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.720 align:middle line:90%
almost.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.530 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels like beyond
words, so to speak.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.120 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Did he leave a
family business?

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:17.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought so, yeah, because
I felt like he's talking about

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:22.980 align:middle line:90%
a business that he left down.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Now I just got a really
strong thing about this,

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know if this is with
him or with something else I'm

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
picking up on, but I got
a strong image of somebody

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.970 align:middle line:90%
in a wheelchair.

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That was my dad.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:38.793 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he was in a wheelchair
at the end of his life.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> But he's making me feel like
he didn't really want to be

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.810 align:middle line:90%
limited by the wheelchair.

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> He wasn't.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:48.132 align:middle line:84%
>> And he'd go
places and do things.

01:06:48.132 --> 01:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost like, well,
this is what I'm going to do.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Taking trips?

01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have any memories
of going to Florida with him

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:56.850 align:middle line:90%
in the wheelchair?

01:06:56.850 --> 01:06:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, because I feel like
he's showing me Florida.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:05.040 align:middle line:90%


01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I do get a sense with
your father of kind of I

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
definitely feel a sense
of humor with him,

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.012 align:middle line:84%
kind of like a dry sense of
humor, but I do feel that.

01:07:14.012 --> 01:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand that?

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:19.580 align:middle line:84%
He's almost making me feel
like kind of sarcastic.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Very sarcastic.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.700 align:middle line:90%
That's how he's coming through.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you also,
he's communicating to me

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that he is very aware
of your spiritual life.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And he's telling me that he
takes a great interest in it.

01:07:34.410 --> 01:07:37.350 align:middle line:10%
He's making me feel like a
lot of your time and energy

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:39.390 align:middle line:10%
and things you do
in the world is

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.580 align:middle line:10%
connected to raising
your vibration

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.855 align:middle line:10%
and your spirituality.

01:07:42.855 --> 01:07:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like it's a
big part of your life.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And dad is telling
me that he sees that,

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and I do want to say that.

01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:51.651 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:52.553 align:middle line:90%
I have another thing.

01:07:52.553 --> 01:07:55.260 align:middle line:90%


01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Who's the J female that keeps
coming through, mother figure?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.400 align:middle line:90%
>> June.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that mom?

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:01.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:08.600 align:middle line:84%
So and am I right in saying
that your father passed first?

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.570 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's funny, because
your dad is saying,

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of enjoying
my time relaxing

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.024 align:middle line:90%
until your mom got here.

01:08:22.024 --> 01:08:23.509 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd believe it.

01:08:23.509 --> 01:08:26.479 align:middle line:90%


01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.399 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Because I want to tell
you this feels to me

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:42.110 align:middle line:10%
that this person, this lady,
she's not an easy person.

01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all.

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And your father's making
me feel like all of this

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.300 align:middle line:84%
is stuff that he had to
kind of deal with that too.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
He had to deal with
that side of her.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.080 align:middle line:10%
I feel your
relationships are it's

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.760 align:middle line:10%
like they're totally different.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.437 align:middle line:84%
You're much closer to
your father I feel.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:02.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:02.057 --> 01:09:04.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel like your mom, I
almost get the sense with her

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.019 align:middle line:90%
like she always had to be right.

01:09:06.019 --> 01:09:06.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:06.819 --> 01:09:07.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Very stubborn.

01:09:07.866 --> 01:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>> She was a
principal of a school.

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.600 align:middle line:90%
She knew it all.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And I just kind of feel that.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.108 align:middle line:84%
Like it's almost like
she's got to be right.

01:09:15.108 --> 01:09:16.150 align:middle line:90%
She's got to be stubborn.

01:09:16.150 --> 01:09:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.439 align:middle line:10%
>> And she keeps
telling me also,

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:22.060 align:middle line:10%
especially at the
end of her life,

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.170 align:middle line:10%
that you were trying to
make things easy for her.

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:28.408 align:middle line:84%
>> And she was like
going against you almost.

01:09:28.408 --> 01:09:29.450 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm saying?

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>> She never listened.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you say, honey?

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:32.069 align:middle line:90%
>> She never listened.

01:09:32.069 --> 01:09:32.660 align:middle line:90%
>> She didn't listen.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.163 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was feeling.

01:09:34.163 --> 01:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to kind of do
her own thing and stuff.

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I just want to bring
this through to you

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.510 align:middle line:90%
that she sees that now.

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:46.279 align:middle line:90%
I want to say she does see that.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And she sees how
she was difficult.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.660 align:middle line:10%
She sees how there
was negativity.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.000 align:middle line:84%
She sees how she
contributed to that.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.700 align:middle line:84%
And basically, she wants
me to tell you that.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I want to just tell
you your dad is telling me,

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
this means to you,

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
but your father's telling me
that he's helping your son.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand that.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
He just told me to tell
you that, that you'd

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:10.400 align:middle line:90%
understand what he's saying.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So he said, to tell my
daughter I'm helping her son,

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and everything's fine.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm helping her.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm helping her
through by helping him.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.495 align:middle line:90%
And your mom, I don't know.

01:10:22.495 --> 01:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
She's not really
helping anybody.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:25.860 align:middle line:90%
She's just kind of hanging out.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel like
she's expressing to me,

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.683 align:middle line:84%
though, like I said,
just that, and people

01:10:38.683 --> 01:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
talk about this a lot when
they go to the other side

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.720 align:middle line:90%
that they have a life review.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.520 align:middle line:90%
And they review.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.170 align:middle line:10%
We all will have
that at some point

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:48.750 align:middle line:10%
where we actually have
to review birth to death.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And we have to see some
of the things that we did.

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like in
this woman's thing,

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:57.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel a lot of
fear in her energy.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.912 align:middle line:84%
I feel a lot of, again,
and that's not to say,

01:10:59.912 --> 01:11:01.370 align:middle line:84%
because I don't
feel this, it's not

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
to say she's in a bad place,
or she's in a dark place,

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
or there's anything like that.

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.110 align:middle line:10%
But of course, when you
go to the other side,

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:11.210 align:middle line:10%
you do have to deal with
those different things

01:11:11.210 --> 01:11:12.590 align:middle line:10%
in your vibration.

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:15.743 align:middle line:10%
So the better thing
is when you're here,

01:11:15.743 --> 01:11:17.910 align:middle line:10%
because ultimately, you
have to deal with it anyway,

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.030 align:middle line:10%
so it's better if,
what I've been told

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:22.280 align:middle line:10%
is deal with these things here.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Try to be the best
person that you can here.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:26.000 align:middle line:90%
Try to be authentic.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Try to be honest.

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Try to be forthcoming.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.690 align:middle line:10%
Try to be kindness,
compassion others.

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because that way, when
you go to the other side,

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.400 align:middle line:84%
you get to experience those
things rather than the friction

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.880 align:middle line:84%
that this woman created
and sort of the negativity.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it helps
her soul to learn.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.080 align:middle line:10%
Because I feel that
she was this stuff,

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.650 align:middle line:10%
but she didn't really
kind of get it.

01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:49.920 align:middle line:10%
Do you know Russell?

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:53.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why that.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It was mom's
boyfriend after dad died.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:11:56.690 --> 01:12:03.130 align:middle line:90%


01:12:03.130 --> 01:12:04.435 align:middle line:90%
Was he a negative?

01:12:04.435 --> 01:12:06.007 align:middle line:90%
>> He was a pig.

01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:06.807 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:12:06.807 --> 01:12:09.430 align:middle line:90%


01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:12.935 align:middle line:84%
Can I just ask you something
that's coming through to me?

01:12:12.935 --> 01:12:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just trying
to understand this.

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But your dad is just
telling me this.

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:20.922 align:middle line:84%
So you could take the
message about your son.

01:12:20.922 --> 01:12:21.880 align:middle line:90%
That made sense to you.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:25.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's two other
things that I want to say.

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:35.290 align:middle line:90%


01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Would I see military
stuff with your daddy?

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
My biological father,
yes, was a police officer.

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:48.070 align:middle line:84%
So that's connected
to this other family.

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, my bio family.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:54.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do I feel like there's
one sister you've gotten closer

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.665 align:middle line:90%
to of the ones that you found?

01:12:55.665 --> 01:12:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you would
be correct with that.

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:12:59.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:00.883 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel like
they're showing me this.

01:13:00.883 --> 01:13:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Like I almost feel like
I went into this guy now.

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I'm three
months older than her.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So dad was doing my
mom and doing her mom.

01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

01:13:13.405 --> 01:13:14.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, that was nice of him.

01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:15.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
So see, why do you
need TV, right?

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.710 align:middle line:90%
That's good though.

01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, I just feel
like when what I'm

01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
connecting with
the energy of it,

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
this is really
good actually, when

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm connecting with
the energy with it,

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:43.050 align:middle line:84%
it feels very it's almost
like I want to say I feel just

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:45.270 align:middle line:84%
by you reaching out and
finding these people,

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.088 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't become
best, best friends,

01:13:48.088 --> 01:13:50.505 align:middle line:84%
it's like there's a healing
that's happened to the family.

01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, yes.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they're really
honoring you for that

01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
because they're saying like,
it's just this trickle down

01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:00.154 align:middle line:84%
effect of a tremendous
amount of healing.

01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:01.950 align:middle line:90%
So OK?

01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So thank you very much.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.480 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for OK.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So I wanted to see if
we can with the brother,

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.270 align:middle line:84%
because that feels like
it keeps coming through.

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:14.617 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll see if
I can get through one,

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:16.450 align:middle line:84%
a couple of other people
if there's another.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's just see what
else we feel here.

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:21.642 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

01:14:21.642 --> 01:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%


01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Where is that woman?

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:37.006 align:middle line:84%
Where are you that I
was just talking to?

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, OK.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Because for some reason,
they're using you as a place,

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
so I feel like I'm
still in this area.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:46.148 align:middle line:90%


01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Hmm, this is sort
of a little weird.

01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm going to
get a lot with this person.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
This man is coming through,
and he feels very confused

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:54.940 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:59.320 align:middle line:90%


01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.360 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't really know what.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
I think this is like, yeah.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:08.580 align:middle line:90%


01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.350 align:middle line:84%
He's giving me the
feeling, I want

01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to just be honest, because
they don't communicate

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
in words or sentences,
even though I'll

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.290 align:middle line:90%
get thoughts and things.

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So I can communicate with
people from other languages.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if maybe I'm
connecting with this person,

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's like they maybe I don't
know if they speak English.

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:29.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.780 align:middle line:10%
I do want to say
I feel like I want

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.330 align:middle line:10%
to talk about a foreign
country for some reason.

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:35.400 align:middle line:10%
That's just what I'm hearing.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.730 align:middle line:10%
And I know that I've
got a father's brother.

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:43.670 align:middle line:10%
I know that I have
somebody's father's brother.

01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:48.020 align:middle line:10%
So it would be your
uncle coming through.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I want this person
to have passed,

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
they definitely passed within
the last four or five years,

01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:57.090 align:middle line:90%
I want to say.

01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing is
this person, they were sick.

01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:07.840 align:middle line:84%
But it almost feels like,
at the end, it was like,

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.720 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, this
person's like, I feel

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.075 align:middle line:84%
like it could have been
one of those things

01:16:12.075 --> 01:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
where you thought you had--

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.480 align:middle line:84%
I definitely want to talk
about the foreign country,

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
because I want to talk about
a geographical separation.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to talk
about my brother in Atlanta

01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:23.670 align:middle line:90%
for some reason.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.330 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea why.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.310 align:middle line:84%
So I've got all these
things coming through.

01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say
father's brother, passed.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
my brother in Atlanta.

01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:35.600 align:middle line:90%
That's my other brother.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about a
past in a foreign country.

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So let me just see here.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting the impression that
you were close to this man,

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
like you loved him.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.383 align:middle line:84%
I don't really feel
like he's somebody

01:16:51.383 --> 01:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
that you saw all the
time, but you would

01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:55.770 align:middle line:90%
have had a connection with him.

01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
I feel there was love between
him and stuff and you.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.490 align:middle line:90%


01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.490 align:middle line:90%
You have this?

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got the
exact situation.

01:17:04.490 --> 01:17:05.740 align:middle line:90%
But actually, it is my father.

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't have uncle.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:08.790 align:middle line:90%
But it is my father, yeah.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.130 align:middle line:90%
>> You have your father.

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:10.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> And yeah, he was in Ukraine.

01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:15.310 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, you have this.

01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:18.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:19.442 align:middle line:90%
Let's just see here.

01:17:19.442 --> 01:17:20.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And the same things.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.600 align:middle line:90%
We didn't see each other, but--

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have the
thing with Atlanta?

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know then.

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if that
really resonate.

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:30.330 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:37.270 align:middle line:90%


01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:38.782 align:middle line:90%
OK, so maybe, I don't know then.

01:17:38.782 --> 01:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we might have
to leave this person.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels like I
need a little bit more.

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:48.920 align:middle line:90%


01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me just see
if I can get one more

01:17:53.290 --> 01:17:54.930 align:middle line:90%
thing with this person.

01:17:54.930 --> 01:18:00.892 align:middle line:90%


01:18:00.892 --> 01:18:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's just start a
little bit more basic.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.472 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody here have
a father's brother

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:06.680 align:middle line:90%
that died in another country?

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You do?

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
You do?

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.360 align:middle line:90%
In India?

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And mine is there too.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.974 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have the
Atlanta thing or no?

01:18:14.974 --> 01:18:16.575 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:18:16.575 --> 01:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Go to her, though.

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.537 align:middle line:90%
Can you just go to her?

01:18:18.537 --> 01:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%


01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So your father's brother
passed in the last five years?

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:27.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.320 align:middle line:90%
>> And you do understand?

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.950 align:middle line:90%


01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But you don't connect with
Atlanta for any reason?

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Georgia?

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.288 align:middle line:10%
>> We have family friends there.

01:18:38.288 --> 01:18:39.330 align:middle line:10%
>> You have family there?

01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:40.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:42.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Same side of the family?

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.320 align:middle line:10%
Is it your uncle's side?

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.250 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.050 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:47.560 align:middle line:10%
OK, interesting.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.760 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:55.520 align:middle line:10%
And your father's brother
did pass in India?

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:56.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.180 align:middle line:90%


01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand
something about him

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:08.570 align:middle line:84%
saying that your dad was
thinking about going there?

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> But he didn't
end up going there.

01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.720 align:middle line:84%
But something about he put
the phone up or somebody put

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:15.770 align:middle line:90%
the phone up to his ear.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.213 align:middle line:90%
Would that make sense?

01:19:17.213 --> 01:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, he didn't think he
would be able to make it there.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.390 align:middle line:90%
So they were on Skype.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I see.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> He did end up going.

01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> But then he ended up coming?

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So there was there was concern
maybe of not or something?

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:33.498 --> 01:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me just work on this a
little bit more and see if this

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.090 align:middle line:90%
is correct or not.

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Would with your uncle when
he comes through to me

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:44.408 align:middle line:84%
if I'm getting this
right, because I

01:19:44.408 --> 01:19:46.450 align:middle line:84%
feel like I could be with
you, but it's still not

01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:48.790 align:middle line:84%
as strong as I wanted to
be, so let me just ask you

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:49.780 align:middle line:90%
one other thing.

01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:52.090 align:middle line:90%
Does he does know your family?

01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Like he would know your
siblings and things like that?

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:19:57.272 --> 01:19:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Who's the little boy that
he would talk about with

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.533 align:middle line:90%
the letter a is that a nephew?

01:20:01.533 --> 01:20:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a nephew?

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:07.060 align:middle line:90%
So your nephew is an A?

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Both my nephews are A.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Are As.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:10.416 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:10.416 --> 01:20:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So those are like
his great nephews?

01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:14.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:20:14.090 --> 01:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're close
to them I feel.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:15.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Extremely close to them.

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:18.128 align:middle line:84%
>> You're very
close to them, yeah.

01:20:18.128 --> 01:20:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:22.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I tell you, I don't know.

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
give you the letter.

01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:25.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm really trying to get it.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But somebody wants to
show me it's a city,

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and it starts with the letter B.
And I feel like they're talking

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
about this where, I don't
know where your uncle lived

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:39.670 align:middle line:90%
or something.

01:20:39.670 --> 01:20:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Did he live in a B city?

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.990 align:middle line:90%


01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Not at the time
that he passed away.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have family that
would be in a city with a B?

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:53.890 align:middle line:84%
This is weird I'm seeing
B, and it's a city,

01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:56.610 align:middle line:90%
but it's far from here.

01:20:56.610 --> 01:20:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I think it would be over there.

01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> In India?

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:00.330 --> 01:21:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Possibly.

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:01.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.372 align:middle line:90%
>> I just I can't recall.

01:21:02.372 --> 01:21:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I just want to
talk about this.

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, this
is coming through.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But I still feel
like I'm with you.

01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:12.290 align:middle line:10%
Some of this stuff
is kind of not,

01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:14.420 align:middle line:10%
but it feels like there is.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And can I just ask you
also, who's the letter N,

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.560 align:middle line:90%
because I'm seeing this?

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.730 align:middle line:90%
Is this a brother of yours?

01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this is
my younger brother.

01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:21.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Your younger brother.

01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:22.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So your living
younger brother is N.

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And your uncle
would know him too?

01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I just feel
like, first off,

01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I feel like he's sending a
lot of love to these people.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:37.297 align:middle line:10%
Can I ask you, is there a
big family trip coming up?

01:21:37.297 --> 01:21:39.130 align:middle line:10%
>> We just came back
from a big family trip.

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:39.930 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:42.420 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, there's something
with a big family trip.

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Now who's the medical
doctor that your uncle

01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:45.590 align:middle line:90%
would talk about?

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Is that him or his brother?

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's my father and
also my younger brother.

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but your father
is a medical doctor,

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:53.860 align:middle line:90%
this man's brother?

01:21:53.860 --> 01:21:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:58.250 align:middle line:10%
I want to say, and
I don't know, maybe

01:21:58.250 --> 01:22:01.370 align:middle line:10%
it's just like a cultural thing,
but when this guy came through,

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:05.040 align:middle line:10%
I did feel that he was
kind of like, what is this?

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:05.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Probably.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.920 align:middle line:10%
>> But I feel that
it's interesting,

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.170 align:middle line:10%
because I sort of feel like
he's come through to you today,

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:18.080 align:middle line:10%
but more to give a
message to his brother.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's like more
actually for your dad

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.520 align:middle line:90%
than it actually is you.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.270 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:25.070 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:26.990 align:middle line:10%
Hold on one second.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Though I just want to tell
you, they are telling me

01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:34.330 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just hearing
this from the other side,

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:37.750 align:middle line:10%
and I just am hearing
this as a message for you,

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:40.190 align:middle line:10%
did you have your heart
broken this last year?

01:22:40.190 --> 01:22:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
You had something
where you really you

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
felt like, oh, this
is a real positive.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of didn't
work out that way.

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:54.500 align:middle line:84%
Because they're showing me
heartbreak, heart broken,

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.300 align:middle line:90%
heart break.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
What they're showing
me is that this

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.360 align:middle line:90%
has happened a couple of times.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.250 align:middle line:84%
But this last one,
they're just showing me

01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that this it feels like, I'm
trying to be as specific,

01:23:07.230 --> 01:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
but I'm getting the sense that
it was very strange how it all

01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.070 align:middle line:90%
happened.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:12.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you understand?

01:23:12.485 --> 01:23:13.285 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:23:13.285 --> 01:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
It feels really
strange or something.

01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:16.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was very threw
you off, very unexpected.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Almost like I want to say
like I feel you in your mind

01:23:25.530 --> 01:23:27.300 align:middle line:84%
being like, is
this person crazy?

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Like it's more than
just like, oh, we broke up.

01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We weren't-- it's more
like somebody acting out

01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:37.410 align:middle line:90%
of character almost.

01:23:37.410 --> 01:23:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:41.945 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're telling me that
this was very sad for you very,

01:23:41.945 --> 01:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
very, very much like it kind
of threw you into a depression,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.550 align:middle line:90%
I feel.

01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:49.820 align:middle line:84%
They are talking
about telling me this.

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't really get all the
specifics of this right now,

01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
but they're telling
me with this person,

01:23:55.530 --> 01:24:02.480 align:middle line:84%
that this particular person that
you had this thing with, there

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is sort of like an awakening
happening with this person.

01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:07.975 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
if something changes.

01:24:07.975 --> 01:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you
have the free will

01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:12.570 align:middle line:84%
if you decide you want to
engage in that, just depends.

01:24:12.570 --> 01:24:16.650 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like I'm hearing
there might be something there.

01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So just keep an open mind.

01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not getting all
the timing or date.

01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.197 align:middle line:84%
But they just are
saying that there

01:24:22.197 --> 01:24:23.780 align:middle line:84%
might be the potential
for that person

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to have a change of
heart, or for them to say,

01:24:25.650 --> 01:24:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you know what, oh my god,
I did something wrong.

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So just kind of listen for
that or be open to that.

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't see more
than that, but I

01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
feel like this message
is coming through.

01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:39.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I would like to see,
now I'm just curious.

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.870 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:41.130 align:middle line:90%
Because I think that--

01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:42.963 align:middle line:84%
and let me just see how
we're doing on time.

01:24:42.963 --> 01:24:45.720 align:middle line:90%


01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that may
have been the brother.

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
It was just her dad's brother.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to,
your dad's brother

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
didn't have
neurobiological stuff?

01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> One of his brothers
that passed away did.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, another brother, but not
the one I was talking about?

01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But let's just
still go back here,

01:25:02.610 --> 01:25:05.130 align:middle line:84%
because I sort of feel like
I am connected with one thing

01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:05.740 align:middle line:90%
back here.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.282 align:middle line:84%
So let's just see
if we can get that.

01:25:07.282 --> 01:25:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I've got
one other quick message

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I can bring through.

01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.570 align:middle line:90%
So let's just see here.

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:16.070 align:middle line:90%


01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:18.950 align:middle line:90%
So how do you have this, dear?

01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, my brother, he
had a heart attack.

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Then he had
neurological problems

01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
where he never
regained consciousness.

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.550 align:middle line:90%
But he had swollen legs.

01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:30.470 align:middle line:90%
You hit everything before.

01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:31.370 align:middle line:90%
His name is Thomas.

01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:33.287 align:middle line:84%
His daughter is studying
to be a psychologist.

01:25:33.287 --> 01:25:34.087 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:35.300 align:middle line:90%
>> You hit everything.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:36.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why and financially,
it's horrible right now.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:41.180 align:middle line:90%
So yes, you hit everything.

01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:42.140 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:44.150 align:middle line:90%
So that could have been.

01:25:44.150 --> 01:25:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes,
there are parallels,

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:48.020 align:middle line:84%
especially you're sitting
next to the person.

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:52.430 align:middle line:90%


01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So are you connected
to his kids?

01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:56.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:58.430 align:middle line:90%
Can I just ask one thing here.

01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Does somebody connect
with the name,

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not familiar with this name,
but does somebody have the name

01:26:03.190 --> 01:26:04.776 align:middle line:90%
O-R-I-T?

01:26:04.776 --> 01:26:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Here.

01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that, dear?

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> My daughter.

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Your daughter?

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.090 align:middle line:10%
But this is a living person.

01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.120 align:middle line:90%
There's a lady coming.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.332 align:middle line:10%
Is your mom passed?

01:26:17.332 --> 01:26:18.760 align:middle line:10%
>> She's on her way.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.742 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:21.880 align:middle line:90%
It's weird.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's just go over here.

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm picking
up on something.

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It's weird because that's
such an unusual name.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lady that
I'm getting in the spirit

01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:36.380 align:middle line:90%
world that's coming through.

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.820 align:middle line:90%


01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.215 align:middle line:90%
And there's actually two.

01:26:42.215 --> 01:26:44.075 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:26:44.075 --> 01:26:47.540 align:middle line:90%


01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
They're allowing me psychically
to see your daughter's energy.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
She has a very beautiful
energy, I feel like.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.360 align:middle line:90%
You must be very close to her.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Are you close to her?

01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:58.007 align:middle line:84%
>> They're putting
writing around her.

01:26:58.007 --> 01:26:59.090 align:middle line:90%
She's going to do writing.

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Does she write?

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:01.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Who's Muriel?

01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> My mother.

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:08.750 align:middle line:84%
This lady is coming through
to talk about her, this lady.

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:11.042 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if this could
be like your grandmother.

01:27:11.042 --> 01:27:12.833 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really sure
what the connection is,

01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
but there's a lady
coming through.

01:27:14.250 --> 01:27:16.280 align:middle line:84%
She's having me
reference that name.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's somebody who wants
to talk about your mom.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it is just
your maternal grandmother.

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.500 align:middle line:90%
That's my senses.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
If we had more time,
I would sort of

01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.480 align:middle line:90%
try to build it up more.

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
But I just feel for right
now, I feel energetically this

01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:32.690 align:middle line:90%
is your grandmother.

01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And basically what
they've come to show

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
me is that this woman as
I'm connecting with here,

01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I feel would have
done a lot of cooking.

01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:48.190 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm getting
from this woman.

01:27:48.190 --> 01:27:50.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
though as I'm connecting

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:53.820 align:middle line:84%
that I feel I want to just
go back to this woman here.

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.640 align:middle line:90%
So this lady's coming through.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.220 align:middle line:90%
She's giving me that name.

01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:00.140 align:middle line:84%
You know basically what
they're telling me is, now

01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:01.575 align:middle line:90%
are you involved with your mom?

01:28:01.575 --> 01:28:02.375 align:middle line:90%
Do you?

01:28:02.375 --> 01:28:02.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:02.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So you're dealing with
the stuff with your mom.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:05.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:10.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hearing about is,
and this is just something,

01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:13.210 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of, I
would say, spirits

01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:15.070 align:middle line:90%
that are around her right now.

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:17.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm also picking up on
a male energy that's

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:21.850 align:middle line:84%
coming through connected to
her, feels like a contemporary,

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:24.080 align:middle line:90%
like a brother or a husband.

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:32.050 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say that
people can be in exit points.

01:28:32.050 --> 01:28:32.850 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And an exit point is just
when the soul is deciding,

01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:38.110 align:middle line:84%
do I want to pass or
do I want to stay?

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Am I done here?

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we can have
many exit points.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, we might have 10
exit points in one lifetime.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of times,
and we can choose.

01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.037 align:middle line:84%
And then we go on
to the next one.

01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm feeling
with this one, what

01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:58.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm hearing is that your
mom, she is in an exit point.

01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like the
spirits are kind of they're

01:29:01.180 --> 01:29:02.530 align:middle line:90%
gathering around her.

01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:05.470 align:middle line:84%
This could go on
for several months.

01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
They're telling me
for some reason,

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
and I don't really understand
fully this message,

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.290 align:middle line:84%
but they're telling me to
organize everything prior.

01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I almost
feel like I need somebody.

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:18.298 align:middle line:84%
It's like I don't
know, like I feel

01:29:18.298 --> 01:29:20.590 align:middle line:84%
like there's things to go
through papers to go through,

01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.980 align:middle line:90%
paper.

01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:22.010 align:middle line:90%
I just I'm hearing this.

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:24.573 align:middle line:84%
I actually see like shuffling
of papers, things like that.

01:29:24.573 --> 01:29:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So just know that
that's coming through.

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
they're supporting you

01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
as you deal with this.

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:31.660 align:middle line:90%
I want to ask you this too.

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.850 align:middle line:90%


01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Hold on one second.

01:29:37.670 --> 01:29:39.655 align:middle line:90%
Is there a New York connection?

01:29:39.655 --> 01:29:40.530 align:middle line:90%
People from New York?

01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Mm-hmm, my mother
and father and sister.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Did your grandparents
live there?

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:46.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.548 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, because I
am seeing New York.

01:29:48.548 --> 01:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
This lady that's
coming through again

01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm seeing New York, New York.

01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But I want to say
like I was saying,

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
they're just telling me this
is a time of organization.

01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a time to kind
of look into things.

01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I feel like they just want
to bring that through to you.

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:05.270 align:middle line:84%
So just I think it's more
just a validation for you

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that sort of they know what
you're going through and just

01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:14.000 align:middle line:84%
