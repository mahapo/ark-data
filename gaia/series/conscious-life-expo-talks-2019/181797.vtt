00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's talk is about the
fractal holographic universe

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.730 align:middle line:10%
theory.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to bring forward some
information about this theory

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.418 align:middle line:84%
that you may or may
not have known before.

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of
people probably will

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.502 align:middle line:84%
be shocked by some
of the information

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:90%
that I bring forward.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And see how I present it and
how it relates to us, not only

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
from the distant past, and our
current time, and then, again,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.400 align:middle line:84%
going into the future, what is
the future of sentient beings

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.188 align:middle line:90%
in the multiverse.

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:33.730 align:middle line:10%
So I'll just start
off by telling you

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.647 align:middle line:10%
a little bit about myself
for those of you who

00:00:35.647 --> 00:00:37.863 align:middle line:10%
may not know about me.

00:00:37.863 --> 00:00:39.655 align:middle line:84%
I am the founder of
forbidden knowledge dot

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:41.472 align:middle line:90%
com with the number 4.

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a website, and a
blog, and social media

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that I started back
in around 2011,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.642 align:middle line:84%
and now has kind of grown into
kind of a semi-phenomenon.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But along with
forbidden knowledge,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
it's sprung off a lot
of other entities,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:84%
or social media accounts, and
other websites, and blogs.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
All in total I have
over 130 social media

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
accounts that cover everything
from ancient history, sciences,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:84%
quantum physics, metaphysics,
vortex mathematics,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.377 align:middle line:84%
plant-based alternatives,
Anunnaki history, sports.

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the list goes on and on.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:84%
I've got a very,
very huge network,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
including of course, YouTube,
and many other networks.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
All and told, between
all of my accounts,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I have a little over
3 million people

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that follow the information
that I'm putting out.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.380 align:middle line:10%
So I really want
to thank everybody

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:10%
that has supported taking part,
that has followed, subscribed,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:10%
or whatever, and
just kind of help

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:10%
me progress and put
out this information

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:10%
and share it worldwide.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm also on a series
called "Deep Space"

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.558 align:middle line:10%
on Gaia TV, season 1 and 2.

00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:10%
There's another season filming.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.910 align:middle line:10%
I'll be on that one.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:10%
And there's also
"Ancient Civilizations"

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:10%
that I've been on as
well, season 1 and 2.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm in the process
of writing and completing

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.843 align:middle line:10%
a series that I'll be doing on
Gaia under their Ascension tab

00:01:59.843 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:10%
which is going to be talking
about knowledge for ascension

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.070 align:middle line:10%
with Billy Carson.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:10%
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:10%
And I want to thank
Gaia for being

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:10%
able to live stream this
information around the world,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.150 align:middle line:10%
and giving people an opportunity
to log in and be able to learn,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:10%
and help raise their
consciousness if they couldn't

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:10%
have a way to get here.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:10%
So that's an amazing feat.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And I want to thank
Gaia for doing that.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm also the co-founder
of the United

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.030 align:middle line:10%
Family of Anomaly Hunters.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.110 align:middle line:10%
And I'll give you a
quick history about that.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:10%
About probably in
2010 going into 2011,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:10%
I got into looking
for space anomalies.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:10%
And I got into this
through this site

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.910 align:middle line:10%
called "Worldwide Telescope."

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.535 align:middle line:10%
So I went to
WorldwideTelescope.org.

00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:42.910 align:middle line:10%
And it was a very
interesting way

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:10%
that I was given
this information.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.450 align:middle line:10%
But I got the
information nonetheless.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:10%
And I started researching
space anomalies.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.735 align:middle line:10%
And when you go into
WorldwideTelescope.org,

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:10%
at that time, you had
to download software

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:10%
onto your computer.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.622 align:middle line:10%
So I downloaded the
software, installed it.

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:00.330 align:middle line:10%
And as soon as I opened
it up, I realized

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.400 align:middle line:10%
I was in our solar system
looking through all the space

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:10%
probes and rovers,
all the space data

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.197 align:middle line:10%
that we've acquired over
many decades is in that site.

00:03:10.197 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And you get a chance to
not only analyze the data,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.697 align:middle line:10%
but you can actually-- it gives
you the sense as if you're

00:03:14.697 --> 00:03:17.988 align:middle line:10%
actually visiting the
rover or the space probe

00:03:17.988 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:10%
and looking through its camera.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:10%
That's the perspective that you
get, the perspective that it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:10%
took the images or video from.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:10%
So it's absolutely amazing.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:10%
Through this research that
I just kind of stumbled on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.332 align:middle line:10%
in a way, I discovered
anomalies on Mars.

00:03:34.332 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:10%
And when I discovered anomalies
on Mars, these objects that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.498 align:middle line:10%
were on the surface
of Mars that appeared

00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:10%
to be similar objects to
what we would recognize

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.050 align:middle line:10%
as being objects on Earth.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.930 align:middle line:10%
That's when I started to really
question the nature of reality

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:10%
itself, and figuring out,
OK, there's things there

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.600 align:middle line:10%
and things here that
kind of look the same.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:10%
How could this be?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:10%
And that took me down the
rabbit hole so, as they say,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.500 align:middle line:10%
looking for information as to
how another civilization can

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.300 align:middle line:10%
establish itself
on another planet

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:10%
and have similar
objects to ours.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:10%
And that took me to looking
into the ancient past.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:10%
Because obviously what I thought
I was seeing was very, very old

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:10%
and partially destroyed.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:10%
And I said, it's
got to be ancient.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:10%
That's when I started looking
into ancient tablets--

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Sumerian tablets,
Emerald tablets,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:10%
Mahabharata, Bog Raghida,
the Indian Vedas,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:10%
all these different sources
of ancient information.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:10%
And then I sort of realizing
that, from the perspective

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:10%
of the people that put
this information out,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.740 align:middle line:10%
these civilizations
were not only real,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:10%
they were here, not only
in our solar system,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:10%
but also intergalactically.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:10%
People were actually even
traveling from galaxy

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:10%
to galaxy at one point.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:10%
There were space battles.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.085 align:middle line:10%
There's a reason why Mars
is called the god of war.

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:10%
After you analyze it
more, you discover

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:10%
that there's xenon
in the atmosphere,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.827 align:middle line:10%
weapons-grade xenon, which
is a nuclear signature.

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:10%
So you realize that
there was a lot going on

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient past.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:10%
And the more I dug
into the ancient past,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:10%
I've started to
discover that there's

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:10%
a lot of truth and reality,
in my personal opinion,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:10%
based on what I've
seen on Earth,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:10%
and based on what I've seen now
in space, that these anomalies

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.950 align:middle line:10%
are actually real.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.177 align:middle line:10%
And that they're evidence of
a very, very highly advanced

00:05:18.177 --> 00:05:20.260 align:middle line:10%
culture which we're going
to touch on a little bit

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:10%
today because they
have a lot to do

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:10%
with the nature of our reality.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.238 align:middle line:10%
By the way, shameless
plug, I did write a book.

00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:10%
The book is called "Compendium
of the Emerald Tablets."

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.330 align:middle line:90%
It is here.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:90%
We have about 40 books here.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the limited
edition version.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.893 align:middle line:84%
They'll be autographed for
you at the end of the show.

00:05:38.893 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
If you want to meet me
right outside the door.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm of course sure somebody else
will have to come up in here.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:43.892 align:middle line:90%
I can meet you out there.

00:05:43.892 --> 00:05:45.978 align:middle line:84%
And we'll autograph the
books and get them to you.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:90%
So the book is available.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:10%
But it covers everything from
holographic universe theory,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.310 align:middle line:10%
quantum physics, quantum
mechanics, metaphysics.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:10%
It goes into what we're
talking about today.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:10%
And it talks about
how the ancient past

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:10%
is tied into the present day
and also into the future.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.325 align:middle line:10%
And it breaks down
the Emerald tablets

00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:10%
almost section by
section and gives you

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:10%
a better understanding of
exactly what's being said,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:10%
what's being told,
and what the lessons

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:10%
need to be learned from there.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:10%
So if you're
interested in the book,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:10%
it definitely is available.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.460 align:middle line:10%
But at the end, I will
go out in the hallway

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.402 align:middle line:10%
and I can make those
available to you.

00:06:15.402 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:10%
One of the things I
pride myself on doing

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.230 align:middle line:10%
is I pride myself on
traveling around the world

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:10%
and getting out to these sites.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.380 align:middle line:10%
As I became a researcher of
all of these ancient sites

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.420 align:middle line:10%
and realizing that
they really correlated

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.110 align:middle line:10%
to modern technology and
current day, I said to myself,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.905 align:middle line:10%
I've got to get out
there in the field.

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And I pride myself on that.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not that I'm
bragging about it,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:10%
but I want people to know
that I feel it is very, very

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.553 align:middle line:10%
important for me,
at least, that I'm

00:06:44.553 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:10%
a researcher that gets out
and gets his hands dirty.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:10%
I want to go out to places.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:10%
I want to smell, and
feel, and touch them.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.933 align:middle line:10%
Do my own research,
my own investigation.

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.350 align:middle line:10%
I want to talk to
homegrown people

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.517 align:middle line:10%
that grew up in those areas.

00:06:54.517 --> 00:06:56.225 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out
what they have to say,

00:06:56.225 --> 00:06:57.280 align:middle line:90%
what their legends are.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.322 align:middle line:90%
I want to talk to shamen.

00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to
spiritual leaders.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.560 align:middle line:10%
I want to get in
these people's faces.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I set out
to do as I began to take

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.288 align:middle line:10%
this as a real serious way.

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to call it
a hobby, because I really

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:10%
call it an ascension mission.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.342 align:middle line:10%
As I began to take on
this ascension mission,

00:07:14.342 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:10%
I really felt like
it was something

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:10%
that I really had to get
involved with and do.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.532 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to show
you a couple of photos

00:07:19.532 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:10%
of myself traveling.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:10%
This here is a photo at the
top of Machu Picchu, which was

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:10%
taken this September, actually.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:10%
It was on my birthday.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And me and my beautiful
fiancee are actually

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:90%
standing here at the edge.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
about a 250 meter drop

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.603 align:middle line:84%
right there at the edge
of where we're standing.

00:07:37.603 --> 00:07:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Literally just
drops straight off.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually hundreds
of people in this photo.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That's how high up we
are, about 12,500 feet.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:10%
The people are the size of ants
down there in the city below,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:10%
which is still about 11,000
feet above sea level.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.638 align:middle line:10%
So this place is a
massive, massive--

00:07:58.638 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:10%
I like to call it
an ancient airport.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.263 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like a place
where people would meet up.

00:08:02.263 --> 00:08:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost like going
to the LAX, in a way,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times, to
be honest with you.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.720 align:middle line:90%
And when you look at--

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.520 align:middle line:90%
yeah, I'm serious.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.687 align:middle line:84%
When you start reading a
lot of these ancient texts,

00:08:12.687 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:84%
you realize that the gods
the quote, unquote "gods"

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.900 align:middle line:84%
always dwelled at the
tops of mountains.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And their ships were always
seen going from mountain

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.010 align:middle line:90%
to mountain.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And they would travel from place
to place on these mountaintops.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
Of course, due to
security reasons,

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and staying away
from other indigenous

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:90%
beings, and so forth and so on.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.629 align:middle line:84%
But this place just resonates
high tech everywhere

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:34.429 align:middle line:90%
when you go there.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing place.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:10%
And if you can ever make it
there, I highly recommend it.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
This is me there now
down in the city area.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can see, if you
look at the back top,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.760 align:middle line:90%
we were all the way up there.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So this place is
a massive place.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And you can barely
see the people there.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.997 align:middle line:90%
Something happened there.

00:08:54.997 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So I figured, we're
as close to the gods

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
as you can possibly get.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And if I get down
on one knee here,

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.570 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of her saying
no would probably be very low.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.053 align:middle line:10%
I was weighing my odds.

00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:20.470 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, if she did say
no, I could just roll myself

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:21.752 align:middle line:10%
off the edge right there.

00:09:21.752 --> 00:09:22.812 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.020 align:middle line:10%
And be like, I'm out of here.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.470 align:middle line:10%
It's time to ascend.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] So luckily, she
said, yes, thank you.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:10%
I appreciate you.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:10%
I love you, babe.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:10%
And that was a great trip.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.200 align:middle line:10%
This is us in Cambodia.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.060 align:middle line:10%
We went to Cambodia.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:48.010 align:middle line:10%
We went hiking 37
miles in 100% humidity,

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:10%
120 degrees per day weather
through the jungles of Cambodia

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:10%
on 500 hectares of land.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And this was actually
towards the end of the trip.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:90%
We almost didn't take this shot.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.837 align:middle line:10%
One of the reasons
why I proposed to her

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:03.370 align:middle line:10%
was because she never complained
one time on this trip.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.503 align:middle line:10%
And this was a brutal,
brutal attack on the senses.

00:10:07.503 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:10%
This trip was a beautiful
place, don't get me wrong.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:10%
But wow, the heat
and the humidity

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:10%
were a little overwhelming
at times for a lot of people.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.240 align:middle line:10%
But this was a beautiful place.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And we got to go
into Angkor Wat.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.380 align:middle line:10%
This is Angkor Wat behind us.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:10%
Go into Angkor Wat, go up into
the upper levels of the temple.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Got blessed by monks
and everything else.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.422 align:middle line:10%
So it was just an amazing
experience to go there.

00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:30.880 align:middle line:10%
But also to witness
the technology.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.370 align:middle line:10%
Because one of the things
that you understand here

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.032 align:middle line:10%
is that the ancients or
the people that are there,

00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:10%
their legends are that this
temple was poured into place

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.410 align:middle line:10%
and it was built in
a day and a night.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:10%
And it's super massive,
a super massive temple.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:10%
So it's an amazing place.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:47.630 align:middle line:90%
The energy there is outstanding.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.815 align:middle line:90%
This is Coral Castle in Miami.

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So some people
say, well, I never

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.940 align:middle line:84%
get a chance to go to
these ancient sites.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a place in
Florida, down in Miami, called

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Coral Castle, and I highly
recommend you go there.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:10%
Because a man by the name
of Edward Leedskalnin, who's

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:10%
only about 4 foot 9 and
weighed about maybe 110 pounds,

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.608 align:middle line:10%
built a megalithic
castle in Miami, Florida,

00:11:07.608 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:10%
which still stands today.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.180 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a museum.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:10%
You can go there and
you can visit this place

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:10%
and see some amazing
stone work done

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:10%
by a man who can probably
barely lift this podium that I'm

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:10%
standing at.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:10%
And he used advanced technology
that he learned from,

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:10%
according to him, from Egypt.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.920 align:middle line:10%
He learned the secrets of how
to reverse the magnetic polarity

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.700 align:middle line:10%
of stone, and cut them, and
maneuver them into place

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.788 align:middle line:10%
through ancient technology.

00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's an amazing
place to go visit,

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:10%
the Coral Castle in Miami.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:10%
I've been to, here
on the far left,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.610 align:middle line:10%
that is Tulum, down in Mexico.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Tulum was an amazing place.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a megalithic city built
on the edge of a cliff, which

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:90%
overlooks the Gulf.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, the second one is
down into the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
actually the next two, down
into the Yucatan Peninsula,

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
into Chichen Itza to
see these pyramids.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.093 align:middle line:84%
That was my return to
Chichen Itza after 20 years.

00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:06.010 align:middle line:84%
My first time being back
there after 20 years,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
to give me an idea how long
I've been exploring places.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of aging
myself here now.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But back then, the
first time I went,

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.575 align:middle line:90%
you could climb to the top.

00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't climb to the top
anymore, because of some things

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
some tourists did,
unfortunately.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:90%
This is me in Tula, Mexico.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:84%
This is at the
top of the Pyramid

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:90%
of Cuicuilco or Quetzalcoatl.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Or if you want to
call them Viracocha

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.917 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you
want to call them.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a throne from
Egypt, same person.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But I'm standing
next to his guards

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.102 align:middle line:90%
at the top of his pyramid.

00:12:37.102 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And each one of
these, you probably

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.810 align:middle line:90%
can't really see it from here.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:84%
They are each holding
a technological device

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:90%
in their hands.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And they have backpacks on.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they have chest
plates on, which

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.010 align:middle line:90%
are very, very, very advanced.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
The second picture
to the right, I'm

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:58.220 align:middle line:84%
actually 2 meters down in a
cave in Cachuamilpa, Mexico.

00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:90%
That's where I was.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Down there, there's
actual carvings

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of Egyptian faces, the
motif, like 90 meters

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
up above the floor of the cave.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing place.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.973 align:middle line:90%
And we could have kept going.

00:13:10.973 --> 00:13:11.890 align:middle line:90%
It almost doesn't end.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But because of
lack of oxygen, you

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:84%
have to turn back and walk
back towards the entrance.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you
start to suffocate.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:84%
There were some graves
down there, by the way.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Some people didn't make it.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.282 align:middle line:84%
This is me standing on top of
the Pyramid of the Moon right

00:13:25.282 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
in front of the
Avenue of the Dead.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And behind me is the
Pyramid of the Sun, which

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.900 align:middle line:90%
is the largest pyramid there.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that Pyramid of
the Sun is exactly 50%

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
the height of the Pyramid at
Giza and the same exact size

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.060 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Here I am at Giza at the Great
Pyramid standing out front.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, on the
second picture, I'm

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:48.023 align:middle line:84%
actually on the inside
of the Great Pyramid,

00:13:48.023 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
inside the King's
Chamber, looking

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
at what they call
the sarcophagus,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
which actually is
not a sarcophagus.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The dimensions of this box
are the same exact dimensions

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Ark of the
Covenant that's

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.170 align:middle line:84%
spoken about in the
Bible and biblical texts.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It would fit
directly in this box.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And you see that chunk
that's missing on the corner?

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, across the other
side of the room, which

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
you can't see from
that perspective,

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that chunk flew off,
and it hit the wall,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:84%
and left a dent
in the exact shape

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.612 align:middle line:84%
that it hit, a
dent in that wall,

00:14:18.612 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:84%
because of an explosion
that happened in there.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.778 align:middle line:84%
Probably an energetic
explosion happened at some time

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:90%
in the distant past.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it was.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But this box is talked about
in the Emerald tablets.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.150 align:middle line:90%
Thoth talks about it.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And he talks about
how it can create

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:90%
a multidimensional portal.

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can travel from
one place to another.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
So the Great Pyramid
of Giza, which

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
a little bit today

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about the
fractal holographic universe,

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
was a multidimensional
multifunctional stone computer

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.160 align:middle line:84%
that was capable of not only
generating wireless power

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.220 align:middle line:90%
electricity.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It was also capable
of generating portals.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:84%
It was capable of
transmitting sound and voices

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.187 align:middle line:84%
through obelisk technology
around the planet.

00:14:56.187 --> 00:14:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's very interesting
place, and a very amazing place

00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:90%
to visit.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.202 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking some people there
this year on a tour, as well.

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm inside the King's
Chamber again here.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But I just wanted to
point something out

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
before I proceeded to
the actual information

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.257 align:middle line:90%
about the holographic universe.

00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The King's Chamber, the
speed of light in a vacuum

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.243 align:middle line:90%
is 299,792 meters per second.

00:15:17.243 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing I
want to say about this.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
People say, how can this
be meters per second?

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.610 align:middle line:84%
How can meters per second be
real in ancient times, when

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
we just discovered
meters in modern times?

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look into
the Sumerian tablets,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and go to proto
Sumerian, you discover

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Sumerians already had a
metric system in ancient times.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking 8,000
to 10,000 years ago,

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
the metric system
already existed.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
proto Sumerian tablets

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that have that
mathematical meter system

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
have been discovered right here
in America, down in Mexico.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.010 align:middle line:90%
Go figure.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Again, evidence that
these civilizations

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:84%
traveled from Mesopotamia to
the Americas and back and forth.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
The Atlantean civilization, as
we'll talk about a little bit

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.020 align:middle line:84%
today, was a global
civilization, probably

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.707 align:middle line:84%
most likely
interplanetary, not just

00:16:06.707 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:84%
a ring city sitting in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:10%
This is me at the
top of Ollantaytambo.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a great photo
here that I love.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.575 align:middle line:84%
It's really at the
top of a mountain.

00:16:20.575 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And getting up there
is kind of brutal.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:90%
The air is very, very thin.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.303 align:middle line:90%
And this is me at--

00:16:26.303 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people like to
call this Sacsayhuaman

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
or sexy woman, is how
they like to say it.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:90%
But Sacsayhuaman in Peru.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there
with our guide, Elvis.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
That's his actually real name.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.212 align:middle line:90%
His real name is Elvis.

00:16:39.212 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:84%
But look at the size of
those blocks behind me.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm 6 foot 4.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.450 align:middle line:84%
You can see the mass of these
stones and these blocks.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:10%
And you see this same exact
technology being used worldwide

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:10%
on a global scale.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:10%
So now that we've gone
over that a little

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:10%
bit and showed, just trying
to show you that I really

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:10%
have gone and done a
lot of field research

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.535 align:middle line:10%
to come up with a lot of
these theories, and ideas,

00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:02.417 align:middle line:10%
and concepts.

00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:04.000 align:middle line:10%
It's not like I just
rolled out of bed

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.292 align:middle line:10%
one day in a robe and slippers
and said, you know what?

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:10%
I think this is what happened.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:10%
And that's the point that
I'm trying to make to you.

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:10%
I think it's very important
that you have to understand,

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:10%
it's not one of those things.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.325 align:middle line:10%
Oh, this guy just
reads Google all day,

00:17:17.325 --> 00:17:18.970 align:middle line:10%
and now he's up here on a stage.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:10%
I really put a lot of blood,
sweat, tears, and years,

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.390 align:middle line:10%
and dedication into learning
this information, this content,

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.557 align:middle line:10%
and trying to put together
the pieces of the puzzle.

00:17:27.557 --> 00:17:29.920 align:middle line:10%
Because I see things a lot
differently than most people.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.337 align:middle line:10%
And that's given
me the capability

00:17:31.337 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:10%
to help paint pictures.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:10%
This picture I took at the Field
Museum in Chicago, actually.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:10%
And there's a fractal
holographic scene

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.090 align:middle line:10%
there at the Field
Museum in Chicago,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.490 align:middle line:10%
where you can actually go
and learn about fractals.

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:10%
And you can see fractals
on computer screens.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.845 align:middle line:10%
And you can find out how they
work, and how they develop,

00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:56.470 align:middle line:10%
and how the nature of
our reality is fractal.

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:10%
So we're living in
a fractal universe.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:10%
And this is science
peer reviewed fact.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:10%
It's not even a mystery.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:10%
It's not, oh, my god, I
wonder if this could be real?

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.100 align:middle line:10%
Are fractals a real thing?

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to tell
you that fractals

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.510 align:middle line:10%
are a peer reviewed science.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.705 align:middle line:10%
It's not even a mystery.

00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of
fact, the majority

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:10%
of the video games that your
kids are probably playing,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.780 align:middle line:10%
and your grandchildren
play, for some of you,

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.190 align:middle line:10%
are all based on fractal
mathematics, which we're going

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.838 align:middle line:10%
to go into a little bit today.

00:18:23.838 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want people to
understand something.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.637 align:middle line:10%
When I say that we're living in
a fractal holographic universe,

00:18:28.637 --> 00:18:30.220 align:middle line:10%
the first thing that
sometimes happens

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:10%
is people start to say, well,
if it means I'm not real,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.540 align:middle line:10%
if I'm living in a hologram.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:10%
That's not exactly it.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:10%
What I'm trying to say is,
the nature of the reality,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:10%
for what it is set up
and formed and created,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:10%
is a fractal and
both holographic.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean
that you're not real.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean your
thoughts aren't real

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.783 align:middle line:90%
and your kids aren't real.

00:18:49.783 --> 00:18:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean we're
not really here today.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:84%
What it really means
is that the method used

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
for the creation
of this dimension

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.180 align:middle line:84%
that we're occupying
right now consciously was,

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.340 align:middle line:84%
this is the method that
was used to create it.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.160 align:middle line:10%
In other words, I'm
giving you a sneak peek

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:10%
into the software program
developed by a divine creator.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:10%
This is what we're
looking at right here, OK?

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:10%
And so when you read some
of these ancient texts,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:10%
and that everybody
from every religion

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.147 align:middle line:10%
and every different
type of spirituality

00:19:18.147 --> 00:19:20.800 align:middle line:10%
is talking about we're living
in a creation, guess what?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.982 align:middle line:90%
They're all correct.

00:19:21.982 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
they're all correct.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.790 align:middle line:90%
We are living in a creation.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:10%
What I'm attempting
to do here today

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:10%
is show you how this
creation came to be

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.600 align:middle line:10%
and what method was
used to create it.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:10%
What is a fractal?

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at the exact
definition of a fractal

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:10%
and why it's important.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:10%
A fractal is a curve
or geometric figure,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:10%
each part of which has the
same statistical character

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:10%
as the whole.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:10%
Fractals are useful
in modeling structures

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:10%
such as eroded
coastlines or snowflakes,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.050 align:middle line:10%
in which similar patterns
recur at progressively

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:10%
smaller scales.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:10%
And in describing partly
random chaotic phenomena,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:10%
such as crystal growth, fluid
turbulence, and the most

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:10%
important, galaxy formation.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.300 align:middle line:10%
So fractals are responsible
for galaxy formation.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:10%
So that should raise
a bell right there.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.803 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
something that's

00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:10%
very, very important
because we're

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:10%
talking about the creation
that we're living in, as well.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're living in
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Milky Way galaxy can
be broken down into fractals.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to go over
that a little bit today.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
18 quadrillion planets
in one video game.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:10%
One video that fits on the
size of a DVD can be played.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
is because, when

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:10%
you're using a fractal
pattern, the next frame only

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:10%
appears as you need it.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're on a video
game, and you're playing,

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
as you get through
the different levels.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, I've got to go back
to Donkey Kong or Pac-Man,

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:10%
because I can't even
operate these joysticks.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:10%
I need the Atari 2600,
one stick and one button.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:10%
But you would go
through the Donkey Kong.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:10%
And as you got to different
levels, all of a sudden,

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.913 align:middle line:10%
the next screen would appear.

00:20:59.913 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:10%
I've made to this, OK.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:10%
Now I've got to
fight this guy and I

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:10%
gotta try to jump
over these things,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:10%
or whatever the case may be.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Same thing with Pac-Man.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.200 align:middle line:10%
So as you go through
the different areas,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:10%
it just keeps evolving.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.940 align:middle line:10%
But the reason why
it keeps evolving

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:14.653 align:middle line:10%
is because what happens is, like
we are here on this real life,

00:21:14.653 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:10%
the next frame appears
when you need it.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:10%
So right now, we're all here.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And everything else
outside of here

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:10%
that you can't see physically
with your eyeballs,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:10%
our rudimentary senses,
doesn't even exist.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.400 align:middle line:10%
It only exists as
electromagnetic waves.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:10%
Everything really truly only
is an electromagnetic wave.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.590 align:middle line:10%
Right now, passing
through this entire area

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:10%
are trillions and
quadrillions of

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.700 align:middle line:10%
these electromagnetic
frequencies

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:10%
that are just passing through.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:10%
What happens?

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:10%
How does it collapse into
something that we decipher,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.830 align:middle line:10%
that you see me up here,
and I see you down there,

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and you see this screen here,
and so forth, and so on?

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.620 align:middle line:10%
It's an illusion.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.912 align:middle line:10%
It's a very elaborate illusion.

00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is, when
you look at the double slit

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:10%
experiment in quantum
physics, and you

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:10%
discover that when
you look at an object,

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:10%
an atom, the actual
object of looking

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:10%
at it, conscious
observation, changes

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:10%
the direction, and the
vibration, and frequency,

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:10%
or the position of the atom.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:10%
So you're talking about now
conscious observation changing

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:10%
reality, collapsing
reality into something

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:10%
we call digital matter.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.370 align:middle line:10%
So I'll give you an example.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.167 align:middle line:10%
The human brain is
encased in darkness.

00:22:22.167 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:10%
It's inside of your skull.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:10%
It can't see, smell,
touch, hear, feel anything.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.220 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't know that
anything exists anywhere.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:10%
But what it does, the human
brain, it has friends.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:10%
So it says to its
friends, hey, you guys,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:10%
I want you to go out
there and collect

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:10%
some information for me.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:10%
Collect me some data.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:10%
These friends, sight, hearing,
seeing, smelling, touch,

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.730 align:middle line:10%
feeling-- all the senses--

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:43.587 align:middle line:10%
they all go out.

00:22:43.587 --> 00:22:45.420 align:middle line:10%
They start collecting
information, literally

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:10%
zeros and ones, bits of data.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:10%
They themselves, these friends,
they literally cannot decipher

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.270 align:middle line:10%
what they're collecting.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.070 align:middle line:10%
They have no idea.

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:10%
They're just getting
the information,

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.197 align:middle line:10%
just getting it all together.

00:22:56.197 --> 00:22:57.780 align:middle line:10%
They bring it back
to the brain that's

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.200 align:middle line:10%
totally encased in darkness.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:10%
And then, guess what happens?

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.790 align:middle line:10%
The brain puts it all
together, figures it

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.810 align:middle line:10%
all out within a split second.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.100 align:middle line:10%
And then it projects a hologram
of what's going on out there.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's how you navigate
through the third dimension.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:10%
You're navigating through
projected holograms

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:10%
from conscious technology.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's how we're
all here right now.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.030 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:10%
So this is the power
of consciousness.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:10%
And in true reality, like I was
talking about the other day,

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm not even up
here talking to you.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking to myself.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.308 align:middle line:10%
And when you're
talking to somebody,

00:23:31.308 --> 00:23:32.600 align:middle line:10%
you're not talking to somebody.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.828 align:middle line:10%
You're talking to yourself.

00:23:34.828 --> 00:23:36.120 align:middle line:10%
There's only one consciousness.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:10%
There's only one entity.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.190 align:middle line:10%
There's only one being.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.250 align:middle line:10%
There's only one
it, one divinity.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.000 align:middle line:10%
And what has happened,
it's divided itself

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:10%
into trillions and
trillions of entities

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.290 align:middle line:10%
throughout the entire universe
so that it can experience

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:10%
itself subjectively from
different perspectives,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:10%
different angles, different
mindsets, different thought

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.710 align:middle line:10%
processes, different feelings,
and so forth and so on.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:10%
Because why?

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:55.650 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:59.920 align:middle line:10%
So consciousness itself
is collecting data.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So what are we doing here?

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.220 align:middle line:10%
We are the friends
of consciousness.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.328 align:middle line:10%
We are part of it.

00:24:04.328 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:10%
And we are out here
collecting information.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:10%
That is our mission.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:10%
We collect data and
information through our lives,

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.500 align:middle line:10%
through our interactions.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.120 align:middle line:10%
And we send that
information streaming

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.442 align:middle line:10%
back through consciousness
back to the source.

00:24:14.442 --> 00:24:15.900 align:middle line:10%
We're on a data
collection mission.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.700 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Because consciousness is trying
to experience these dimensions

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.040 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.790 align:middle line:10%
And that's what this
whole thing is about.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:10%
That's what the big
experiment is all about.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:10%
It's a giant
conscious experiment.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.768 align:middle line:10%
The same way that it
works on the highest level

00:24:28.768 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:10%
is the same way it works
here at the lowest level

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:10%
inside of our own minds.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.027 align:middle line:10%
We literally project
our own holograms.

00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:10%
And we create our
own reality tunnels.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.143 align:middle line:10%
Collectively, we
co-create reality

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:10%
through the divinity that flows
in us, through us, and out

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.360 align:middle line:10%
of us.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:10%
Through this consciousness,
this conscious energy.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.330 align:middle line:10%
But individually, we also
have to create our own reality

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:10%
tunnels.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:48.927 align:middle line:10%
And this is what a
lot of people, they

00:24:48.927 --> 00:24:50.010 align:middle line:10%
don't know and understand.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.468 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
talking about things

00:24:51.468 --> 00:24:55.913 align:middle line:84%
like the law of attraction
and how it works.

00:24:55.913 --> 00:24:57.830 align:middle line:84%
This all has to do with
the holographic nature

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:10%
All of it has to do with tapping
into the software, the software

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:10%
programming which
we're going to go over

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:10%
a little bit in a minute.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:10%
What program are
we operating in?

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.570 align:middle line:10%
We're operating in
literal programming

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:10%
that has built this realm
that we're operating in.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:10%
And you can manifest things
here through thought.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:10%
Because conscious thought is
what powers this whole system.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.848 align:middle line:10%
So through this
conscious thought,

00:25:18.848 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:10%
if you need something,
or desire something,

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.723 align:middle line:10%
or have to have something,
whether it's a healing,

00:25:22.723 --> 00:25:25.110 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's a situation,
wherever the case may be,

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.230 align:middle line:10%
you have to meet consciousness
at its highest frequency for it

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.550 align:middle line:10%
to manifest.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.250 align:middle line:10%
So when people are--

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:10%
every day, there's 7.5
billion people on this planet.

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Out of this 7.5
billion people, 85.9%

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:10%
of the people that live on
this planet are religious.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Out of those 89.5% people, there
are trillions and trillions

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of prayers going up every day.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:10%
Every single day.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.800 align:middle line:10%
Trillions of prayers.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:10%
Because if I pray two
or three times a day,

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:10%
even if you're saying,
oh, god, help me,

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.062 align:middle line:10%
this is whatever it is.

00:25:59.062 --> 00:26:01.520 align:middle line:10%
Trillions of prayers going up
a day when you multiply that.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:10%
And the state of the
world is, in some places,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.483 align:middle line:10%
is extremely,
extremely horrible.

00:26:06.483 --> 00:26:08.400 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people are
not getting the things

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.920 align:middle line:10%
that they're
wishing to manifest.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
they can't do it.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.110 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're using
the wrong software code.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:10%
The code that they're
using does not work.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.567 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't interface with
the existing programming.

00:26:21.567 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:10%
The programming language
of the law of attraction,

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:10%
the holographic matrix, is
high frequency programming.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.360 align:middle line:84%
You must meet and
match the frequency

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to quantum entangle with
the universal source,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.340 align:middle line:84%
with the universal
consciousness,

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to allow yourself
to manifest things.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.460 align:middle line:10%
Let me explain what I mean here.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:10%
So if you're in a
position of begging,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:10%
you're begging, begging,
please help me with this,

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.800 align:middle line:10%
please, I need that, please,
I can't, I am sick, help me,

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.610 align:middle line:10%
heal me.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.277 align:middle line:10%
Please help, I can't
pay my car payment.

00:26:47.277 --> 00:26:49.910 align:middle line:10%
Whatever it is, that is a
low frequency vibration.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.348 align:middle line:10%
This is scientifically proven.

00:26:51.348 --> 00:26:53.390 align:middle line:10%
This isn't even a mystery
where I'm just guessing

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.265 align:middle line:10%
and I'm making it up.

00:26:54.265 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:10%
This is real peer
reviewed science.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.202 align:middle line:10%
That type of thought process, if
you put a scanner on your brain

00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:01.660 align:middle line:10%
or nodes on your brain and look
at it on a computer screen,

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.060 align:middle line:10%
it's going to give you a
very wide cosine range.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:10%
As it passes across and in and
throughout your body, and also

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.535 align:middle line:10%
runs across your DNA.

00:27:10.535 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:10%
When you're operating
in high frequency

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.260 align:middle line:10%
where you're commanding,
you're coming

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.300 align:middle line:10%
from a point of knowing
that it is already done.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.753 align:middle line:10%
Now your brainwaves operate
on a shorter cosine frequency,

00:27:20.753 --> 00:27:22.420 align:middle line:10%
if you know what that
is in mathematics.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:10%
And you have more
touches on your DNA

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.950 align:middle line:10%
as these frequencies
come through you

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:10%
and go out of your body.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.880 align:middle line:10%
So now you're operating at a
higher scientific frequency

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.470 align:middle line:10%
through your brain, through your
consciousness, through the way

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.400 align:middle line:10%
you're thinking.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.380 align:middle line:10%
And when I say, it is
done, I'm talking about,

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.040 align:middle line:10%
when you're saying,
I need something.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.730 align:middle line:10%
Like for example, on my
way here, every time I

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.330 align:middle line:10%
get on an airplane, I never
go, please so-and-so, deity,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:10%
please help me arrive
at my destination safely

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.075 align:middle line:10%
and that nothing happens to me.

00:27:47.075 --> 00:27:47.950 align:middle line:10%
That's low frequency.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.180 align:middle line:10%
Doesn't work.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.870 align:middle line:10%
I say, I command and
bless my path on my way

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:53.680 align:middle line:10%
to my destination.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:10%
And then I visualize my path.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:10%
I visualize the exact
path that I'm taking

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:58.728 align:middle line:10%
to get to these destinations.

00:27:58.728 --> 00:28:00.520 align:middle line:10%
And I say, I will arrive safely.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:10%
In other words, my
prayer is, it's done

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.270 align:middle line:10%
and it's already happened.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:10%
It's not, please,
help it happen.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:10%
It's done.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to be OK.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.735 align:middle line:10%
And this is the mindset
that they used in the East

00:28:10.735 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:10%
and when they're doing
healings with people--

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:10%
the Reiki healing, through
different types of healing

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.630 align:middle line:10%
in Tibet, where they actually--

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:17.980 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden was on a video.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:10%
You can look up the video,
actually, on YouTube.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:10%
Gregg Braden is there
with a live scan

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:10%
of a woman with a
bladder cancer ball

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.920 align:middle line:10%
about the size of-- a little
bit bigger than a golf ball.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:10%
And you see it disappear
within about 15 minutes.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:10%
And the doctors, who are not
using any kind of medicine,

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.750 align:middle line:10%
are simply chanting a prayer.

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:10%
Oop-shah.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:10%
Oop-shah.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.040 align:middle line:10%
Oop-shah.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:10%
And what they're saying
is, she's already healed.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:10%
That's the prayer.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.330 align:middle line:10%
The prayer is, she's
already healed.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.080 align:middle line:10%
The prayer is not,
please, heal this woman

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.200 align:middle line:10%
and take away this cancer.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.980 align:middle line:10%
The prayer is, she's healed.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:10%
And within 15 minutes you
see the bladder cancer

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.670 align:middle line:10%
ball just literally disappear
and evaporate right on camera.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:10%
Amazing stuff, OK?

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:10%
So this is using the correct
interface and software

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.480 align:middle line:10%
technology that we're living in.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:10%
We're living in a
software program.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.490 align:middle line:10%
This will give you an idea of
how fractal technology works.

And he's actually on this track
saying a couple of lyrics.

00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:14.280 align:middle line:10%
Listen to the lyrics.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:10%

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Can't blame them.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.260 align:middle line:84%
If we could see influence
made by entities who

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.000 align:middle line:90%
want to see cities in ruins.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You could feel it like Phil
Collins there in the night.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.370 align:middle line:84%

a blazed key with a slice.

the power to a poltergeist.

Yeah, more blessings.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this the essence.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you feel the presence.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.440 align:middle line:90%

That's what I'm going
to answer at the end.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.638 align:middle line:10%
Good question.

00:30:58.638 --> 00:31:00.180 align:middle line:10%
>> Geometry, the
structure of nature,

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.223 align:middle line:10%
is designed on the basis of
what is called fractal geometry.

00:31:04.223 --> 00:31:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And fractal geometry--

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm only going to play
two minutes of this video.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.090 align:middle line:10%
>> --is unique geometry, not
the one we learned at school.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:10%
The geometry we did
learn in school,

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.170 align:middle line:10%
called Euclidean geometry, you
can't model nature with it.

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.180 align:middle line:84%
All those triangles,
cones, cubes,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and spheres are not what
nature really looks like.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.910 align:middle line:84%
But when we were five
years old, in kindergarten,

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:84%
we made a tree, we
made a Euclidean tree.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.800 align:middle line:84%
We had a cylinder for the
trunk and a ball for the top.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.990 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, that's
not nature like.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.230 align:middle line:84%
That geometry is not
the nature geometry.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
We now recognize
this new geometry

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:84%
that really came into our
world in 1983 with the work

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
that Benoit Mandelbrot from
IBM called fractal geometry.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a different
version of geometry.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And it's very exciting.

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But here's the fundamental
key characteristic

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.340 align:middle line:90%
of this geometry.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Built into the nature
of the mathematics

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.510 align:middle line:84%
is a reality that
images of the structure

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:84%
repeat themselves in a
very self-similar fashion

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
at any level of the organization
that you're talking about.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to talk
about cells, or people,

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:08.140 align:middle line:10%
or civilizations, they're all
built on the same geometry.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:10%
But the keyword for most
people to understand

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:10%
is that this geometry links an
ancient mystical understanding.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.630 align:middle line:10%
There was a phrase that people
familiar are with, "as above,

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.110 align:middle line:10%
so below."

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, in this new
geometry, that becomes

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:10%
mathematical and
scientific as a reality.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:28.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Every atom is a mini black
hole that it has infinite

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.530 align:middle line:10%
density, that it has
infinite potential.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.940 align:middle line:10%
That everything has
singularity at its center.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:42.120 align:middle line:10%
The vacuum energy, the structure
of the vacuum itself interlinks

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.090 align:middle line:10%
or entangles all protons.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The proton being the
nuclei of an atom.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:84%
That all the nucleus
of atoms are entangled

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.430 align:middle line:84%
because of the
structure of the vacuum.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:57.810 align:middle line:84%
That the structure, that the
vacuum is not a passive vacuum

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
but an active vacuum
that has a role

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:84%
to play in the creation
of our material world.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
But as well, is the structure
that connects all things.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So actually, this is a
mathematical rendering

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.140 align:middle line:84%
of the concept,
everything is one.

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So that it actually is
mathematically proven.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.640 align:middle line:10%
>> That's why I can study the
nature of a cell and understand

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:27.570 align:middle line:10%
the nature of a human.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.480 align:middle line:10%
Because a human is a
fractal image of a cell.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.010 align:middle line:10%
We're made out of cells.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.960 align:middle line:10%
We're just a large
version of a cell.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.930 align:middle line:10%
And so that a human
body turns out not

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.630 align:middle line:10%
to be a one thing, as
we see it in the mirror,

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.790 align:middle line:10%
but when we really understand,
if you could see it

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.870 align:middle line:10%
with microscopic eyes so you
could see what it looked like,

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:48.540 align:middle line:10%
you'd recognize that a human
body is a community of upwards

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.580 align:middle line:10%
of 50 trillion cells.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:54.292 align:middle line:84%
Every cell is essentially
a miniature human.

00:33:54.292 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Because virtually every
cell has every function

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.670 align:middle line:90%
that I have in my body.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It's already present.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.360 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, any
function that I do with my body

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:10%
is only because a cell
can do that function,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:10%
because I'm made out of cells.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you understand
how deep that is?

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:13.500 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I put my colleagues on
here, Bruce Lipton and Nassim

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:10%
Hariman, because
they're respected, real,

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.860 align:middle line:10%
what I like to call real,
in the field scientists

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.270 align:middle line:10%
and physicists.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:10%
And it's not just me
saying these things up here

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.320 align:middle line:10%
on the stage.

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.364 align:middle line:10%
It's backed up by
real people that

00:34:27.364 --> 00:34:29.489 align:middle line:10%
have done the real research
and have gone out there

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:10%
and really got into
it at another level.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.113 align:middle line:84%
So now, I'm going to go a
little bit into the distant past

00:34:35.113 --> 00:34:36.780 align:middle line:84%
before we come back
to the future again.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk a little
bit about Thoth the Atlantean.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.350 align:middle line:10%
And there's something
called the Emerald tablets,

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:42.659 align:middle line:10%
which is what my
book is based on,

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:10%
the Emerald tablets of Thoth.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.520 align:middle line:10%
This is why I wrote
the book, because it's

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:50.011 align:middle line:10%
so unbelievably amazing what was
talked about 36,000 years ago.

00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:51.719 align:middle line:10%
I want to add a little
bit of credibility

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:55.488 align:middle line:10%
to the Emerald tablets
because a lot of people

00:34:55.488 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:10%
think they may be
a little ambiguous,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:10%
and that they may
have not existed,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.640 align:middle line:10%
or nobody ever knew about them.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.933 align:middle line:10%
And that's actually incorrect.

00:35:02.933 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:10%
The history of the
Emerald tablets

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:10%
is very strong and
well documented.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:10%
The original text was written
in Thoth's Atlantean language.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:10%
The version that I'll be
referencing in this workshop

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.440 align:middle line:10%
is translated by
Michael Doreal and can

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.648 align:middle line:10%
be found on CrystalLinks.com.

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:17.490 align:middle line:10%
A new translation
has been published

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:10%
from the Arabic version
of the Emerald tablets.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.780 align:middle line:10%
And it's a book called,
"The Book of Causes"

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.880 align:middle line:10%
written by the famous
Thomas Aquinas.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm pretty sure people
have heard of this guy.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:10%
A translation by
Sir Isaac Newton,

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.660 align:middle line:10%
you might have
heard of this guy,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.750 align:middle line:10%
was found among his alchemical
papers that are currently

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:10%
housed in the King's
College Library

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:36.600 align:middle line:10%
at Cambridge University.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to
Cambridge University

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and you can actually look at
this with your own eyeballs.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:42.450 align:middle line:90%
OK, it exists.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Philip of Tripoli also
translated the Emerald tablets

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:90%
in 1240 AD.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And also a famous
version he wrote

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:10%
called "The Book of
the Secret of Creation

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:10%
in the Art of Nature"
was written 683 AD.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.805 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about well
documented information

00:35:55.805 --> 00:35:57.840 align:middle line:10%
here when we talk about
the Emerald tablets.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:10%
A famous author
named Roger Bacon

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:10%
was accepted into Oxford
University at the age of 13.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.430 align:middle line:10%
He also translated and wrote a
version of the Emerald tablets.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.700 align:middle line:10%
He was an English
philosopher, Franciscan friar,

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.030 align:middle line:10%
who placed considerable
emphasis on the study of nature

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.220 align:middle line:10%
through empirical methods.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.010 align:middle line:10%
In the early modern era he
was regarded as a wizard,

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and particularly
famed for the story

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.130 align:middle line:10%
of his mechanical, new
chromatic brazen head.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:10%
He was building
robots back then.

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:24.530 align:middle line:90%
This guy is that advanced.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.940 align:middle line:10%
And he's sometimes
credited as one

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:28.770 align:middle line:10%
of the earliest
European advocates

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.650 align:middle line:10%
of the modern scientific
method inspired by Aristotle

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.740 align:middle line:10%
and later by scholars
such as the Arab scientist

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:36.810 align:middle line:10%
named Al-Hasan.

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking
about something that

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.780 align:middle line:10%
is real, solid, and has been
touched by many, many very

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:44.040 align:middle line:10%
studious people.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.690 align:middle line:90%
36,000 year old texts.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:47.490 align:middle line:84%
This is why this
text is so important.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:51.520 align:middle line:10%
Because it predates everything
by so many tens of thousands

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.320 align:middle line:10%
of years.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.945 align:middle line:10%
We're talking two
processional periods.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:56.487 align:middle line:10%
So if you're talking about the
star movements across the sky,

00:36:56.487 --> 00:36:57.870 align:middle line:10%
two processional periods back.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:10%
This is when the
Sphinx was built.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:04.470 align:middle line:10%
Thoth himself starts off
in the Emerald tablets,

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.810 align:middle line:10%
"I builded the Great
Pyramid, patterned

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:10%
after the pyramid of Earth's
force burning eternally,

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.820 align:middle line:10%
so that it, too, might
remain through the ages."

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:90%
Thoth built the pyramid.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.267 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, his dad ordered
him to build the Sphinx.

00:37:15.267 --> 00:37:17.100 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at
the weathering patterns

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.260 align:middle line:10%
on the Sphinx, now
archeologists and geologists

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.880 align:middle line:10%
are starting to discover
that, forget 5,000 years,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:10%
forget 10,000, forget 13,000.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's looking and
pointing towards two

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:10%
new processional
periods back in time

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.880 align:middle line:10%
to point towards a
constellation of Leo.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And that takes us back
to 36,000 years ago,

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.960 align:middle line:84%
at the exact time when the
Emerald tablets were written.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.730 align:middle line:10%
So again, as more validation
to this information.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:43.530 align:middle line:10%
So who was Thoth?

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.110 align:middle line:10%
He is also known as
Hermes Trismegistus,

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.460 align:middle line:10%
or some of the modern
day fashion Hermes.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.520 align:middle line:10%
As I was told recently.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Somebody is--

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.490 align:middle line:10%
reminds me of Jesus
going into the temple

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.340 align:middle line:10%
and knocking over the
change, the guys who

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:10%
were selling and gambling at
the temple and everything.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:10%
If you read that
part of the Bible.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.940 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of taken
Thoth again here,

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:10%
because I really believe
there's a connection there,

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.830 align:middle line:10%
and turned him into
a fashion statement.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, Thoth, master
of all arts and scientists.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.530 align:middle line:90%
Perfect in all crafts.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Ruler of the three worlds.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Scribe of the gods and
keeper of the book of life.

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about what
the book of life actually is,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.358 align:middle line:90%
Thoth, Hermes Trismegistus.

00:38:30.358 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Three times the greatest
is what it really means.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.808 align:middle line:90%
He was the first intelligencer.

00:38:33.808 --> 00:38:35.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, he was
one of the smartest people

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to ever walk on this
planet, probably

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.570 align:middle line:90%
even in our solar system.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.760 align:middle line:84%
He was regarded by the
ancient Egyptians, which

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
is really the land of Kem long
before the term Egyptian even

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:45.160 align:middle line:90%
existed.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.100 align:middle line:84%
He was regarded
as the embodiment

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.730 align:middle line:84%
of the universal mind,
while in all probability,

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:84%
there actually existed a great
sage and educator by the name

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.220 align:middle line:90%
of Hermes or Hermes.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to extricate
that the historical man

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.100 align:middle line:84%
from the mass of
legendary accounts which

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:84%
an attempt to identify him
with the cosmic principle

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.290 align:middle line:90%
of thought.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.830 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about Thoth
the Atlantean priest King

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.740 align:middle line:10%
from the land of Kem,
36,000 years ago,

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.805 align:middle line:10%
when he wrote this in his own
hand, the Emerald tablets.

00:39:14.805 --> 00:39:16.180 align:middle line:10%
He didn't have a
scribe write it.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:10%
He wrote it himself.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.322 align:middle line:10%
He talks about everything
that we're talking about now

00:39:20.322 --> 00:39:21.280 align:middle line:10%
in the Emerald tablets.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.980 align:middle line:10%
That we're living in a
holographic dream world.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.590 align:middle line:10%
And that you can travel through
this holographic dreamworld

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.380 align:middle line:10%
by transcending
the physical body,

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.780 align:middle line:10%
and having astral projections,
and using your mind

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.160 align:middle line:10%
to travel through the universe.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.760 align:middle line:10%
And in the book, he talks
about going through portals,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:10%
using his mind, and actually
getting out and visiting

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.345 align:middle line:10%
other civilizations, and
watching them rise and fall.

00:39:43.345 --> 00:39:45.970 align:middle line:10%
You know how long it takes for
a civilization to rise and fall?

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.890 align:middle line:10%
We're talking tens of
thousands of years.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:10%
He also had the
capability in the book,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:10%
which is why it's so amazing,
to create avatar bodies.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
humanoid bodies, just

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
like in the movie "Avatar,"
and transfer his consciousness

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.480 align:middle line:90%
into a new body.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.772 align:middle line:10%
And then, when that body
was starting to wear out,

00:40:03.772 --> 00:40:05.230 align:middle line:10%
he would put that
body in something

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:07.390 align:middle line:10%
called the Halls of Amenti
inside of a rejuvenation

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.290 align:middle line:10%
chamber.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.020 align:middle line:10%
And while that body was
rejuvenating for 100 years,

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.600 align:middle line:10%
he would walk amongst
men in another body.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.850 align:middle line:10%
And he would transfer his
consciousness back and forth

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.017 align:middle line:10%
into these different bodies.

00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And according to him in
these Emerald tablets,

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.410 align:middle line:10%
he did it 100 times 100.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:10%
That's 100,000 years
that this being

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.860 align:middle line:10%
has been walking,
according to him,

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.720 align:middle line:10%
around this universe in
multiple different bodies

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:10%
by transferring consciousness.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.830 align:middle line:10%
And that sounds like, wow.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.580 align:middle line:10%
That sounds, this
is just outrageous.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:90%
But not really.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.600 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, if
you research the Avatar

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.465 align:middle line:84%
project by DARPA, the
United States military.

00:40:40.465 --> 00:40:41.590 align:middle line:90%
This is public information.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.965 align:middle line:84%
You can Google it
and look it up.

00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:45.040 align:middle line:90%
D-A-R-P-A, Avatar project.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.440 align:middle line:10%
They now have a
symbiotic relationship

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.740 align:middle line:10%
between a soldier and
an actual field robot

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.780 align:middle line:10%
where they transfer the
soldier's consciousness

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.010 align:middle line:10%
into a field robot
and operate it.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.180 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:10%
There's another project
called the 2045 project.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.030 align:middle line:10%
You can go to
2045.com, 2-0-4-5.com.

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:05.980 align:middle line:10%
Ray Kurzweil out of Russia
has now started and funded

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.500 align:middle line:10%
this project over a decade ago.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.090 align:middle line:10%
The first round was
already completed,

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.700 align:middle line:10%
transfer a monkey's
consciousness into a computer.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.630 align:middle line:10%
This monkey thinks it is alive.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.090 align:middle line:10%
It's eating bananas and
climbing trees in a computer.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.410 align:middle line:84%
But the body, the
physical body, is gone.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.670 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness
has been transferred.

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:10%
By 2010, they were hoping
to transfer consciousness

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:10%
from a human being into a robot.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, they claim that
they haven't done it yet.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:33.490 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.554 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.790 align:middle line:90%
"Transcendence."

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Very, very similar.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:40.628 align:middle line:90%
That was a great movie.

00:41:40.628 --> 00:41:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I just saw that movie, actually,
maybe six or seven months ago.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:44.285 align:middle line:90%
Great movie.

00:41:44.285 --> 00:41:46.660 align:middle line:84%
She's talking about a movie
called "Transcendence," where

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.327 align:middle line:84%
Johnny Depp was in,
where he transferred

00:41:48.327 --> 00:41:51.520 align:middle line:84%
his consciousness out of
his body into the internet.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.830 align:middle line:84%
This is all real
science, real technology.

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:54.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not something.

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.130 align:middle line:10%
So I'm trying to show you,
when you look at 36,000 year

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:10%
old texts, this guy says he's
transferring his consciousness.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.540 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm bringing
you to 2019,

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:04.600 align:middle line:10%
and I'm telling you that we're
now transferring consciousness.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.450 align:middle line:10%
It's real.

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:06.250 align:middle line:10%
It's real.

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not hypothetical.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.980 align:middle line:10%
This is real science and
real stuff that's going on.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.530 align:middle line:10%
This is a slide image from
my friend, Gerald Clark.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.590 align:middle line:10%
He's an author of "The
Anunnaki of Nibiru"

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:21.467 align:middle line:10%
and also, "The 7th
Planet, Mercury Rising."

00:42:21.467 --> 00:42:23.550 align:middle line:10%
He allowed me to use this
slide, also, in my book.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you a lot, Gerald.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.620 align:middle line:84%
This book goes
over the dimensions

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth talks about
in the Emerald tablets.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It's talking about the 14
lower dimensions, which

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.220 align:middle line:84%
he goes into in
great depth, as well

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.220 align:middle line:84%
as the fact that we're living
in a holographic universe.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And that there's this
human energy called

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.300 align:middle line:84%
the Ba, which as you
know, in the Mer-Ka-Ba,

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.310 align:middle line:90%
the Ba is the human energy.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.750 align:middle line:84%
That is basically locked
through this Ubi, to the Earth.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then also, we're
talking about level

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.620 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, and 3 where the
reincarnation process takes

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.420 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Because according
to Thoth, there's

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:84%
a technology that
has been utilized,

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.188 align:middle line:84%
an energetic technology
to re-encapsulate human

00:43:04.188 --> 00:43:05.730 align:middle line:84%
consciousness back
into reincarnating

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.420 align:middle line:84%
bodies for the purpose of
using human beings as slaves

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.100 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what Thoth talks
about in 36,000-year-old texts.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.280 align:middle line:90%
This is amazing stuff.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.780 align:middle line:84%
He also talks about
the portal guard

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.250 align:middle line:84%
to Osiris, the 12th House
illusion of the Duat,

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.650 align:middle line:84%
the portal guards where,
if you want to really

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.410 align:middle line:84%
try to ascend past, if
you see the one there

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.320 align:middle line:84%
with the red,
where it says stop.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:31.050 align:middle line:84%
If you want to try to
send past the dimensions

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.450 align:middle line:84%
to transcend space
time, you have

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to get your mind and
your consciousness

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.580 align:middle line:90%
to a certain level.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.730 align:middle line:84%
You have to reach a
certain level of mastery

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.580 align:middle line:84%
over consciousness to be
able to ascend and get

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:47.580 align:middle line:90%
past the portal guard of Osiris.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, once
you pass that, you

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.130 align:middle line:84%
can travel down the
dimensions 1 through 9.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's an amazing
revelation that Thoth

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.640 align:middle line:84%
talks about in ancient
times which correlates now

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:90%
to more modern science.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.400 align:middle line:84%
When you look at
Michio Kaku talking

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.950 align:middle line:84%
about the dimensions
of our universe,

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and how there's a set number
of dimensions or the universe

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.420 align:middle line:90%
will collapse on itself.

00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're talking about
ancient information correlating

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:14.830 align:middle line:90%
to modern times.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:18.065 align:middle line:84%
And I go in depth
into this in the book.

00:44:18.065 --> 00:44:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you really want to
learn a lot more about it,

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.660 align:middle line:90%
you've got to get the book.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:23.739 align:middle line:90%
Shameless plug.

00:44:23.739 --> 00:44:26.520 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
realize that the pyramids

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:32.580 align:middle line:90%
are built on a fractal pattern.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.540 align:middle line:10%
The pyramids on Earth.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.520 align:middle line:10%
All pyramids are built
on fractal patterns.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Triangles within triangles,
polygons within polygons,

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.480 align:middle line:10%
basically.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.880 align:middle line:10%
And this technology is the
same architectural technology

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.482 align:middle line:10%
used to build pyramids all over
the world, not only on Earth,

00:44:44.482 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:10%
but also you could
find them on the Moon.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.460 align:middle line:10%
And when you go into
more of the space data,

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.110 align:middle line:10%
you find them on Mars,
you find them on Titan.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.210 align:middle line:10%
You find them throughout
the entire solar system,

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.370 align:middle line:10%
you find these pyramids.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, anybody here ever
been to Teotihuacan, Mexico?

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.450 align:middle line:84%
You hear the guide or
the archeologist talk

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.370 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that
the pyramids are

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.107 align:middle line:90%
pyramids on top of pyramids.

00:45:04.107 --> 00:45:05.940 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid of Moon is
not just one pyramid.

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.898 align:middle line:84%
The Pyramid of the Sun
is not just one pyramid.

00:45:07.898 --> 00:45:10.718 align:middle line:10%
There's pyramids built on top
of pyramids, on top of pyramids,

00:45:10.718 --> 00:45:12.510 align:middle line:10%
on top of pyramids, to
create the structure

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:10%
that you see at the top--

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:10%
the outside skin, so to
speak, of the pyramid.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.038 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple pyramids
stacked on top of each other.

00:45:19.038 --> 00:45:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And no matter where
you go, you start

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to discover that all pyramids
are built in this same fashion.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And so, again,
adding credibility

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to the technology
of the distant past.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.620 align:middle line:84%
All around the
planet, you discover

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.780 align:middle line:84%
this archeological
feat that they

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.450 align:middle line:84%
were able to do using
this fractal technology

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.500 align:middle line:90%
in this fractal design.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew how
the universe worked.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
understand "as above, so below,"

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and replicate and
duplicate that into pyramid

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.440 align:middle line:84%
technology, pyramids that were
multi-functional computers.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And they all had
different specific uses.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.135 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's a
Bent Pyramid in Egypt.

00:45:55.135 --> 00:45:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Bent Pyramid
in Egypt, they'll

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.920 align:middle line:10%
tell you on TV that it
was bent at that angle

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.220 align:middle line:10%
because, as they got
to a certain angle,

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:03.187 align:middle line:10%
they made a mistake.

00:46:03.187 --> 00:46:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And then they realized, in
order to let it not collapse,

00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.880 align:middle line:84%
they had to take it to a sharper
angle, and all this crazy crap.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Fake.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Fake, OK?

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.980 align:middle line:10%
The homegrown
Egyptologist, guy who

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:16.783 align:middle line:10%
used to, as a kid, run
through the tunnels

00:46:16.783 --> 00:46:18.700 align:middle line:10%
underneath the pyramid
and play in the tunnels

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:10%
under it as a kid,
that's the type of people

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.590 align:middle line:10%
that I like to deal with, has
been inside the Bent Pyramid

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:25.390 align:middle line:10%
many times.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:84%
There's a multiple chamber
inside that pyramid.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.650 align:middle line:90%
One fills with water.

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:10%
And there's an upper
level where the actual--

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.800 align:middle line:10%
they call him like a doctor, but
I forgot the exact terminology.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.610 align:middle line:10%
He called this doctor.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.660 align:middle line:10%
It's not really a
doctor, but something

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.320 align:middle line:10%
like a physician
in ancient times

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.650 align:middle line:10%
would go to this upper
area looking down.

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.720 align:middle line:10%
And in the second chamber
that didn't have water,

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.340 align:middle line:10%
they would put a human body.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:47.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the area where
they had the water,

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:51.280 align:middle line:10%
they would have this
resonating sound like cymatics.

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:52.160 align:middle line:10%
See?

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.560 align:middle line:10%
So the cymatics, right
on cue, would then

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.900 align:middle line:10%
create a frequency in
the second chamber.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.590 align:middle line:10%
And it would actually not
only illuminate the body.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.460 align:middle line:10%
See, it's working now.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.104 align:middle line:10%
And can you see my skeleton?

00:47:05.104 --> 00:47:06.760 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.580 align:middle line:10%
So it would illuminate the body.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:14.140 align:middle line:10%
And it would then make
a holographic X-ray

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.543 align:middle line:10%
of the human being.

00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:17.710 align:middle line:10%
Then the physician looking
down from the upper level

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.918 align:middle line:10%
would be able to tell what
was wrong with the person.

00:47:19.918 --> 00:47:22.030 align:middle line:10%
That's what the Bent Pyramid is.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:23.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what the Bent Pyramid is.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It's an actual hospital.

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:26.270 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.030 align:middle line:10%
It's lab equipment.

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:32.350 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of the pyramids
around the world

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.030 align:middle line:10%
have very, very
different features.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:35.500 align:middle line:10%
If you go to
Teotihuacan, Mexico,

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.810 align:middle line:10%
you discover that when
you look down from above,

00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.600 align:middle line:10%
it looks like a
computer circuit board.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.190 align:middle line:10%
And when you look
at the tunnels that

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.403 align:middle line:10%
connect the pyramids
at Teotihuacan,

00:47:44.403 --> 00:47:45.820 align:middle line:10%
you realize that
there's mica that

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.860 align:middle line:10%
came from hundreds
of miles away lined

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.270 align:middle line:10%
on the inside of those tunnels.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:10%
Mica is an electric insulator.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.530 align:middle line:10%
What is electric
insulation doing inside

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:10%
of connecting tunnels
on a plateau that's

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.530 align:middle line:10%
shaped like a computer circuit?

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:00.350 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.142 align:middle line:10%
You've got to ask
yourself these questions.

00:48:02.142 --> 00:48:05.590 align:middle line:10%
So we're talking about some
very, very advanced people

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.840 align:middle line:10%
that really understood
a lot of things.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.230 align:middle line:10%
When you look at this grid
map of the Earth, all of these

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:15.440 align:middle line:10%
are power nodes on the planet.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:17.800 align:middle line:10%
And when you look at these
power nodes, amazingly,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.130 align:middle line:10%
what begins to happen, these
are scientifically proven power

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:10%
nodes on the planet where
there's more magnetic energy

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.528 align:middle line:10%
than others.

00:48:24.528 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:10%
Everywhere you look at
one of those points,

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:31.510 align:middle line:10%
there's a megalithic structure
or a gravitational anomaly

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.808 align:middle line:10%
on this planet.

00:48:32.808 --> 00:48:34.600 align:middle line:10%
And then, when you look
at the grid itself,

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.230 align:middle line:10%
you realize that the
greatest fractal.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:10%
It's a fractal grid
wrapped around this planet,

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.600 align:middle line:10%
based on magnetic
energies and frequencies.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:46.187 align:middle line:10%
And then as you travel it,
if there's a landmass there,

00:48:46.187 --> 00:48:47.770 align:middle line:10%
or if even some of
them are submerged,

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:53.035 align:middle line:10%
you discover things like
Dwarka, and Baalbek, and Giza,

00:48:53.035 --> 00:48:54.160 align:middle line:10%
and all these other places.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.410 align:middle line:10%
You start to begin to
discover that there's

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.630 align:middle line:10%
these ancient people built
megalithic structures

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.822 align:middle line:10%
on these nodes.

00:48:59.822 --> 00:49:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Why would they do that?

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:05.580 align:middle line:10%
And how did they know
that it even existed?

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.620 align:middle line:10%
Sylvester James
S. Gates, Jr. He's

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.840 align:middle line:10%
an American theoretical
physicist who

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.580 align:middle line:10%
works on super-symmetry,
super-gravity, and super-string

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.380 align:middle line:10%
theory.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.820 align:middle line:10%
He retired from the
Physics department

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.903 align:middle line:10%
at the University of
Maryland College of Computer,

00:49:16.903 --> 00:49:20.430 align:middle line:10%
and Mathematical, and
Natural Sciences in 2017.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.080 align:middle line:10%
He's now the Ford
Foundation Professor

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.240 align:middle line:10%
of Physics at Brown University.

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.940 align:middle line:10%
He was a University of
Maryland Regents Professor

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.220 align:middle line:10%
and served on former president
Barack Obama's Council

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.560 align:middle line:10%
of Advisors on Science
and Technology.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:10%
I think he has a
little bit of a resume.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.630 align:middle line:10%
I think this guy might
know a couple of things.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.160 align:middle line:10%
That's all I'm saying.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Well, he discovered something
called adinkra codes

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:44.520 align:middle line:10%
in the space time of the
ether that we're manifesting

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.040 align:middle line:10%
and that we're living in
right now consciously.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.540 align:middle line:10%
Something called adinkra codes.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.910 align:middle line:10%
Now, when I heard that the
first time, my jaw dropped.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:54.060 align:middle line:10%
Because I was researching
adinkras from the Dogon tribe

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:54.900 align:middle line:10%
in Mali, Africa.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.317 align:middle line:10%
Because I was
researching the fact

00:49:56.317 --> 00:49:59.280 align:middle line:10%
that the Dogon tribe in Africa
had known about the Sirius

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:00.360 align:middle line:10%
star system.

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:02.623 align:middle line:10%
They had known about
Sirius A, B, and C

00:50:02.623 --> 00:50:05.040 align:middle line:10%
long before modern science he
became close to knowing they

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.840 align:middle line:10%
existed.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:10%
Not only that, the Dogon
tribe out of Mali, Africa

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.040 align:middle line:10%
knew all about every planet
in our entire solar system,

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:14.310 align:middle line:10%
the size, shape, and colors
of the planets, as well.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.300 align:middle line:10%
They knew it.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.383 align:middle line:10%
They even knew that Uranus
was laying on its side.

00:50:17.383 --> 00:50:20.330 align:middle line:10%
How in the world could
they know this information?

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.870 align:middle line:10%
The Dogon tribe out
there in Africa.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.810 align:middle line:10%
They're originally from where?

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Ancient Egypt, the land of Kem.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.340 align:middle line:10%
They migrated out
of the land of Kem

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.930 align:middle line:10%
at some point in
the distant past

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:34.350 align:middle line:10%
and moved into this
area called Mali.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:36.418 align:middle line:10%
But they kept all of
the ancient traditions

00:50:36.418 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:10%
and all that ancient knowledge.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:41.790 align:middle line:10%
And they said that the Nommos
came from Sirius B, which

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.385 align:middle line:10%
are these Anunnaki creatures,
the sky gods of old,

00:50:46.385 --> 00:50:47.760 align:middle line:10%
and taught them
this information.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.060 align:middle line:10%
And they have passed this
information down for thousands,

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.580 align:middle line:10%
and thousands, and thousands
of years, generation

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.250 align:middle line:10%
to generation,
through the leaders

00:50:56.250 --> 00:51:00.130 align:middle line:10%
of the group, or the clan, or
tribe, if you want to call it.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.945 align:middle line:90%
Now these adinkra codes--

00:51:01.945 --> 00:51:02.820 align:middle line:90%
here are their codes.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.320 align:middle line:84%
You can see their
code, and then you

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.630 align:middle line:84%
see the scientific discovery,
or I should say, rediscovery.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:12.240 align:middle line:84%
All of these geometric
symbols can be also replicated

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.990 align:middle line:84%
in modern day times
now at the bottom

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.495 align:middle line:84%
in new mathematic geometrical
codes called adinkras.

00:51:18.495 --> 00:51:22.455 align:middle line:84%
And these adinkra codes are what
govern our space time reality

00:51:22.455 --> 00:51:24.760 align:middle line:84%
that we operate and navigate
in the third dimension

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in these flesh machines
that we have right here.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:27.840 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.625 align:middle line:84%
They give us the
illusory of matter.

00:51:30.625 --> 00:51:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And they are, literally,
you're looking

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:36.090 align:middle line:84%
at the actual programming
of the matrix.

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:37.920 align:middle line:84%
You're witnessing the
matrix programming.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if you ever wondered
what the matrix looks like,

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.520 align:middle line:84%
what the program
code looks like,

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.760 align:middle line:84%
this is the program
code for the matrix.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.820 align:middle line:84%
As above, so below,
on every level.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:49.350 align:middle line:10%
The same software
program that we're

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:53.202 align:middle line:10%
using to create this
presentation right here

00:51:53.202 --> 00:51:54.660 align:middle line:10%
are the same software
programs that

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.952 align:middle line:10%
are operating and creating
the matrix system that we're

00:51:56.952 --> 00:52:00.150 align:middle line:10%
living, and operating, and
maneuvering through right now.

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:01.320 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.980 align:middle line:84%
It's because you have
to understand the source

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.040 align:middle line:84%
energy that created
this entire realm is

00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:10.300 align:middle line:84%
flowing in us, through
us, and out of us.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.600 align:middle line:90%
It is us and we are it.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.730 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing
as, I had an idea.

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:17.460 align:middle line:10%
There is no such thing
as, I invented something.

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.230 align:middle line:10%
The information is
transmitted to you,

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.700 align:middle line:10%
and if you're on the right
frequency, you receive it.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you have enough
intuition, you decipher it.

00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you have enough
ambition, then you

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.213 align:middle line:84%
will put it out there
as an invention,

00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:30.630 align:middle line:84%
or as information,
or as knowledge

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.820 align:middle line:90%
that you teach to somebody.

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:35.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I'm saying up
here, I don't know any of it.

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:38.568 align:middle line:84%
It all came to me through
what they call a download.

00:52:38.568 --> 00:52:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And so when you hear
people say, all right,

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.220 align:middle line:90%
download information.

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:43.428 align:middle line:84%
And some people are going,
man, this person is crazy.

00:52:43.428 --> 00:52:45.360 align:middle line:90%
They're downloading information.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.800 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand something.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.650 align:middle line:84%
The human body is a
two way Wi-Fi source.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:55.020 align:middle line:84%
DNA, human DNA,
scientists took DNA out

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.570 align:middle line:84%
of a person, a human
being, one gram.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:52:59.880 align:middle line:84%
Enough to put on the
tip of your finger.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.310 align:middle line:84%
They then connected it
to a microchip processor

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in a hard drive and uploaded
and downloaded zeros and ones

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.360 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Said, wow.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.960 align:middle line:84%
This DNA stores digital
information like a computer.

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:84%
They then uploaded the
entire book onto it,

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.923 align:middle line:84%
and downloaded the
entire book onto it.

00:53:14.923 --> 00:53:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Then they uploaded the entire
Library of Congress onto it,

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and downloaded the entire
Library of Congress on it.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.722 align:middle line:90%
They said, wait a minute.

00:53:20.722 --> 00:53:23.010 align:middle line:84%
What's the storage capacity
on this one gram of DNA?

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:28.750 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that 1 gram of DNA
can store 700 terabytes of data.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
Which means that every
single one of you in here

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.830 align:middle line:84%
has enough DNA in your body
to store all the information.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:84%
One person in here, one human
being, one person, one body,

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:middle line:84%
all the information
from the beginning

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of the creation of this
universe till this very second.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:46.290 align:middle line:10%
All that knowledge, information,
and data is inside of your body

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:48.270 align:middle line:10%
right now.

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.580 align:middle line:10%
That's how powerful it is.

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:10%
So when you start to
look into this stuff,

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:10%
and you go, wow, what in
the world is going on here?

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.730 align:middle line:90%
Fractal holographic universe.

00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.290 align:middle line:84%
We're living in
a program matrix.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies operate
like software.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.180 align:middle line:10%
You start to really
understand that we possibly

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.730 align:middle line:10%
are living in a civilization
created by an ancestor

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:08.102 align:middle line:10%
civilization above
us, whether it's

00:54:08.102 --> 00:54:10.560 align:middle line:10%
a divinity or divine creator,
whether you believe it's God,

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.888 align:middle line:10%
or whatever you believe,
it's a creation.

00:54:12.888 --> 00:54:14.430 align:middle line:10%
But I'm showing you
the method that's

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.770 align:middle line:10%
being used to
operate this matrix,

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:20.010 align:middle line:10%
and operate and program it to
where we navigate through it.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at creation
according to Hermes.

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.360 align:middle line:10%
"In the beginning,
Nous, also known as God,

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.820 align:middle line:10%
created a second Nous,
who became a craftsman

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.060 align:middle line:10%
and created the world.

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:30.688 align:middle line:10%
Nous II creates seven
powers in the seven spheres

00:54:30.688 --> 00:54:31.980 align:middle line:10%
around what would become Earth.

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The spheres have control
over what will be on Earth."

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We're talking again
about control,

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:39.600 align:middle line:84%
and controlling frequencies,
their control, how we think,

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:42.150 align:middle line:84%
operate, and navigate as
human beings on this planet.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.460 align:middle line:84%
There's these
levels to the game.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Levels to the game.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And anybody here ever seen
"Jupiter Ascending," the movie?

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:51.600 align:middle line:84%
If you've seen that movie,
you understand that there's

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.160 align:middle line:90%
levels to the game.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.470 align:middle line:84%
There's people out
there that just go

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.252 align:middle line:90%
to work and punch a time clock.

00:54:57.252 --> 00:54:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's always people
out there that own planets.

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:01.668 align:middle line:84%
Then there's people out
there that own solar systems.

00:55:01.668 --> 00:55:04.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's people out
there that own galaxies.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.880 align:middle line:90%
This is real.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.220 align:middle line:90%
Real, real, real.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.830 align:middle line:84%
There's people out
there that are running

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:84%
this region of space itself,
this particular section

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.780 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.840 align:middle line:84%
There's people that run this
place, that own this place, way

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.330 align:middle line:84%
above us on another
level, on another level,

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:22.770 align:middle line:90%
totally another level.

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.510 align:middle line:84%
They control what
we know as destiny.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.067 align:middle line:84%
The seven spheres are the
moon, the Sun, Mercury, Venus,

00:55:27.067 --> 00:55:27.900 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.882 align:middle line:84%
Those are archetypes,
basically, what those are.

00:55:31.882 --> 00:55:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Here is the beginning
of astrology.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:35.010 align:middle line:10%
Nous, two sets of
spheres in motion,

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:35.820 align:middle line:10%
and life begins on Earth.

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.862 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to get a
demonstration from Hermes

00:55:37.862 --> 00:55:41.870 align:middle line:10%
36,000 years ago, maybe
even further back than that,

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:44.680 align:middle line:10%
as to how life creates.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.458 align:middle line:84%
Now, he talks about something
called the seven principles.

00:55:47.458 --> 00:55:48.750 align:middle line:90%
And these are seven principles.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
go over them today.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go over
these on Monday.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.773 align:middle line:90%
This is why I put this slide up.

00:55:52.773 --> 00:55:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Monday, I have a
post-conference lecture

00:55:54.560 --> 00:56:02.595 align:middle line:84%
at 8:00 PM, 8:00 PM to
10:30 PM, here somewhere.

00:56:02.595 --> 00:56:04.377 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look
it up on the book.

00:56:04.377 --> 00:56:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'll be talking about the
seven hermetic principles.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be going in depth into
these seven hermetic principles

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.610 align:middle line:84%
on Monday at the
post-conference show.

00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.500 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to learn a
little bit more about that,

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.230 align:middle line:84%
please come to the
post-conference show.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to really go deep
into these hermetic principles

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysics, and how they
apply to our everyday lives.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.765 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
the correlation

00:56:22.765 --> 00:56:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to take all the mysticism out of
it, and make you understand it,

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:30.153 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to actually
apply it to your everyday life.

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The second principle that we've
been talking about all day

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.030 align:middle line:84%
long so far has
been, guess what?

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:36.830 align:middle line:90%
The principle of correspondence.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:38.643 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:56:38.643 --> 00:56:40.310 align:middle line:84%
That's literally what
we've been talking

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.197 align:middle line:84%
about in this fractal
holographic matrix.

00:56:42.197 --> 00:56:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything you can see
at the smallest scale

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.650 align:middle line:84%
operates at the
larger scale, period.

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Just like Bill
Lipton said, he said

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.762 align:middle line:84%
that, I don't need to look at
a cell, because I am a cell.

00:56:52.762 --> 00:56:55.220 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a cell, the cell
can do everything I can do,

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.803 align:middle line:84%
and I can do everything
a cell can do.

00:56:56.803 --> 00:56:59.137 align:middle line:84%
You can just keep expounding
on that and get to as large

00:56:59.137 --> 00:56:59.990 align:middle line:90%
as you can get.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
we're living inside

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:04.520 align:middle line:84%
of something that is not
only holographic by nature

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.270 align:middle line:84%
but the fundamental basis of
it, it's a living organism,

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:09.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:10.820 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of hard to
put the two together.

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:11.700 align:middle line:90%
But we're living.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.390 align:middle line:84%
If you take and create
a robot and inject

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:16.550 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
into it, you literally

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:19.130 align:middle line:84%
have a robot that you
created that's alive.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:20.180 align:middle line:90%
It may even be sentient.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
method, same technique.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Take saying that it's
holographic by nature

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:28.310 align:middle line:10%
doesn't take away the fact it
is sentient and that it's alive.

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:30.770 align:middle line:10%
So you have to really be able
to merge the two together

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:32.330 align:middle line:10%
in your mind.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.450 align:middle line:10%
The amazing thing about the seed
of life, which is right here,

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.200 align:middle line:10%
it starts off as
these six circles

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.800 align:middle line:10%
surrounded by the seventh.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And it literally is
the fundamental basis

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:84%
of the start of most life
in the universe, I believe.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, on Earth, for
sure, it's there.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.060 align:middle line:10%
In the base of your spine
are these same seven cells

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:53.900 align:middle line:10%
and they remain there
for your entire life.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.600 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the cross
section cut of DNA,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.720 align:middle line:10%
you're going to see, on
an electron microscope,

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.210 align:middle line:10%
you're going to see
the seed of life.

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:05.590 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:06.530 align:middle line:10%
It's everywhere.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.650 align:middle line:10%
It's everywhere.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:08.450 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.925 align:middle line:10%
You can't escape it.

00:58:09.925 --> 00:58:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And the beautiful thing
about the seed of life

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.180 align:middle line:10%
is that, look here,
through mitosis,

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.670 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at,
on the left side,

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:22.780 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at the
geometric pattern.

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing how it
relates to biological life going

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:28.660 align:middle line:84%
towards the right as we
move through the biological

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:32.200 align:middle line:84%
processes to create more
sophisticated, more complex

00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.140 align:middle line:84%
cell division, getting
into a very complicated

00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.940 align:middle line:84%
what we call a
biological organism.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you're looking here on
the left side, as you scroll,

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:42.102 align:middle line:84%
as you go down these circles
and you get to the bottom,

00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:84%
you end up at the
flower of life.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:48.688 align:middle line:84%
When anybody here ever wish
they could see the face of God?

00:58:48.688 --> 00:58:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, you look at
the flower of life.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the face of God.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what I have on
my neck right here.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.310 align:middle line:10%
This is the face of God.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.185 align:middle line:10%
You're looking at the
face of God right here.

00:58:55.185 --> 00:58:56.870 align:middle line:10%
God is not a man.

00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:59.370 align:middle line:90%
God is not a man.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:03.960 align:middle line:84%
There is no man that's running,
that's creating universes out

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.510 align:middle line:84%
there called God, in
my personal opinion.

00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.570 align:middle line:10%
I hope that doesn't offend
anybody, but God is not a man.

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:13.130 align:middle line:84%
God is a spiritual
divine energy.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And that divine
energy has a shape.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.570 align:middle line:10%
And the shape of that divine
energy is the flower of life.

00:59:18.570 --> 00:59:22.140 align:middle line:10%
The frequencies that emanate
from between these patterns

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.260 align:middle line:10%
literally jingles
matter into existence,

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:28.080 align:middle line:10%
and jingles energetic
particles into existence

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.080 align:middle line:10%
on a consistent basis.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And it never stops.

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.172 align:middle line:84%
And that is flowing in you,
through you, and out of you

00:59:32.172 --> 00:59:34.320 align:middle line:84%
at this very, very
moment right now.

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.410 align:middle line:84%
What Nikola Tesla rediscovered
that the ancient Egyptians

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:40.720 align:middle line:84%
already knew was that you can
tap into this zero point energy

00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.520 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.562 align:middle line:10%
Because inside of the
flower of life is something

00:59:43.562 --> 00:59:45.470 align:middle line:10%
called a 64-grid tetrahedron.

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that 64-grid tetrahedron
is something called a vector

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:49.200 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And in the vector
equilibrium, science

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:53.160 align:middle line:84%
found out that there
is an unlimited source

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.700 align:middle line:84%
of energy emanating from that
flower of life right now.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.038 align:middle line:90%
Unlimited.

00:59:58.038 --> 00:59:59.580 align:middle line:84%
All these lights
and everything else,

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.110 align:middle line:84%
it's powering this
entire planet.

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:01.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't need fuel.

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.540 align:middle line:90%
We don't need gas.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:06.630 align:middle line:10%
We don't need electric cars
and all this kind of stuff.

01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:09.523 align:middle line:10%
We should literally be able
to just tap into it as we go.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:11.190 align:middle line:10%
You should just turn
your cell phone on,

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.170 align:middle line:10%
and it will just literally
suck in the energy right

01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.003 align:middle line:10%
from the ether of space
time, right into it,

01:00:15.003 --> 01:00:16.140 align:middle line:10%
and charge itself up.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.973 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't even be
any to plug your cell

01:00:17.973 --> 01:00:19.710 align:middle line:90%
phone into a wall.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:21.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's another timeline.

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.890 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, that we--

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:26.670 align:middle line:90%
--we forfeited.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the Nikola Tesla
timeline, obviously.

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:31.320 align:middle line:10%
You know, a lot of
these ancient techniques

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.800 align:middle line:10%
and scientific discoveries have
been oppressed and suppressed

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:38.287 align:middle line:10%
from the general population
for many eons, many, many eons.

01:00:38.287 --> 01:00:39.870 align:middle line:10%
Because the people
that are in control

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:42.360 align:middle line:10%
and power on this planet
don't want this information

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.420 align:middle line:10%
to get out.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.660 align:middle line:84%
They want people to
stay dumbed down.

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.743 align:middle line:84%
If a few thousand people
learn about it this year,

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:47.770 align:middle line:90%
they're happy.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But if seven billion people
learn this, it's game over.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Game over.

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Religious systems collapse.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Multi-trillion dollar industry,
governmental systems collapse.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.210 align:middle line:84%
All these major
corporations that

01:01:00.210 --> 01:01:01.695 align:middle line:84%
siphon money out
of your pockets,

01:01:01.695 --> 01:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
and take money
out of your mouths

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:05.403 align:middle line:84%
that you can be using to do
other things with your life,

01:01:05.403 --> 01:01:08.607 align:middle line:84%
and have you work until
you're 65, 70, 80 years old,

01:01:08.607 --> 01:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
draining every bit of
life out of your body.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.857 align:middle line:84%
You're dying at
70, but you should

01:01:11.857 --> 01:01:13.613 align:middle line:90%
be living to 150, 200 years.

01:01:13.613 --> 01:01:15.030 align:middle line:84%
But because of all
the poison that

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
they put into your body
and everything else.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
They do this to keep you dumbed
down, keep you dying early,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.780 align:middle line:84%
keep you so preoccupied
with having to go to work

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:24.300 align:middle line:84%
and pay bills so that
you don't find this out.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:28.590 align:middle line:90%


01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
Again, as above, so below.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So when you're looking here,
you look at a brain cell,

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and look at the
universe zoomed out.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You look at the
birth of a cell, you

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:36.457 align:middle line:90%
look at the death of a star.

01:01:36.457 --> 01:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You look at your iris
and you look at a nebula.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:39.820 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.780 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.400 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
software program

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.900 align:middle line:90%
that interfaces with itself.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's self similar
on every single level.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the Osirian temple
which I've been to in person.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
If you go on my page, you can
see me walking around here.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.125 align:middle line:84%
It's partially buried in
water or submerged in water

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:59.080 align:middle line:84%
at certain times of the
year, as the Nile or whatever

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.810 align:middle line:84%
feeds it rises and
falls from time to time.

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, when I was
there it was down.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.410 align:middle line:84%
This image here is the flower
of life atomically etched

01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
into a stone pillar
at the Osirian temple,

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.860 align:middle line:84%
right behind the temple
of Abydos in Egypt.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
knowledge of this goes back.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
This Osirian temple is
not 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:28.532 align:middle line:84%
This Osirian temple is probably
60,000, 70,000 years old.

01:02:28.532 --> 01:02:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, just coincidence.

01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:30.643 align:middle line:90%
It just happened.

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
They just came up with the
idea of a pattern in their head

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and exited in there somehow
atomically into the pillar.

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They knew about this from
ancient, ancient times.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.676 align:middle line:10%
And you're looking at,
again, the face of God.

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.580 align:middle line:10%
When you're looking
at our solar system,

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:46.100 align:middle line:10%
when you're looking
at an atom, when

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.620 align:middle line:10%
you're looking at the
electrons orbiting an atom.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.350 align:middle line:84%
In a solar system, planets
can change position.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:52.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you knew that.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:56.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the scientific
data of our solar system

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you find that I
believe it was maybe

01:02:59.770 --> 01:03:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Saturn and Jupiter
switched positions

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in ancient times because of a
very large rogue planet that

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.320 align:middle line:90%
passed through.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Wonder which planet that was.

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.515 align:middle line:84%
When you read to
enumerated list,

01:03:08.515 --> 01:03:10.688 align:middle line:84%
you discover it was Marduk,
or also known as Nibiru,

01:03:10.688 --> 01:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
passed through our solar
system in ancient times.

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Gravitational field of
that caused two planets

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.050 align:middle line:90%
to shift position.

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Scientifically proven.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Look at an electron.

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:21.940 align:middle line:90%


01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
When an atom combines or
crashes into another atom,

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
energetically,
sometimes electrons

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
will change position or jump to
higher orbits around that atom,

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.820 align:middle line:90%
based on the collision.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
So you see,
everything, it's all--

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:38.800 align:middle line:84%
no matter what skill you go
to, subatomic or classical,

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.710 align:middle line:84%
you always find out
the similarities.

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:44.620 align:middle line:84%
This is going to give you
a quick idea relatively

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%
about cymatics--

[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:47.568 --> 01:03:49.536 align:middle line:84%
--and how things
relate to each other.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:59.048 align:middle line:10%
In the lower corner, you see
Earth's path around the Sun

01:03:59.048 --> 01:04:01.952 align:middle line:10%
as it creates a fractal pattern.

01:04:01.952 --> 01:04:04.372 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:04:04.372 --> 01:04:06.792 align:middle line:90%


01:04:06.792 --> 01:04:07.760 align:middle line:90%
All sacred geometry.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:12.620 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:17.990 align:middle line:10%
On the other side, you see a
speaker vibrating, and creating

01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:22.160 align:middle line:10%
cymatic geometric images, as
well as the audio levitation

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.128 align:middle line:10%
through frequencies

01:04:38.530 --> 01:04:41.220 align:middle line:10%
You see the vector equilibrium
from the water droplets,

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.210 align:middle line:10%
they've formed into
a Metatron's cube.

[LAUGHS] Through
frequencies and vibration.

01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
By the way, did
you like that song?

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:49.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.864 align:middle line:90%
That's my song.

[LAUGHTER]

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.630 align:middle line:10%
So go to Apple, iTunes, go
to Google Play, Spotify,

01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:59.940 align:middle line:10%
and just look up
Forbidden Knowledge.

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.970 align:middle line:10%
And I've got quite a
few songs up there.

01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:03.502 align:middle line:10%
Please play them, stream them.

01:05:03.502 --> 01:05:04.335 align:middle line:10%
Don't download them.

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:06.127 align:middle line:10%
Just keep playing them
over and over again.

01:05:06.127 --> 01:05:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Because it helps with
my future college

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.537 align:middle line:10%
funds for future children.

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:12.700 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.450 align:middle line:10%
Thank you for the
shameless plug.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.250 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, I see.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.333 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to give you one
more quick demonstration

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:21.090 align:middle line:10%
before I start to kind of close
this thing out and give you

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:24.110 align:middle line:10%
the summary of everything here.

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:25.310 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:26.977 align:middle line:10%
Something you may
have never considered.

01:05:26.977 --> 01:05:30.320 align:middle line:10%
On the top left, this is you
as a spermatozoa originally.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.460 align:middle line:10%
That's the male energy
of the universe.

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.280 align:middle line:10%
The female energy is actually
the energetic particle

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.810 align:middle line:10%
streaming out of
the vesica pisces,

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.450 align:middle line:10%
which actually creates dark
matter and everything else.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But as you see, these sperms
are trying to penetrate an egg.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.800 align:middle line:10%
And as you see, on
the opposite side,

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.900 align:middle line:10%
one lucky guy gets through.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.940 align:middle line:10%
So he gets in there.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.240 align:middle line:10%
He's squeezing through
and gets to the inside.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.223 align:middle line:10%


01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:01.390 align:middle line:10%
And once that happens,
that's when the spark of life

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:05.650 align:middle line:10%
occurs, in terms of the
cell division process,

01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:07.270 align:middle line:10%
to start that seed
of life formation.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:11.230 align:middle line:10%
Then in the lower corner,
you see a human brain,

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.418 align:middle line:10%
and a spinal cord.

01:06:12.418 --> 01:06:13.960 align:middle line:10%
Now, that spinal
cord and human brain

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.653 align:middle line:10%
look very similar to a sperm.

01:06:15.653 --> 01:06:17.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, I'm not saying
it is a sperm.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.237 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, it's not, because
more complex structures

01:06:19.237 --> 01:06:22.780 align:middle line:10%
have gone together to create a
human brain and a spinal cord.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.980 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm saying is, they
look very, very similar.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.160 align:middle line:10%
And that's important to
understand how these two

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:33.040 align:middle line:10%
objects are very similar.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:34.538 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

01:06:34.538 --> 01:06:36.580 align:middle line:10%
And all of this stuff on
the outside of your body

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:41.040 align:middle line:10%
is just there to help keep
that spinal cord and that brain

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.000 align:middle line:10%
stem alive.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.113 align:middle line:10%
So it's just another way of
looking at, as above, so below.

01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:49.030 align:middle line:10%
So this is a meme that
I made a long time ago.

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:50.140 align:middle line:10%
"Hello, I am the universe.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.270 align:middle line:10%
And it is a pleasure for
you to meet yourself."

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:56.010 align:middle line:10%
So you have to understand
that you are the universe,

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:57.010 align:middle line:10%
and the universe is you.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:58.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you
understand that, you'll

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.390 align:middle line:10%
start to operate
differently in your life.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Your life will completely
transcend and change.

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Not instantaneously,
but over time.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the changes
happen and occur

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.540 align:middle line:84%
when you realize the true
power that's inside of you

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.860 align:middle line:90%
and is flowing through you.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.590 align:middle line:10%
And that you actually
take part in co-creation

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:18.510 align:middle line:10%
of this whole dimension
and this whole reality.

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.688 align:middle line:10%
Let's take a quick look
at what is a hologram.

01:07:20.688 --> 01:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a three-dimensional
image formed

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:24.060 align:middle line:84%
by the interference
of light beams

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.310 align:middle line:84%
from a laser or other
coherent light source.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.410 align:middle line:10%
A photograph of an
interference pattern

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.240 align:middle line:10%
that, when suitably
illuminated, produces

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.320 align:middle line:10%
a three-dimensional image.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.600 align:middle line:10%
That's what a hologram is.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.270 align:middle line:10%
There's something above
dimensions above dimensions

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:37.140 align:middle line:10%
above dimensions.

01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.722 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very
sophisticated device.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into a lot
of what quantum physicists are

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
saying, they're all coming
to the same agreement now,

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that, they
believe that we're not

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.527 align:middle line:90%
living in base reality.

01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, base
reality, wherever

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
that is, wherever
that started, that's

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:51.883 align:middle line:90%
still a big giant question mark.

01:07:51.883 --> 01:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%
How did all this begin?

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.210 align:middle line:90%
How did it all start?

01:07:54.210 --> 01:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
At some particular
point, something

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
started these universal patterns
or these multi-versal patterns.

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.198 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some point, beings
got sophisticated enough--

01:08:05.198 --> 01:08:07.740 align:middle line:84%
or an entity, or divine energy,
whatever you want to call it,

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:08.970 align:middle line:90%
your god--

01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and started recreating, and
recreating, and recreating.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.870 align:middle line:84%
When you look at a
hologram, you got

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.729 align:middle line:90%
to realize that it's a copy.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:19.979 align:middle line:10%
And when you take a small
piece of that hologram

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:22.439 align:middle line:10%
out and look at it, you're
going to find the entire whole

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:23.790 align:middle line:10%
in that smallest piece.

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
happening here with us.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:28.050 align:middle line:90%
And we are the Sims.

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Anybody know what the
Sims video game is?

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.189 align:middle line:84%
It's a video game, if you don't
know, that people live in.

01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:38.310 align:middle line:84%
They have husbands, and wives,
and cats, and dogs, and babies.

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:39.899 align:middle line:90%
And they travel to work.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And they come home
and everything else.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Just like a regular
person, a regular family.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
They go to clubs, and party,
and all this crazy stuff.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:49.319 align:middle line:84%
And we control them
to a certain point.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And they kind of do their thing.

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, the creator
of the Sims is now

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
saying that the game
will be conscious through

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.609 align:middle line:90%
artificial intelligence.

01:08:56.609 --> 01:08:58.010 align:middle line:90%
Originally, it was within 20.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:01.569 align:middle line:84%
But now, it's down to
between 5 to 8 years.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:05.010 align:middle line:84%
5 to 8 years from now,
the Sims video game

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:08.819 align:middle line:84%
will have conscious entities
living inside of it.

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Will their Big Bang
be when we turn

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.649 align:middle line:90%
the switch on the game console?

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.520 align:middle line:90%
Is that the Big Bang for them?

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.569 align:middle line:84%
And then, they're going to
begin to question, who are we?

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
Where did we come from?

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.859 align:middle line:90%
Who is our God?

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:21.873 align:middle line:90%
What level of reality are we at?

01:09:21.873 --> 01:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, will they begin
to develop and build

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:26.520 align:middle line:90%
their own video games?

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, will they inject
artificial intelligence

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:32.370 align:middle line:84%
into their games, creating
another universe that's

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:33.510 align:middle line:90%
artificial?

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:35.640 align:middle line:84%
What level of reality
are we living in?

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.760 align:middle line:10%
There could be trillions and
trillions of levels to reality.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.240 align:middle line:84%
We could hypothetically
be living

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.109 align:middle line:84%
in the science project
of some high school

01:09:43.109 --> 01:09:45.299 align:middle line:90%
kid in another dimension.

01:09:45.299 --> 01:09:47.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It sounds far fetched, but in
true reality it's possible.

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:52.729 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.850 align:middle line:10%
If you saw the movie
"Men in Black,"

01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
where they had an entire
galaxy on a necklace.

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:middle line:10%
And inside that
galaxy were probably

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.620 align:middle line:10%
billions of entities living.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.420 align:middle line:10%
OK?

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:04.830 align:middle line:10%
This is the kind
of thing you have

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:05.820 align:middle line:10%
to stretch and wrap your mind.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:08.070 align:middle line:10%
It's very hard to wrap your
mind completely around it.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:11.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's what we believe
is really happening.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:16.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to wrap
this up here with this.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:18.155 align:middle line:10%
I think this is very important.

01:10:18.155 --> 01:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
I wanted to say

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.620 align:middle line:84%
was that I don't believe
that God is a man.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:24.495 align:middle line:84%
So when I hear people
referencing, he, he,

01:10:24.495 --> 01:10:25.680 align:middle line:84%
he can do this,
and he can do that,

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to save
us, and everything else.

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
creator of the universe

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.400 align:middle line:84%
is represented by a
geometric image called

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.200 align:middle line:90%
the flower of life.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.117 align:middle line:90%
That's what I believe.

01:10:37.117 --> 01:10:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
above that, that interjects

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:41.450 align:middle line:90%
or interfaces with that.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
That, I don't know
of at this time.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I have obviously have to
pass out of this dimension

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.010 align:middle line:90%
to learn that.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I have learned is
that the energetic energy

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that comes in through the flower
of life is feminine by nature.

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.650 align:middle line:90%
And that's the vesica pisces.

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
This is where the two
circles intersect and create

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.110 align:middle line:84%
a portal opening, which is
called the womb of creation.

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Hey, guys, Forbidden
Knowledge here.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.652 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you real
quick about the vesica

01:11:03.652 --> 01:11:06.620 align:middle line:90%
pisces, the womb of creation.

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
A circle actually
has two points,

01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
point A and point B.
These two single points

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
are actually clones
of one another.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:17.060 align:middle line:10%
And those two points
have equal potential,

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:19.640 align:middle line:10%
because point A can
rotate around point B,

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.150 align:middle line:10%
and point B can
rotate around point A.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:26.570 align:middle line:10%
This is one radius that
both circles share.

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:30.170 align:middle line:10%
The black form in the middle
is called the vesica pisces.

01:11:30.170 --> 01:11:34.010 align:middle line:10%
You are literally looking
at the womb of the universe.

01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:36.740 align:middle line:10%
Every single thing that exists
emanates from the vesica

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.120 align:middle line:10%
pisces.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean all.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:43.850 align:middle line:10%
All of the vibratory frequencies
that create a material world

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:46.760 align:middle line:10%
actually emanate from this womb.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The energy from the matrix
is feminine by nature.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
it the Sofia energy.

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:57.260 align:middle line:10%
They already knew the universal
energy was actually feminine.

01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:01.550 align:middle line:10%
And this is why you see a
big suppression of femininity

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:03.060 align:middle line:10%
in the world today.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.038 align:middle line:10%
If you've ever been
to Egypt or anywhere

01:12:05.038 --> 01:12:07.580 align:middle line:10%
in the Middle East, where a lot
of the cradle of civilization

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:11.060 align:middle line:10%
really started, you see
the oppression of women.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
You even see it here
in the Americas.

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
You see it all over the
world, because they want

01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.980 align:middle line:90%
us to suppress the femininity.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:18.605 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't want women to
know how powerful they really,

01:12:18.605 --> 01:12:20.310 align:middle line:84%
truly are, the power
that's in them.

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:21.110 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:22.752 align:middle line:90%
I would applaud yourself.

01:12:22.752 --> 01:12:24.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, because listen.

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:26.280 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes out of a womb.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, everything
in this dimension.

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Not only through
energetically, but then also

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.460 align:middle line:90%
biologically for us.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.330 align:middle line:10%
We're coming out
of a womb, as well.

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And women are the
most powerful beings

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.040 align:middle line:90%
on the face of this planet.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.000 align:middle line:90%
But that's been kept out.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And you've been kept out
of going to synagogues,

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
kept out of being
able to go to church,

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:48.277 align:middle line:84%
kept out of being
able to vote, kept out

01:12:48.277 --> 01:12:50.000 align:middle line:84%
of being able to
work this or do that,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.140 align:middle line:84%
kept out of being able to
have these same rights as men,

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:54.140 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and so on.

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And then and survive alone
all these other places.

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:59.867 align:middle line:10%
You've been forced to even
suppress your own looks.

01:12:59.867 --> 01:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
You can't wear, you got to
cover your whole body and all

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.000 align:middle line:90%
this other.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.175 align:middle line:10%
This is all about
suppression of this.

01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:07.550 align:middle line:84%
That's what it
all stems back to.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, do the people that
are doing this to the women

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
these days really understand
and know this at this point?

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:13.830 align:middle line:10%
No, but it's been handed down
for so many thousands of years

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.265 align:middle line:10%
it's become part of culture now.

01:13:15.265 --> 01:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
But this was the
original source.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
It's to suppress women from
knowing how truly powerful

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.510 align:middle line:90%
they really are.

01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:23.800 align:middle line:10%
So I want to thank everybody
for coming out to my talk today.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:28.720 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:35.446 align:middle line:90%
