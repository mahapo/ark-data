00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, folks.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.810 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have a nice
little intimate event here.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.330 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I don't
look at these workshops

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:90%
the way most of the speakers do.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.190 align:middle line:90%
It's not another lecture.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Please come to the front.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
If you're here to listen,
please come on up to the front.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.695 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going to be
spraying in the back later.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.595 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:36.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lot of chemtrails.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, you're paying extra
to come and hang out with me,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:90%
above the regular.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And so in my view,
this is your time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And so as we go forward,
this is unlimited Q&A. Ask

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:90%
a question anytime you want.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking down at the
computer, just say question.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
If I'm looking up,
just raise your hand.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.813 align:middle line:84%
Even in the middle
of a clip, if you

00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:00.980 align:middle line:84%
feel the need to ask a
question, I'll stop the clip.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.120 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.175 align:middle line:84%
We can have all the
interaction you want.

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:06.050 align:middle line:90%
We're good till 7:30.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.633 align:middle line:84%
But we are the last one of the
night, so if things are rocking

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.158 align:middle line:84%
and we want to go a little
bit later, we can, I think.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I think the crew probably
wants to go home.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But we might be able to squeeze
15, 20 minutes out of them.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get that
out of the way.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Now I have a confession to make.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
I feel a little
shame about this.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
But I really haven't
said this before.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is
the time to do it.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.535 align:middle line:90%
I've never been to Mars.

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:90%
I haven't been to the moon.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:90%
I've never teleported anywhere.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I have never time traveled.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:90%
I've never been age regressed.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:90%
And yet, here I am.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:90%
And here you are.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your coming.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:90%
My job is fairly boring.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.910 align:middle line:84%
It's politics,
which as you know,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
has been extremely
popular of late.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's activist politics,
exopolitical activism,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:90%
disclosure activism.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.325 align:middle line:90%
It's a simple thing.

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The government has been
misrepresenting the ET reality

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:90%
for 70 years for its reasons.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reasons for
that are not too bad.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
But finally, it
just got ridiculous.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the world started
going to hell in a handbasket

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
unless you're extremely
rich, of which I'm

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:90%
pretty sure none of you are.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And the whole disconnect
between government secrecy

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:84%
and their little
private secret world

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and what the hell
we're dealing with here

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:90%
is now becoming intolerable.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
Plus the fact that almost
everybody in the world

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
knows there's extraterrestrials,
either out there

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:90%
or here already.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the lie is
becoming more than a joke.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.000 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming a
bizarre kabuki theater.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:90%
So it needs to end.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And I entered the field
in '96 to help end it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.080 align:middle line:84%
by engaging the
politics of this.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Because while I was
working up at John Mack's

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
little organization
in Cambridge,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:90%
it came to me in a flash--

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
was on anything--

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:90%
that the problem is not science.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.340 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that at all.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.140 align:middle line:90%
We got evidence.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
We got evidence piled
up on top of evidence.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.202 align:middle line:90%
It's not science.

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:90%
It should have been resolved.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Should've been out in the open.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Why wasn't it?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Politics-- it was a
political decision

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.210 align:middle line:84%
made that we don't care
how much science you have,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hynek, Dr.
McDonald, Mr. Keyhoe.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter-- they don't
exist, politically speaking.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't exist.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it is.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to start
off a course at a college,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
it'll probably become
uncomfortable for you.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.000 align:middle line:84%
If you want to give
out inside information,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
we'll make your life tough.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:90%
There'll be laughs.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:90%
There'll be giggles.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.203 align:middle line:90%
You might lose a job.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:06.370 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to kill you.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
This isn't Stalinist
Soviet Union or anything.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We're Americans, moral
high ground and all that--

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:90%
not too many got killed.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
But we're really
good at what we do,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.524 align:middle line:84%
which is intel, co-intel,
propaganda, and all that.

00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
Because we had to be.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.652 align:middle line:84%
We were up against
other countries

00:04:23.652 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
with intel, and
propaganda, and co-intel.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:90%
And we had to be good at it.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then those tools
became available.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, well, if we've
got a problem here in the US

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
with some fine
American citizens,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should use those
tools, too, on them.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.920 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%
And so it's 2019.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.337 align:middle line:84%
And this ludicrous
lie continues.

00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
While all of the other
dysfunctions on this planet

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:90%
continue and rage on.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.660 align:middle line:90%
And nothing is getting done.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:90%
People are suffering, dying.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Countries are collapsing.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.493 align:middle line:84%
And yet tomorrow, every
single person on the planet

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
could learn they're not
alone in the universe,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.997 align:middle line:84%
that there's
extraterrestrials here.

00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And the implications
of that are staggering.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.830 align:middle line:90%
The future is unlimited.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:90%
But no, they don't know that.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:90%
You know that the US--

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
what do you call
it, not deficit--

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
debt is $22 trillion.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:90%
You know that right?

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.327 align:middle line:90%
You're well aware of that.

00:05:21.327 --> 00:05:22.660 align:middle line:90%
The national debt is a trillion.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.152 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the debt this year was
over a trillion over budget.

00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And everything else is wrong.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:90%
You knew all that.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know officially
there's extraterrestrial life.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So that's the deal.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not exciting.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not dramatic.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.280 align:middle line:90%
It's not sexy.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have a
lot of charisma.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.638 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting
politicians to do something,

00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people believe
cannot even be done anymore.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.612 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:05:45.612 --> 00:05:47.320 align:middle line:84%
It's getting politicians
to say something

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.528 align:middle line:84%
that you will actually
believe, which a lot of people

00:05:49.528 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:84%
feel doesn't even
happen anymore.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.490 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is we're
going to talk about history.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:90%
History is an interesting thing.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
It happens, we know, because
we read about it in school.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, some of us did.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%
I didn't like history class.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:90%
I had ADDH.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.585 align:middle line:90%
I still do.

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:12.960 align:middle line:84%
But later I learned
a little bit.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.585 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
history is fantastic

00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and extraordinary
things happened.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But you know, at the
time they're happening,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
most of the people
don't know it.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:90%
It's in real time.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of happening
sort of around them.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:90%
They don't know.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize
what's going down.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.137 align:middle line:84%
Not always-- I
think, as the Civil

00:06:30.137 --> 00:06:31.720 align:middle line:84%
War got going, most
of the people that

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
were kind of in the middle
of that were thinking, yeah,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
some history going on here,
though they would never

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.590 align:middle line:90%
know the full scope of it.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Alexander conquered
most of the world

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
from the Mediterranean
east to India.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And not a single person in
South America knew he existed.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
So this is the way it is.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And the point I'm
going to make here

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
is that history is happening
right now at a huge level.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think too
many of you know it.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to try
to talk about that--

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:90%
and again, anytime a question.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Paradigm Research
Group, that's me.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:10%
That's my website,
ParadigmResearchGroup.org.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.488 align:middle line:10%
You can subscribe to
my newsletter there.

00:07:15.488 --> 00:07:17.238 align:middle line:10%
And that newsletter--
it's an update list.

00:07:17.238 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:10%
It's free.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:10%
Huge site, tons of stuff on it--

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.880 align:middle line:10%
just letting you know
what's coming up.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:84%
"Ancient Aliens" has
already indicated

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to me they're going
to do another two hour

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.477 align:middle line:84%
disclosure based "Ancient
Aliens" later this year.

00:07:31.477 --> 00:07:34.060 align:middle line:84%
They were going to do it early,
but they decided to put it off

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
because big things
are in the works.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.695 align:middle line:84%
So Ancient Aliens
two hour series,

00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be called--

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:84%
two hour episode, "The
Disclosure Countdown"--

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:90%
music to my ears.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:90%
And I will be on that.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Me in my second
"Ancient Alien" show--

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm now an alumnus.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you they could
possibly have been, like,

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
tapped to help with disclosure?

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Tapped?

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, yeah, like,
by the government.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
motivation for Hollywood

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.505 align:middle line:84%
to jump into this
with both feet.

00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:02.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't need the government
tapping them at all.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And the government knows that.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And doing that kind of thing
just exposes your situation.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.102 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be doing it.

00:08:10.102 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But we're so glad
they're doing it.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Feel free to come to
the front, please.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.645 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's necessary.

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:17.020 align:middle line:84%
They're back
there's been tested.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It is not fit to breathe.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And so the other thing
is "Ancient Aliens"

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
and the History Channel launched
a cross between Comic-Con

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and a UFO conference
called AlienCon.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And they have the ability
to promote it extensively,

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.749 align:middle line:84%
because "Ancient Aliens" runs,
as you know, what 50, 60 times

00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:90%
a week--

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
in fact, all day every Friday.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.086 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] Isn't that cool?

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:90%
And so they can advertise.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:45.145 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Now the first one was
up in the San Francisco

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:90%
area, Santa Clarita.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I think they had 5,000.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
And then they did
Pasadena late last year--

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
AlienCon Pasadena, at the
convention center in Pasadena,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:90%
8,000.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they went to
AlienCon Baltimore.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
This was late last
year, and 10,000

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:84%
at the Baltimore Convention
Center, Pasadena Convention

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
Center.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And so now they're
ready to go big time.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And so end of June, AlienCon
will be held at the Los Angeles

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Convention Center, one
of the biggest convention

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:90%
centers in the world.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And I predict there'll be
20,000 to 25,000 people there

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
for a UFO conference
with some cosplay.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can get photos with
Richard Dolan, all right?

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:38.052 align:middle line:84%
That gives you a sense of
what's going on here, all right?

00:09:38.052 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, History
just launched a series

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
called "Project
Blue Book", which

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.220 align:middle line:84%
is going to make J. Allen
Hynek a household name.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
It's just been picked up
for the second season.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And they have some
more in the works.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be aliens
all the time, folks.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.550 align:middle line:90%
But will we get disclosure?

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
Or are we just going to get that
and for more "Avatar" sequels?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way, have already
been in the can in New Zealand.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They're done--
Cameron-- all four.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And they will be coming out
over the next three years.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And everyone will make a billion
and a half, two billion bucks.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:90%
But will we get disclosure?

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Look, I love entertainment,
like anybody.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But I really don't think I need
to be entertained to death.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have some
entertainment mixed

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:84%
in with some truth about my
government and my country.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
I will be at the
Sonoma Film Festival,

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.510 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the coolest
film festivals of all time.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.854 align:middle line:90%
It's the end of this month--

00:10:36.854 --> 00:10:39.910 align:middle line:84%
no, next month,
March 27 to March 31.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.370 align:middle line:90%
UFO Symposium is all free.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
If you like wine and great food,
join us up there in Sonoma.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:10%
I will be at Contact In The
Desert May 31 to June 3.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:10%
Probably going to be 4,000
at that one, very possible,

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:10%
in Indian Wells, which is
basically Palm Springs.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I will be
at the AlienCon.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.190 align:middle line:84%
And then in August I will be at
the Alien Expo, the first UFO

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
conference in the
history of Tennessee.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And it will be at the
Knoxville Convention Center.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So even Tennessee
is going big time.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And so come on out
to Tennessee, folks.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.142 align:middle line:90%
I'm looking forward to that.

00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking
about To The Stars Academy.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
How many people know
what the To The Stars

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.965 align:middle line:90%
Academy of Arts and Science is?

00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Not many-- good,
good, good, good--

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and what the focus is on
that, but we're approaching it

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
from kind of a
political perspective,

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
it is the most important event
or development in the history

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of the disclosure movement.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
I pretty much felt,
up until recently,

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
that the citizen
hearing on disclosure

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.510 align:middle line:84%
was the most important event in
the history of the disclosure

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Not simply because I put
it together and organized

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
it-- no, no, no, no,
no, no, but because it

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:90%
was pretty important.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:90%
But no, not now--

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:90%
they are number one.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
What they're doing is
the most important.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And the timeline-- and we'll
get to the particulars.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.540 align:middle line:84%
But the timeline
is a young fellow

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:17.580 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Tom DeLonge,
who is a millennial rock

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.480 align:middle line:90%
star, sold 30 million records.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And he started
meeting with people

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:84%
inside the military intelligence
complex sometime in 2015.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't know exactly when.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And none of that was known.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But the beginning of this
history that I'm talking about

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:90%
starts here, March 27, 2016.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
This is when we first
learned publicly

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.100 align:middle line:90%
that something is going on.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And we learn it
because George Knapp,

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
who had been working with Tom
DeLonge-- he's a journalist.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
But he's aware of Tom DeLonge.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:90%
They're talking.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.470 align:middle line:84%
George Knapp brings him
on "Coast to Coast AM"

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Sunday night when George hosts
the show and interviews him.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:90%
But this is no interview.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.452 align:middle line:84%
George Knapp basically was doing
this as an historical moment,

00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:90%
and he sort of knew it.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
But he couldn't say it.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.605 align:middle line:90%
And this is when it all starts.

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Now what I have done is I've
gone through the entire four

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:90%
hour show.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.243 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
select out some clips.

00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
comment on these clips.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're in chronological
order to the show.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't rearrange
them so somehow they

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
were in chronological
order otherwise.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:90%
But it's OK.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.150 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It'll just make it
more interesting.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm doing
this so that you

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:84%
can hear the beginning of this
history, when it starts, right?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I think
very few of you--

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:84%
has anybody heard that
March George Knapp show?

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.470 align:middle line:90%
Two!

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.122 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking maybe
what, 8% of the population?

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
That means that
we're going to have

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.210 align:middle line:90%
to do a lot more conferences.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:90%
So here we go, ba da bing.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:01.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to-- and
there is George,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.490 align:middle line:90%
and there is Tom DeLonge.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.822 align:middle line:10%
I'm now going to
go over here and--

00:14:06.822 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:10%
oh, wait a minute-- and
I'm going to do this.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.900 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And then I'm going to do this.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.280 align:middle line:84%
This will speed up
as we get going here.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.530 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Good evening, everyone.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
You're in the right
place at the right time.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:84%
This is "Coast to
Coast AM", blasting out

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
of the Mojave Desert
like a scirocco blazing

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.410 align:middle line:90%
across the land.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.827 align:middle line:84%
>> He's got a great opening,
if you're interested in that.

00:14:33.827 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that people will be
talking about for a long time,

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:84%
the kind of program
that tomorrow,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
you and your friends
around the water cooler,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.920 align:middle line:84%
you'll be asking each other,
what did you think about that?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.240 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear that?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:90%
What the?

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the UFO
topic long enough,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
you start to see
cycles, stuff that

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.090 align:middle line:90%
comes in predictable waves.

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And long ago, it used to
be the saucers themselves.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:84%
They'd suddenly flood the skies
in waves all over the world.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
In more recent years, it's
been waves of stories,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
sometimes disinformation,
anticipation,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
predictions of
imminent disclosure.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, any minute now we're going
to roll open the hangar doors

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and let us see the
recovered alien spacecraft.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Family tours of Area 51--

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
bring mom, bring the kids, toss
grandpa in the station wagon.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Head out to Groom Lake
to see the alien bodies

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:90%
in formaldehyde.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:90%
And then, months drag on.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Years go by.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.713 align:middle line:84%
Then someone else
starts leaking the story

00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
that the big announcement
is just around the corner.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.297 align:middle line:84%
We've been through
it a few times.

00:15:35.297 --> 00:15:37.120 align:middle line:84%
A couple of times when
this has happened,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
when the buzz has been building
up to a near crescendo,

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.730 align:middle line:84%
it was done on purpose
to mess with our heads,

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to confuse the Russians,
maybe, to watch and learn

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.405 align:middle line:84%
how information spreads
in the digital age,

00:15:49.405 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
or for other purposes maybe
we can't even imagine.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
A few times the buzz was
started by presidents

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.140 align:middle line:90%
or presidential candidates.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Jimmy Carter promised
to open up the UFO files

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
if he got elected,
because he'd seen one.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Ronald Reagan, who also
had a UFO experience,

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
talked about aliens in
five different speeches,

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.780 align:middle line:84%
including one he made
to the United Nations.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Bill Clinton made no secret
of his interest in the topic.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.570 align:middle line:84%
He sent one of his
closest friends to Area 51

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.100 align:middle line:90%
to find out what was up.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And his wife Hillary,
first lady at the time,

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.140 align:middle line:90%
met with Lawrence Rockefeller.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Their White House
Chief of Staff,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.470 align:middle line:84%
a guy named John Podesta,
has been widely quoted

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
for years now talking about
his personal interest in UFOs,

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.310 align:middle line:84%
finding and releasing
the UFO files.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you can hear it.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:90%
But the buzz is building again.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Clinton, whether
you believe it or not,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:90%
she is running for president.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
She's probably going
to get the nomination.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.150 align:middle line:84%
She made comments to a
reporter a couple of months ago

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.040 align:middle line:84%
and then to Jimmy
Kimmel a few nights ago

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:84%
saying she wants to locate and
open whatever UFO files exist.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Whether you believe
it or not, it

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is remarkable that we have a
major presidential candidate

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.000 align:middle line:84%
talking about this
during the campaign.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned last week
that I had aired a TV news

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
story based on an interview
with John Podesta.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.859 align:middle line:84%
In which Podesta was saying
basically the same thing

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:11.560 align:middle line:84%
as his candidate,
Secretary Clinton,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.380 align:middle line:84%
about finding and
releasing the UFO files.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
That story was picked
up all over the world,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
repackaged and
reported, re-reported.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you heard our
colleague Linda Howe

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.180 align:middle line:84%
telling her audiences
that 2016 is

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
going to be a big year about
revelations on this topic.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Late last year, a panel
of former CIA employees

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:34.780 align:middle line:90%
openly talked about Area 51.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that long ago that
agency and the military both

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.840 align:middle line:84%
pretended there is no
base out there at all.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.060 align:middle line:90%
It's nonexistent.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Then they denied it was
ever called Area 51.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now they're having
open discussions

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
in the public at
museums about some

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
of the programs carried out
there in secrecy in the desert.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing turnaround.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Earlier this year, when
"The X Files" TV series

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
returned to television,
the CIA and the FBI

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
both made a point of telling
the public, hey, go online.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.000 align:middle line:90%
Check out our UFO files.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We got it posted
there-- documents

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
that have been released under
the Freedom of Information Act.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
signs, other benchmarks

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.520 align:middle line:90%
that we will discuss tonight.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
It makes you wonder
what's going on here.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And into the middle
of this buzz,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
comes Tom DeLonge, a rock star,
seemingly an improbable UFO

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:90%
messiah.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Could Tom DeLonge
do what generations

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
of UFO researchers, scientists,
government insiders,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and whistleblowers
have been unable to do?

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Tell the story, dig
out the real story,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:84%
and tell it in a way that
has not been told before--

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.020 align:middle line:84%
how to make sense out
of the alleged cover

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.870 align:middle line:84%
up, why it started, how
it's been maintained.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
But also to understand
who the visitors are,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
or more precisely,
who the "others" are.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using air quotes
around the "others."

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the term used by
some of the high level

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
sources developed by
musician Tom DeLonge.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.860 align:middle line:84%
The story of how he
got to where he is

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:84%
and what he has learned
so far should be a movie.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it will be a movie.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But over the next four hours,
we're going to hear this tale.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.390 align:middle line:84%
How he started down
this unlikely road,

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
the dramatic business decision
he made about a year ago,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
changing the
direction of his life

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and his fortune, and
the amazing series,

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
or chain of events, which
have led Tom from one insider

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to another to another,
stitching together

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.970 align:middle line:84%
an informal network
of like-minded people

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
who now seem to want the
public to know the story.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
If you think you
know how it works

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
or why it's been handled this
way, hold onto your seats.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.600 align:middle line:84%
Because the tale you're going
to hear tonight will turn things

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:90%
upside down.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to admit that is
one hell of an introduction,

00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
>> George is good at that.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:90%
He's very, very sharp.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.780 align:middle line:84%
He's a top investigative
journalist.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
He's kept his job in spite
of all of his ET interests

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.430 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
He's locked in at
KLAS-TV in Las Vegas.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:15.100 align:middle line:90%
But a couple of quick comments--

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.940 align:middle line:84%
it is always the case
that when the youth arrive

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
at the issues of our
time and take them over,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
they have a tendency to
forget that anybody else was

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
doing anything about it for
whatever years previous.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It's their issue.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And that is the way it is.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And one either deals
with that or they don't.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.210 align:middle line:90%
but that's the way it goes.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.018 align:middle line:84%
I was young once,
I vaguely recall.

00:20:42.018 --> 00:20:43.810 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I want
to mention is this--

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard from
George in about two years.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.215 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know why.

00:20:46.215 --> 00:20:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It bothers me.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But he was amazed that Clinton
was talking about the ET issue

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and that Podesta was
talking about the ET issue.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
heard one or more

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of those comments
when she talked

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.447 align:middle line:84%
about it on Kimmel or
Podesta, Obama, and so forth?

00:21:04.447 --> 00:21:05.513 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:05.513 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
What George has never
talked to me about

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that the reason
that they were doing that

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.670 align:middle line:90%
is because I forced them to.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to toot my horn
here at least a little bit.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to talk about it.

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, I went back
to Washington in November 2014,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
delivered the entire "Citizen
Hearing on Disclosure"

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:31.360 align:middle line:84%
DVD set with the Podesta
testimony or the Rockefeller

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.700 align:middle line:84%
initiative testimony and
the Clinton connection

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to every member of Congress.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And started-- and
then got my publicist,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and we started hitting
the media up to say,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.877 align:middle line:90%
this is a story here.

00:21:39.877 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You got the leading
candidate for president.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And she's got a connection
to the ET issue.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Her husband does.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.987 align:middle line:90%
Podesta does, right?

00:21:45.987 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:90%
There's all this evidence.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.195 align:middle line:90%
It's always been out there.

00:21:48.195 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:90%
And they got it.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:90%
They go, yeah, this is a story.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And before the
election took place,

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:84%
400 articles were written
about the connection

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:84%
between the Clinton
team and the ET issue--

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:90%
400.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Nothing had ever happened
like that before,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:90%
not even remotely that close.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that happened is
because once you get reporters

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:90%
into a story--

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and I was working at one
point on a source relationship

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.510 align:middle line:90%
with 40, 42 of them--

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
when they do a
story, naturally they

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
want to call up the
people in the story

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.520 align:middle line:90%
and get their comments.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And so they were calling
Clinton's office,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.537 align:middle line:84%
and they were calling
Podesta's office, and saying,

00:22:28.537 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:90%
would you comment on this?

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.662 align:middle line:84%
Or at least they were
saying it to the secretary,

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:33.635 align:middle line:84%
because they never
got an answer back.

00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no way the
Clinton team could

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.120 align:middle line:90%
respond to those questions.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they knew
if they got in a Q&A

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
with "The New York Times"
reporter about some

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:84%
of these articles, then it
would escalate really fast,

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and the whole thing
would blow sky high.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And what she wanted
to do is one,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:90%
she wanted to be president.

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
She fully intended to force the
disclosure out, as president.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't want to talk
about it during the campaign,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
because she was afraid she
might lose by talking about ETs.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, she was wrong on that.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But I understand why
they thought that way.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And so what Podesta
had to do is devise

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.047 align:middle line:84%
a kind of carefully regulated,
controlled situation

00:23:14.047 --> 00:23:15.505 align:middle line:84%
where they could
say something here

00:23:15.505 --> 00:23:19.060 align:middle line:84%
or something there, but
not get into a Q&A dialogue

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
with Amy Chozick of
"The New York Times."

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And it started on
February the 13th

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.185 align:middle line:84%
when he put out the infamous
tweet from the White House

00:23:26.185 --> 00:23:28.560 align:middle line:84%
as he walked out the door to
become her campaign manager.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
That was his first response
to these stories and reporters

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:84%
calling them all through
December and January of 2015.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And his tweet was from the
soon-to-be campaign chairman

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
of the presidential
campaign of Hillary Clinton,

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.110 align:middle line:84%
and leaving as an advisor
to the current president--

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.330 align:middle line:90%
this is high level stuff, folks.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.550 align:middle line:84%
His tweet was my
biggest regret of 2014

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:84%
is, once again, not getting
hashtag disclosure of the UFO

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.960 align:middle line:90%
files.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Careful tweet, no Q&A, and
then it went from there.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.788 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:24:02.788 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew, because
it was all being

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
done behind the
scenes in Washington.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And my job was to
get that done, not

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to go out and tell
everybody I'm doing it.

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.600 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.590 align:middle line:90%
I was happy as hell.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that was happening

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.930 align:middle line:90%
was exactly what we expected.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.013 align:middle line:84%
We thought maybe
the story would blow

00:24:23.013 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Obama
administration would

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:84%
be forced to cut a deal
with the White House--

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with the
Pentagon and disclose.

00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And we'd get it
then, no problemo.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.470 align:middle line:84%
But she was able to
work her way through.

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.013 align:middle line:90%
Podesta is a very smart guy.

00:24:34.013 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And it looked like
she was going to take

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
the White House, in
which case the press was

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.340 align:middle line:90%
going to be all over.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.590 align:middle line:84%
400 stories, nine or 11
times they talked about it

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:43.390 align:middle line:90%
in the campaign?

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:44.620 align:middle line:84%
She takes the White
House, and the press

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.287 align:middle line:84%
is going to not talk
to her about, well,

00:24:46.287 --> 00:24:48.580 align:middle line:90%
what's about this ET thing?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to be the first woman
president and the disclosure

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:55.103 align:middle line:84%
president and there would be
a statue to her on the mall.

00:24:55.103 --> 00:24:57.520 align:middle line:84%
She would go down as one of
the greatest political leaders

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
of all time.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.910 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, she lost.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing
blew sky high.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to make that point.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:90%
It was not an accident.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.733 align:middle line:90%
There was an activist behind it.

00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:12.400 align:middle line:84%
It's one of my greatest
accomplishments.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:90%
It didn't succeed.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.287 align:middle line:90%
So now let's move up.

00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Now that was one of
the longer quotes.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:90%
It won't be that long.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's go up here.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'll explain to
you why this is important.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.815 align:middle line:90%
Just a second-- here we go.

00:25:27.815 --> 00:25:39.310 align:middle line:90%


00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Still working, aren't you?

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And we will start peeling
back along on the first book

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:90%
in a series, "Sekret Machines--

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Chasing Shadows."

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.360 align:middle line:84%
He'll join us for a
couple of segments

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to share stories about the
steep learning curve involved

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in this journey of discovery
these guys have been making.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It starts now.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to mention a
couple of news items quickly.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Cross your fingers,
hope the best

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.330 align:middle line:84%
for a guy who's been my
guest on this program

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:16.070 align:middle line:84%
a couple of times, Robert
Bigelow, space entrepreneur,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I should say, from Las Vegas.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
He founded his company Bigelow
Aerospace back in 1999,

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.960 align:middle line:84%
built it from scratch
with his own money.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And on April 8, he
is scheduled to have

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
one of his spacecraft launched
aboard a SpaceX rocket.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And if all goes
well, it will dock

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.410 align:middle line:10%
with the ISS, the
International Space Station.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.820 align:middle line:84%
It will become an
adjunct to the ISS,

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.100 align:middle line:90%
give them more space up there.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And if things work
out as planned,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
it could lead to very big
things for the Bigelow company

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and for commercial
development of space.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:49.760 align:middle line:84%
NASA just this past
week talking openly

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.832 align:middle line:84%
about a manned lunar base within
a matter of a couple of years.

00:26:53.832 --> 00:26:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And this mission could
play a big part in that.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the same
spacecraft that's

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.000 align:middle line:84%
going to be launched
this week could

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.010 align:middle line:84%
be a model for the habitat
used on the lunar surface.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Now why is that important?

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Robert Bigelow, April
8, NASA is going

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.680 align:middle line:84%
to test his space habitat,
which he spent $390 million

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.760 align:middle line:84%
developing, under a contract
with NASA, since about 2000.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:90%
Bigelow is a billionaire--

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Bigelow Aerospace,
Las Vegas, Nevada.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.333 align:middle line:90%
So that's coming up.

00:27:22.333 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
So remember, this is
March the 27th, 17th--

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.760 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is, March 27th.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And in just a few
days, he's going

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.610 align:middle line:84%
to have the test begin at
the NASA space station.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Keep that in mind, because
it gets interesting later.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Let me move on here.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully this thing is
going to be nice to me.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --her story and
maybe a surprise ending.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm George Knapp, and this
is "Coast to Coast AM."

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Coast to Coast."

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.125 align:middle line:84%
I got a call about
five years ago,

00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was out of
the blue from a guy who

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.470 align:middle line:90%
said his name was Tom DeLonge.

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.055 align:middle line:90%
He had a band called Blink 182.

00:28:08.055 --> 00:28:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I'd heard of
them, of course.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And I'd heard his name.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:90%
That band has sold--

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- close
to 30 million albums.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It remains wildly
popular even now.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Tom was the co-founder, lead
guitarist, and vocalist.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And about 10 years ago,
sort of as a side project,

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:84%
he co-founded another band
called Angels and Airwaves.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.920 align:middle line:90%
It's also been very successful.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.870 align:middle line:84%
But his passion all this time,
through much of his life,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.220 align:middle line:90%
has been UFOs.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And the topic of aliens and UFOs
would pop up in his song lyrics

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:90%
now and then.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I think some of his fans
probably would groan about it.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
It drove them crazy
from time to time.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.820 align:middle line:84%
After Tom it called me that
first time to talk about UFOs,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.460 align:middle line:84%
we continued our
communications over the years.

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:51.490 align:middle line:84%
He joined me on this
program a couple of times.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And then allowed me
sort of a front row

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:90%
seat to what he's been doing.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
About a year ago, his life
took a very dramatic turn.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:84%
He announced he's
leaving Blink 182, which

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.930 align:middle line:84%
caused a furor with his
hardcore fans, of course.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Said he was going to refocus
his professional life,

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:11.980 align:middle line:84%
the working umbrella
title, Sekret Machines,

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.520 align:middle line:84%
an ambitious multi-platform
effort-- films, documentaries,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.650 align:middle line:90%
books-- fiction and nonfiction.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about all those.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about the unexpected turn

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.770 align:middle line:84%
that things took for Tom,
something truly unusual that

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.690 align:middle line:84%
happened along the
way, the contacts

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.950 align:middle line:84%
he made in the UFO field that
are absolutely unprecedented.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.243 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to the
program, Tom DeLonge.

00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:90%
Tom, good to have you.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you?

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope I didn't build
it up too much there.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.132 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was
listening to that intro.

00:29:41.132 --> 00:29:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, my
god, I sound amazing.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting here
kind of going, oh,

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.070 align:middle line:84%
they're all going to figure
me out pretty soon, that I'm--

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.410 align:middle line:90%
--a company called To The Stars.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And what we're doing is--

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I jumped ahead.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.100 align:middle line:84%
>> --kind of communicating
large themes and ideas

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:84%
in what's called--
is transmedia,

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.100 align:middle line:84%
where you do multi-platform
releases on a subject.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's no different
than what you

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
see on your big Marvel
or DC Comics movies

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:90%
or stuff that Disney does.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Even "Star Wars",
where it's a franchise,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.273 align:middle line:84%
it's an idea that
lasts for many years.

00:30:10.273 --> 00:30:11.440 align:middle line:90%
And they do a lot of movies.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They'll do animations.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:90%
They'll do books or whatever.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Sekret Machines is like that.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
All of the releases I'm doing
have a piece of music with it.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
But I was more
interested in things

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.790 align:middle line:84%
that are very challenging and
things that are ambitious.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't do well doing the same
thing over and over again.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not engaged
cerebrally, I kind of feel

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.950 align:middle line:84%
like I'm dying a
slow little death.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So I definitely put a lot
on my plate this time.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The Sekret Machines project,
this idea of doing the books,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.860 align:middle line:90%
it goes back a long ways.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Well before the developments,
he was into that.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's that idea of
this multimedia platform

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is what he eventually
tries to contact

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the military intelligence
complex about.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens next is--
and this is a long segment.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.490 align:middle line:90%
But this is really important.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:06.960 align:middle line:90%
It didn't seem important then.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
This is March 27, 2016.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm hearing this.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm going, wow, I
can't believe this.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.870 align:middle line:90%
This isn't possible.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Later, I said, yeah,
it is possible.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.750 align:middle line:84%
But again, I didn't fully
grasp the implications.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.277 align:middle line:84%
Because it was
2016, and my can--

00:31:20.277 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:90%
I cannot say my candidate.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't vote for her.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, Hillary
Clinton was probably

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:90%
going to win.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.870 align:middle line:90%
Everything looked just great.

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm ecstatic.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.125 align:middle line:84%
He's doing his
thing, no big deal.

00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:27.925 align:middle line:90%
Ha ha.

00:31:27.925 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, it didn't work
out that way at all.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And so now this segment
here if you listen carefully

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.750 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
good stuff here.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:90%
And then I'll comment on it.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Let's see 3206.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Sorry I'm not faster with this.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, this thing keeps--

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.900 align:middle line:90%
no, that's not it.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.355 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that.

00:32:01.355 --> 00:32:07.660 align:middle line:90%


00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Go back again.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:13.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> --is and where it's
from and what it's doing,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
a lot of this book is laying
the foundation for even bigger

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:middle line:90%
stuff that's coming on Book 2.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk for a moment
about the political scene.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not endorsing
Hillary Clinton.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm not endorsing John Podesta.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't think you are, either.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.870 align:middle line:90%
I just find it amazing--

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even know if they
could release the UFO files,

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:90%
even if they could find them.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I just find it amazing that
during the heat of a campaign

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.950 align:middle line:90%
that they're talking about it.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere it would seem like
they've done a big focus group

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.590 align:middle line:90%
or something that says--

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> No!

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.150 align:middle line:90%
>> --it's OK.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it doesn't
make any sense.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.775 align:middle line:84%
It just seems like
it's a downer,

00:32:51.775 --> 00:32:54.150 align:middle line:84%
that it could be something
they'd be beaten over the head

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:54.950 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Yet you've had very open
communications with Podesta.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:84%
His interest in this goes
way, way back, as does hers.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:09.450 align:middle line:84%
I think people need to take
very, very, very strong notice

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on when Hillary
Clinton comes on "The Jimmy

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Kimmel Show" like she did
a couple of nights ago

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and says we're going to dig in
and bring out the UFO files,

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.730 align:middle line:90%
quote--

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
"unless it has to do
with national security."

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.390 align:middle line:90%
That was the one caveat.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So she's saying this
needs to come out.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.630 align:middle line:84%
But there might be some things
that's going to hold some of it

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And she's letting you
know with breadcrumbs

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:36.000 align:middle line:84%
here that there are
national security

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.860 align:middle line:90%
issues with this stuff.

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And there are global security
issues with this stuff.

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So her campaign
manager, John Podesta,

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
is a very, very powerful
and important person.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of this
audience knows of him

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
because he tweeted a
few times about UFOs.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.450 align:middle line:84%
One of his famous
tweets last year

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.390 align:middle line:84%
was that his biggest
failure for 2014

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:84%
was not getting the
UFO files released.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
look at who he is.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:07.080 align:middle line:84%
He got President Clinton elected
and was his chief of staff,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
and got Obama elected and
served as his transitional chief

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of staff, and served for the
majority of Obama's tenure

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.730 align:middle line:90%
as his senior advisor.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And now he's the campaign
chairman for Hillary.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So if Hillary wins,
he'll most likely

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.110 align:middle line:90%
be chief of staff for her.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
So you have a guy
that's routinely

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:31.889 align:middle line:84%
getting people elected to the
highest office in the world

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and then staying on to
either run their offense

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.909 align:middle line:90%
or be their senior advisor.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And he's out there talking about
UFOs like it's anything else.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.389 align:middle line:90%
And he is in my docuseries.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And the story there
was I reached out

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and I told him what I was trying
to achieve with this project.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
quiet on the phone.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:90%
he was listening.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of went through
what my objectives were.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.680 align:middle line:90%
And I have my pitch down.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.590 align:middle line:84%
But I'm speaking
very respectfully.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.440 align:middle line:90%
And I'm trying to lay out--

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the first time it
became known that he had been

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.850 align:middle line:90%
dealing with Podesta.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.422 align:middle line:84%
And most people
didn't hear this.

00:35:13.422 --> 00:35:14.880 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know
anything about it.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't learn about the
connection to Podesta and Tom

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:84%
DeLonge until the Wikileaks
emails were released just

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.280 align:middle line:90%
before the election of 2016.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But he did mention
it on the show.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And so in a sense, he
outed this connection.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.160 align:middle line:84%
But the political
scene did not notice.

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, all the reasons
why this needs to happen,

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.930 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't think that I
really got through to him.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And for all I knew,
he thought I was

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:84%
just some crazy
rock star that wants

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.433 align:middle line:90%
to talk about something weird.

00:35:42.433 --> 00:35:43.850 align:middle line:84%
But I knew he was
into this stuff.

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't know
how much or whatever.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So he said call me
in a couple months.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty busy.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see where we're at.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I said cool.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:middle line:90%
I never called him back.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
think he was really

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.710 align:middle line:90%
absorbing what I pitched him.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And then all a sudden,
out of nowhere, I just

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
get this flurry of
emails from his office

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.690 align:middle line:84%
that he wants to be in this,
and I have to come out to DC,

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's a major priority.

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.110 align:middle line:90%
And the rest is history.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:15.760 align:middle line:84%
But I think people
need to understand

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're in a transition
here with this topic

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and that some really big
things are about to happen.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.178 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what I'm
trying to get at here.

00:36:24.178 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I know for some
listeners who just can't stand

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Hillary Clinton, they have
trouble even listening

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:90%
to this part of it.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But just set that stuff
aside for a second,

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and think for a moment
about the significance

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of a major presidential
candidate talking

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:90%
about this issue.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.850 align:middle line:84%
It's like somebody flipped
a light switch or something.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, you have an
issue that's going to tackle

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
cosmology and religion and
scientific breakthroughs that

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:52.360 align:middle line:90%
will seem like magic to people.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Relationships with
countries that we're not

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.710 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have
relationships with,

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:59.530 align:middle line:84%
defense systems that we've
been building secretly

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.250 align:middle line:84%
with enormous amounts of money
for a very long period of time,

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.750 align:middle line:84%
where people, if
they knew about it,

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:06.130 align:middle line:84%
would probably be in
an uproar until they

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.250 align:middle line:90%
knew the reasons why.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And then they would say,
why didn't you tell me?

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.912 align:middle line:90%
I wish I could've helped you.

00:37:09.912 --> 00:37:12.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, the more that I
found out about this stuff,

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and once they started
giving me the information,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I realized that all these
young people are going

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.500 align:middle line:84%
to look at these areas of
our governments and say you

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.730 align:middle line:90%
guys are heroes.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You guys are doing heroic
stuff, incredible stuff.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:27.003 align:middle line:90%
And no one knows about it.

00:37:27.003 --> 00:37:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And you're letting all these
weirdos on the internet

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.120 align:middle line:84%
define you and say it's
all a big conspiracy.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
It's the big, bad, secret
government keeping secrets

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.200 align:middle line:84%
because they're better than us,
or we can't handle the truth,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.720 align:middle line:84%
or they're doing it
for money and to be

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:90%
in control of the world.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Once you understand why they're
keeping their efforts secret

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and what they've
been doing, you will

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:84%
realize that they
need to be empowered

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and they need to be given
every bit of resource

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that they could possibly
need for what they're doing.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to tell
that part of the story.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm-- in

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I'm going to
revisit this again.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.863 align:middle line:84%
You're going to hear
about this again.

00:38:09.863 --> 00:38:13.270 align:middle line:84%
But what you just heard
is at the core of what's

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:84%
going down here and the
reason it's going down.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you caught it.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.620 align:middle line:84%
But the message
that Tom was trying

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.290 align:middle line:84%
to bring to the military
intelligence complex,

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.500 align:middle line:84%
which he'll talk about
in a little bit, how

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.680 align:middle line:84%
he went around trying to
get meetings and so forth.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're kind
of pushing him off.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then one day,
all of a sudden,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:33.510 align:middle line:90%
it was, like, let's have a talk.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.610 align:middle line:84%
It's that the
military intelligence

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:90%
complex are the good guys.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They're being trashed
unnecessarily and denigrated

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.260 align:middle line:90%
as being the bad guys.

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But they've been trying
to defend us and do

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.670 align:middle line:90%
the best they can.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And the public
needs to know that.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to get that out to the
public so that they will see.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.350 align:middle line:84%
You guys aren't the
evil guys, the ones that

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:90%
are keeping it all from us.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.210 align:middle line:90%
In other words, PR--

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.190 align:middle line:84%
good PR-- for the military
intelligence complex.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They could use some
good public relations.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.930 align:middle line:90%
That was the basis for it.

00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:06.767 align:middle line:90%
That's why it happened.

00:39:06.767 --> 00:39:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
even going on today.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.575 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not criticizing.

00:39:10.575 --> 00:39:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm just saying
what's happening.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll go a
little bit further.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.818 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm excited for people to
understand that these are good

00:39:15.818 --> 00:39:18.790 align:middle line:84%
people doing important
work that, thank God,

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:19.900 align:middle line:90%
they were doing it.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what it
makes you wonder is--

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.700 align:middle line:84%
I made the comparison
to somebody

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.580 align:middle line:84%
flipping a light switch--
whether a green light has

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.850 align:middle line:84%
been given to a variety of
people in the government

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that it's OK to start
dribbling stuff out.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are
talking to you.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Someone, somewhere knows those
conversations are under way.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering where,
ultimately, this come from.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Did they have a conference
call and everybody said, OK,

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:90%
now is the time?

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:48.970 align:middle line:90%
Or what do you think about it?

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
it's hard to say.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:54.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that I came in and
brought an idea to the table

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.540 align:middle line:90%
that they don't readily--

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.100 align:middle line:90%
or you know, have.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, I walked
in there with a voice

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that they don't really
have a position that speaks

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.790 align:middle line:90%
to young people the way I do.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
I also walked in
there with a thesis

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.053 align:middle line:84%
on the phenomenon
that is correct

00:40:13.053 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that's totally
different than just

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.730 align:middle line:90%
visitors from another planet.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So when they saw that I actually
knew what I was talking about,

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I think that caught them
a little bit off guard.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I also
said I have a plan

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to do something that
looks like this.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.000 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of laid out the
whole Sekret Machines project.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And they probably thought
that was really interesting.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But when I started
executing, when I actually

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.270 align:middle line:84%
started doing the work and
pulling the people together,

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and getting all these
advisors, and writing

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
the novel, and the
novel being good,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and the documentary being
good, and everything happening

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.930 align:middle line:84%
the way I said it would, I think
I built up an enormous amount

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.440 align:middle line:90%
of trust with these guys.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be
really clear here.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm very respectful.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm very formal about it.

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything's a yes
sir and no sir.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking to guys where
you can count all the stars

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:06.950 align:middle line:90%
on their shoulders--

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And I try to run this like
a real program, the way they

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.220 align:middle line:90%
would want it run.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.410 align:middle line:90%
So everything gets approval.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Everything gets sent over.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.865 align:middle line:84%
And just to give
you guys an idea,

00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I got a call that I was
going to do a big interview

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.030 align:middle line:90%
with "Newsweek" last week.

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.673 align:middle line:90%
And so I did the interview.

00:41:29.673 --> 00:41:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the interview, I

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.950 align:middle line:84%
found out that it
was a fake interview.

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:33.750 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll stop it there.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:40.570 align:middle line:84%
What you take away from that is,
again, and this is important--

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I was respectful.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.580 align:middle line:90%


00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.830 align:middle line:90%
I treated them with respect--

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.915 align:middle line:84%
wholly appropriate
for what he was doing.

00:41:49.915 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when he
says Sekret Machines,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that was the name
of the first book.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.288 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of
a catchall phrase

00:41:55.288 --> 00:41:57.580 align:middle line:84%
for the entire multimedia
project that was in his head.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.310 align:middle line:84%
That's not the role
of the activist.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:08.040 align:middle line:84%
The activist role is not
to get before the power

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.470 align:middle line:90%
and tell them--

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.263 align:middle line:84%
wonderful, be very
respectful, and all of that.

00:42:13.263 --> 00:42:14.680 align:middle line:84%
The activist role
is to push them.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.520 align:middle line:90%


00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:24.487 align:middle line:84%
And like in war, where it's
the young men and women

00:42:24.487 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:84%
and the journalists who are
out there on the battlefield

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.310 align:middle line:84%
getting their heads blown
off while the entertainment

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:34.630 align:middle line:84%
people and the politicians are
back home quite comfortable,

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in activism, it's the activists
that are up on the bridge

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.380 align:middle line:84%
getting bit by German shepherds
and hosed down with fire hoses

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:45.490 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:49.870 align:middle line:84%
The entertainment industry and
the politicians are not there.

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Our job is to get dog
bites, then the hoses.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.380 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it works.

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.110 align:middle line:90%


00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:02.240 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't heard from
anybody in the Stars team.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't heard
from George Knapp.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And why that matters--

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:10.580 align:middle line:90%
it's not my ego, I assure you.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.670 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that of
those 400 articles that

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:20.050 align:middle line:84%
were written about the Hillary
Clinton-Podesta-ET connection

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.500 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of a $4 billion
presidential campaign, one

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.140 align:middle line:84%
of the most bizarre in
history, the most heavily

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.900 align:middle line:84%
covered in history, 130 of them
heard me and Paradigm Research

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Group.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
I was in the articles, quoted,
including "The New York Times."

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.410 align:middle line:84%
And in the entire
two year campaign,

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I never received a single call
from a single television show

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.420 align:middle line:90%
to comment.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk to the
political activists

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:56.082 align:middle line:84%
because they know
the questions to ask.

00:43:56.082 --> 00:43:59.150 align:middle line:90%
They can't be bought.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.660 align:middle line:90%
They can't be used so easily.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.820 align:middle line:84%
It's best to stay
away from them,

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:05.585 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a
journalist, whether you're

00:44:05.585 --> 00:44:08.380 align:middle line:84%
a member of the Pentagon
or whatever else.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we need something
like what Tom is doing.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:12.750 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:14.640 align:middle line:84%
There's no way they're
going to buy my stuff,

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.260 align:middle line:84%
walking in and saying
yes, sir, yes, sir.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
something for you guys.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not!

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And they would.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.952 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to, right?

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:24.910 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to get information
out to the people.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:26.490 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to change
the paradigm.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was willing to be on
their level and talk to them

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and be nice and
respectful and do

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.210 align:middle line:90%
what he said he wanted to do.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:90%
You need both of these things.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And I say this because--

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:90%
I'll be right with you--

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.260 align:middle line:84%
is because To The Stars
Academy has been heavily hit.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:42.260 align:middle line:90%
They've been criticized.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:90%
They've been ridiculed.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.550 align:middle line:84%
They've got all kinds
of conspiracy theories

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:90%
out there about them.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's just internet stuff.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's that lack
of clarity that

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.615 align:middle line:84%
constantly keeps us
going around in circles

00:44:52.615 --> 00:44:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and never getting anywhere.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.030 align:middle line:90%
So I'm trying to be clarifying.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.236 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:57.236 --> 00:45:00.810 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.610 align:middle line:90%
He's made a doc.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:02.877 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't come out yet.

00:45:02.877 --> 00:45:03.960 align:middle line:90%
But John Podesta is in it.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.928 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:45:05.928 --> 00:45:09.864 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:45:09.864 --> 00:45:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:33.850 align:middle line:90%
Actually, it's not the--

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.230 align:middle line:90%
yeah, let me catch that.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:37.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's my view.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.202 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
I do these things

00:45:40.202 --> 00:45:42.410 align:middle line:84%
and say certain things is
because of those two things

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.450 align:middle line:90%
back there called cameras.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Because this is where you
get things on the record.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Let me be clear.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.660 align:middle line:84%
The principal problem--
well, a principal source

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:84%
of our dilemmas
today do not come

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:04.770 align:middle line:84%
from the Pentagon, or the
CIA, or the NSA, or the Army,

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force, the
Marines, or the Navy.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:12.870 align:middle line:84%
They come from our political
class that runs them.

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:90%
They serve the president.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.360 align:middle line:90%
They serve the White House.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They are employed by
the executive branch.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The president is the boss,
whether it's Johnson or Ford,

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.460 align:middle line:90%
whether it's Bush.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And the political
class, certainly

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:30.370 align:middle line:84%
since 1955 in this country,
has abused the holy hell out

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.925 align:middle line:90%
of our military.

00:46:32.925 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The military
doesn't declare war.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.700 align:middle line:84%
The military doesn't
go off to Vietnam

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.810 align:middle line:84%
unless the president tells
them to go to Vietnam.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:44.542 align:middle line:84%
And so you have the
military defense community,

00:46:44.542 --> 00:46:46.750 align:middle line:84%
whose job was to protect us
against the Soviet threat

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.870 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear war, which is
a pretty serious matter,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and also was dealing with the
ET issue at the same time.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.818 align:middle line:84%
It's just a pretty
serious matter.

00:46:55.818 --> 00:46:58.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically doing
what they're supposed to do.

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.440 align:middle line:84%
The problem is our
political class

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:03.980 align:middle line:84%
has used them all
of the time to serve

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.710 align:middle line:90%
their psychopathic agendas.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.940 align:middle line:90%
They lie in Vietnam.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:08.745 align:middle line:90%
They lie in Iraq.

00:47:08.745 --> 00:47:11.120 align:middle line:84%
They lie about surveillance,
and on and on and on and on.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:14.713 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the military class
gets so disgusted with them

00:47:14.713 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that they said you
guys are crazy.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they started pulling
programs out from under them

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.180 align:middle line:90%
and taking them totally black.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Which is not good, because
that raises the possibility

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.510 align:middle line:84%
the military class
is going to start

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.620 align:middle line:90%
abusing the power of secrecy.

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.830 align:middle line:90%
And to some degree, they have.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But the fundamental dysfunction
is our political class.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:84%
We have one of the
loyalest militaries

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:90%
the world has ever seen.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:43.820 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.640 align:middle line:84%
There are people that
believe in that--

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that the hidden
government-- they

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.600 align:middle line:84%
view the military intelligence
complex as another government

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.410 align:middle line:90%
running things.

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:90%
No, that's not it.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.040 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.470 align:middle line:84%
By taking things black, by
pulling the ET issue out

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
from the presidency
and the Congress

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.760 align:middle line:84%
and oversight, that
simply making it easier

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.898 align:middle line:90%
for them to do their thing.

00:48:16.898 --> 00:48:18.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't got a member
of Congress on their ass.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
media on their ass.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.880 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
president calling them up.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.470 align:middle line:84%
That's not running
the government.

00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:25.840 align:middle line:84%
That's simply make it easy
to run their programs.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's why we
have black budgets.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You see the black
budget is designed

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:39.150 align:middle line:84%
so that the Congress is able
to vote money for something

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.670 align:middle line:84%
without knowing
specifically what it's for.

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:44.670 align:middle line:84%
But certain key members,
like the Gang of Eight,

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:46.380 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to get
briefed about that.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And a certain
limited number know

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.380 align:middle line:90%
what the money is going for.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But things have gotten to the
point, and the amount of money

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.710 align:middle line:90%
that is going through, that--

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.020 align:middle line:84%
these poor people in
Congress have no idea

00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.880 align:middle line:90%
what the hell they're doing.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can have a
black program here.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:02.430 align:middle line:90%
You get it in.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.318 align:middle line:84%
The head of intel
committee knows that.

00:49:04.318 --> 00:49:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And then boom, the money is in.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And then it goes over here.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.270 align:middle line:90%
They're moving stuff all around.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:10.890 align:middle line:84%
The day before
9/11, as you know,

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Rumsfeld came out
and said, you know--

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and this was rather remarkable
for a Secretary of Defense

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.600 align:middle line:84%
to publicly announce that
based on a preliminary audit,

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.880 align:middle line:84%
they've not been able
to do a full audit,

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.400 align:middle line:84%
they can't account
for $2 trillion.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Now that's not conspiracy stuff.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.410 align:middle line:90%
That's actually in the news.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And then 9/11 happened the next
day, probably a coincidence.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Since then they've indicated
they've lost even more money.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so again, the deep state
is a recent corrupted meme.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not doing anybody any good.

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.110 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:49.595 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want
you to interrupt.

00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:52.505 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:49:52.505 --> 00:50:07.360 align:middle line:90%


00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They really--

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the joke?

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Donald Rumsfeld
lost all that money--

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, Rumsfeld
didn't lose all that money.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:28.020 align:middle line:84%
What he was saying is that
for the previous 60 years,

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.520 align:middle line:84%
after doing some
audit, they're not

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.485 align:middle line:90%
able to account for $2 trillion.

00:50:31.485 --> 00:50:33.360 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean it
got lost the day before.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:36.138 align:middle line:84%
It means that over decades,
their whole systems

00:50:36.138 --> 00:50:37.430 align:middle line:90%
are not particularly effective.

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.690 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And then something
crashed into the building.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.233 align:middle line:84%
The discussion about exactly
what was in those offices

00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:47.650 align:middle line:84%
and exactly to what extent
they affected the audit, that's

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:48.940 align:middle line:90%
a complex discussion.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.560 align:middle line:90%
We can't have it here.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I understand your position.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.137 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's impossible
it isn't a coincidence.

00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:57.970 align:middle line:84%
But I know people that
are doing audits now.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.020 align:middle line:90%
And they'll continue to audit.

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like the audits
were going to stop.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.013 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, recently, they just
announced that, yeah, they're

00:51:03.013 --> 00:51:04.910 align:middle line:90%
missing $4 trillion.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at
the total 9/11 thing,

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.030 align:middle line:84%
it could be that they
saw an opportunity

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to do a let it happen multitask
thing where they could

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:13.600 align:middle line:90%
knock out a bunch of stuff.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all possible.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm not knocking it out.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.263 align:middle line:84%
But believe me, when it comes
to these matters, impossible not

00:51:20.263 --> 00:51:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to have some disagreements
on the particulars.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Because we're talking about
some real complex history.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:25.260 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:90%


00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:32.420 align:middle line:84%
So again, I get back
to the key point,

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and this is my view, as
well, the enemy is not

00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the military
intelligence community.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.210 align:middle line:84%
The enemy is the
political abuse of them,

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:42.670 align:middle line:84%
the inability of the
politicians, because they're

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:45.130 align:middle line:84%
bought and sold, to
properly oversight them,

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:46.630 align:middle line:84%
the inability of
the political class

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.030 align:middle line:90%
to exercise reforms anymore.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.210 align:middle line:90%
And why is it important?

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't elect the
under managers of the DOD.

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.580 align:middle line:84%
You don't elect the generals
in the army and the admirals

00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.510 align:middle line:90%
in the Navy.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:04.570 align:middle line:90%
You elect a political class.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And you-- not you particularly,
this is the general "you"--

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:13.800 align:middle line:84%
all of those people
were elected by us.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And so who was
fundamentally responsible

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:25.580 align:middle line:84%
for the discombobulated,
dysfunctional, corrupt--

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.460 align:middle line:90%
us.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:30.730 align:middle line:84%
We passed all the bills
by our representatives

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.760 align:middle line:84%
to ruin campaign
financing and make

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.070 align:middle line:90%
billionaires ultimate power.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:40.330 align:middle line:84%
We allowed the Congress to give
corporations personhood status.

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.640 align:middle line:90%
And I could go on and on and on.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we either say
it's not our fault,

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:53.430 align:middle line:84%
or the elections were bogus,
or it's all rigged in advance.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And I might believe that
if 90% of us were voting.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But only about 48%
of us are voting.

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Now this is the activist
in me coming out.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.320 align:middle line:84%
But the reason that I'm
getting kind of agitated

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is because of the history
that's happening now.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.153 align:middle line:90%
This is huge.

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.570 align:middle line:84%
This is our
opportunity to maybe--

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT] Right?

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.190 align:middle line:84%
But you actually have to
know how important it is.

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.005 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:22.981 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:53:22.981 --> 00:53:32.921 align:middle line:90%


00:53:32.921 --> 00:53:35.903 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:53:35.903 --> 00:53:37.394 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:37.394 --> 00:53:40.873 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:53:40.873 --> 00:53:42.364 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:42.364 --> 00:53:46.340 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:49.322 align:middle line:90%


00:53:49.322 --> 00:53:51.807 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:53:51.807 --> 00:53:53.298 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:53:53.298 --> 00:53:56.777 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:53:56.777 --> 00:54:23.210 align:middle line:90%


00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:26.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, point number one-- the
number one reason the military

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.950 align:middle line:84%
has felt vulnerable
for the last 70 years

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
is because there's
tens of thousands

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of nuclear weapons in
the hands of a bunch

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.630 align:middle line:84%
of different nations,
and at any time,

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.730 align:middle line:84%
we could have a nuclear war
and blow ourselves all to hell.

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the number one
thing of vulnerability.

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:38.743 align:middle line:84%
As far as the ET issue,
they knew long ago

00:54:38.743 --> 00:54:40.160 align:middle line:84%
that there's not
a damn thing they

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.515 align:middle line:90%
can do about the ETs, period.

00:54:42.515 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want to
feel vulnerable, fine,

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:90%
but nothing you can do about it.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Have the courage to change what
you can, and then what is the--

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.250 align:middle line:90%
to accept what you can't change?

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's not about vulnerability.

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Over the years in various
ways, if you know,

00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:59.840 align:middle line:84%
you go sift through
it all, you find

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:01.580 align:middle line:84%
that the government
or the military

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:03.230 align:middle line:84%
has said on a
number of occasions,

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:04.850 align:middle line:90%
they don't pose a threat.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:90%
Even UK has said that, right?

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they sort of
do that is because they do

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:84%
know there's people out here
getting a little anxious,

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.412 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:55:11.412 --> 00:55:13.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist, but
they don't pose a threat.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.828 align:middle line:84%
Whatever that is
that doesn't exist

00:55:14.828 --> 00:55:17.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't pose a threat--
they say that all the time.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Look-- there is nothing
they can do about the ETs.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:21.600 align:middle line:84%
They could destroy us
anytime they want to.

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't even
have to break a sweat.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:27.040 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
people need to understand.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.570 align:middle line:84%
There are people out there
that think-- you know,

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:29.950 align:middle line:84%
they've seen some
"Star Wars" movies,

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and they've seen all
these sci-fi movies,

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and they see us taking
our ships up there,

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.378 align:middle line:84%
and they all shoot each other
like in a gunfight with laser

00:55:35.378 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
beams from like a
few yards away--

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.800 align:middle line:90%
this is utter crap, right?

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.192 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:41.192 --> 00:55:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The technologies they
have and the ability they

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:48.920 align:middle line:84%
have, we wouldn't last a week,
and so we are at their mercy.

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.770 align:middle line:84%
The problem we have is not
what they might do to us,

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:54.630 align:middle line:84%
but what we are
doing to ourselves.

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:55.430 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:55.430 --> 00:56:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:07.030 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:14.732 align:middle line:90%


00:56:14.732 --> 00:56:16.815 align:middle line:84%
Again, a cabal is a term
that means nothing to me.

00:56:16.815 --> 00:56:18.052 align:middle line:90%
It's just a term.

00:56:18.052 --> 00:56:19.510 align:middle line:84%
These are terms
that get into play.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:20.968 align:middle line:84%
They're called
memes, and they help

00:56:20.968 --> 00:56:22.902 align:middle line:84%
people to sort of
coalesce ideas around,

00:56:22.902 --> 00:56:23.985 align:middle line:90%
but they're never defined.

00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.670 align:middle line:90%
Can any--

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:42.750 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:49.620 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:54.760 align:middle line:84%
At any given time, there
are countless numbers

00:56:54.760 --> 00:57:00.310 align:middle line:84%
of power groupings trying to do
stuff, trying to get their way,

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.670 align:middle line:90%
trying to move things around.

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You've got all kinds of
various corporation groups

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.442 align:middle line:90%
where it's farm or oil.

00:57:07.442 --> 00:57:08.650 align:middle line:90%
You've got bankers in Europe.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:10.540 align:middle line:84%
You've got bankers
the United States.

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're all pushing
in different directions.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And they've got power, and they
can kind of make things happen.

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And people, like us-- and
I'm definitely one of them--

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:24.392 align:middle line:84%
who live day to day, see that
and they go, we're helpless.

00:57:24.392 --> 00:57:25.600 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we can't do anything.

00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.930 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
have the influence

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.260 align:middle line:90%
that these power centers have.

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.240 align:middle line:90%
And we feel helpless.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.830 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But to truly understand
the complexity

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:40.930 align:middle line:84%
of this geopolitical
dynamic, that's a PhD--

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.093 align:middle line:90%
maybe two.

00:57:42.093 --> 00:57:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, we all have
to make a living, don't we?

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:47.210 align:middle line:90%
We have to pay the bills.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And so there are those
that come along and try

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.830 align:middle line:90%
to make it real simple for you.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Bring all this complexity--
it's the Illuminati.

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They live in Europe somewhere,
and they control everything.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.990 align:middle line:90%
And it just makes it simple.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Now is that a bad thing?

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.190 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
it's a good thing.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:06.175 align:middle line:90%
You've got that's what it is.

00:58:06.175 --> 00:58:06.975 align:middle line:90%
It's simple.

00:58:06.975 --> 00:58:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Go about your life.

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Do what you gotta do.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a bad thing
because it's just not true.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there is all these
centers out there doing stuff,

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:17.770 align:middle line:84%
and then the things that they're
doing are hurting people,

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:18.820 align:middle line:84%
but the people that
are getting hurt

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.278 align:middle line:84%
are over there looking for the
Illuminati and Transylvania.

00:58:21.278 --> 00:58:24.360 align:middle line:90%
They love it, right?

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The world's complicated, but
that's why you have government.

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have
institutions and NGOs.

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.760 align:middle line:84%
If they're run by competent
people, credible people,

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the power of them together,
it can deal with this stuff.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto comes along and tries
to basically poison all of us

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:49.530 align:middle line:84%
with a herbicide that is
cancerous, but helps them sell,

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:53.645 align:middle line:84%
and then gets into Terminator
seeds and all that stuff.

00:58:53.645 --> 00:58:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The government
comes up and says,

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:58.295 align:middle line:84%
no, but our dysfunctional
comes up and says,

00:58:58.295 --> 00:58:59.670 align:middle line:84%
how much are you
going to pay me?

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:02.400 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the reason you're
seeing these memes evolve

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.410 align:middle line:84%
is because the
organizations that

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.460 align:middle line:84%
are designed to press back
against the influences

00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:16.170 align:middle line:84%
of people that want what
they want are not doing that.

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And we're sitting here going,
what are we going to do?

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.800 align:middle line:90%
We're screwed.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
these memes develop.

00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And not much I can do about
that-- is simply tell you

00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:27.950 align:middle line:90%
what I think, all right?

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Most of the stuff on the
internet is bull, OK?

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:34.490 align:middle line:90%
But a lot of it's great.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And the number one skill
anybody can have in this world--

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:39.198 align:middle line:84%
and if you have a kid, start
teaching them at about 3

00:59:39.198 --> 00:59:40.580 align:middle line:90%
and 1/2--

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:43.420 align:middle line:84%
is how do you figure
out what's bull

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and what's real because if
you can't tell the difference,

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:48.140 align:middle line:90%
you're lost.

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:49.900 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's move on.

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.110 align:middle line:90%
See, this is a workshop.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't you say this
is not a lecture?

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I want
to do here is I'm

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.737 align:middle line:84%
going to go over here and
move along a little further.

00:59:59.737 --> 01:00:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, at least, I thought I was.

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.220 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.345 align:middle line:90%
OK, we're going to go here.

01:00:04.345 --> 01:00:07.840 align:middle line:90%


01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The song called "Whole
Life," recorded in 2003,

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.000 align:middle line:84%
has never been released
on a Paul McCartney album.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.850 align:middle line:84%
That's McCartney collaborating
with guitarist Dave Stewart

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:16.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Eurythmics.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Great song.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:20.700 align:middle line:84%
We're talking with musician,
vocalist Tom DeLonge.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And let's get down to
the brass tacks though.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.450 align:middle line:84%
You had this project
sort of in mind

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.800 align:middle line:84%
before you met
these guys, right?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I did.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
I didn't quite know how I was
going to get the support that I

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.480 align:middle line:90%
wanted.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I had ideas of how to start.

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I'm the kind of
guy that's always sniffed out--

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:43.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's important.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what
George is saying,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:48.800 align:middle line:84%
look, he already had these ideas
in his head before he met them.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
These guys didn't
pitch this to him.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.020 align:middle line:90%
He pitched it to them.

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been thinking
about it for a long time.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And he has the money to
fly to some meeting that's

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
open to the public,
or some defense guys,

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.410 align:middle line:90%
or high-level people might be.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.118 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd go to
the meeting, and then

01:01:05.118 --> 01:01:08.320 align:middle line:84%
he kind of sidle up to them
and say, hi, I'm Tom DeLonge.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.695 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe, a kind
of nice to meet you.

01:01:10.695 --> 01:01:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And he kept doing it.

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
He's like working it,
working it, working it.

01:01:13.610 --> 01:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
What Tom did not know
is that sometime in 2015

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
with Hillary Clinton way
ahead to be president,

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and she and her team talking
ETs all over the place,

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
the guys inside realize we
have got to move on this.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.010 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get
out ahead of this.

01:01:32.010 --> 01:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they basically
came to the same conclusion

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that Tom did, but he
wouldn't have known that.

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And so at some point
you'll learn later,

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
he suddenly gets
invited to talk.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And it goes, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
And if that's all you knew--

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.670 align:middle line:84%
if all you knew was that a
rock guy with a high school

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:53.710 align:middle line:84%
education and ADDH, who says
you know every four words,

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
is having meetings with the
top people in the Pentagon

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and the CIA, you would
say you would not even

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:02.120 align:middle line:90%
put that in a novel.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And it happened because a young
guy who knew a lot about ETs

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.120 align:middle line:84%
with an idea and the military--
and a substantial group

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
inside the military
intelligence complex

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
pretty much had the same idea at
the same time and got together.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
Tom was important

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.230 align:middle line:84%
is that they wanted to do
what they wanted to do,

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
but one of them
could not lead it.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.720 align:middle line:84%
If the To The Stars
Academy had come out

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and the CEO was a 30-year
counterintelligence

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
guy from the CIA, how
do you think the public

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.880 align:middle line:90%
would have received it, right?

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Uh, I don't think so.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead, the CEO is a really
cool skateboarding millennial

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
with a huge population and
a massive Twitter following.

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:46.530 align:middle line:90%
And hes got a multimedia thing.

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.335 align:middle line:84%
He's writing books and stuff,
and everything is all cool.

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
historical things.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a fluke, and
yet it's amazing.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And it may be what
turns the tide.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
OK, now, let me move on here.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Let me see how much of this
we can do because this--

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning that my ad
libbing abilities are simply

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.200 align:middle line:90%
beyond my control.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:12.100 align:middle line:90%
All right, let's see.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Here, he goes into--

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
this is the-- you know,
you got to hear this

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
because this basically
says how this happened.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And you know, he's telling
it, I think, pretty straight.

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And I hope you'll see just how
freakin' remarkable this is.

01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
Here we go.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:39.760 align:middle line:90%


01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:40.805 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we are.

01:03:40.805 --> 01:03:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
>> After that when I sort
of did it the way, you know,

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that these guys treat it, which
is it is a national and global

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.230 align:middle line:90%
security issue.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:56.062 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about the process
of how you sort of pierced

01:03:56.062 --> 01:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
the veil because that's what
people are going to have

01:03:58.270 --> 01:03:59.230 align:middle line:90%
trouble buying.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
How is this guy-- how is it
this rock star guy gains access

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
to this when so many people--

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
senators, and researchers,
and scientists,

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and spooks who've tried
to look for this stuff--

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.180 align:middle line:90%
couldn't find it?

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.790 align:middle line:90%
How do you get the access?

01:04:12.790 --> 01:04:14.450 align:middle line:90%
How do you explain that?

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's preface it.

01:04:16.016 --> 01:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The military intelligence
complex stonewalled Clinton,

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:25.410 align:middle line:84%
stonewalled Carter,
stonewalled Obama, right?

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Gave a little
information to Nixon.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:30.580 align:middle line:90%
He got a briefing, right?

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Stonewalled the media.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:34.715 align:middle line:84%
Lied, came up with four
explanations for Roswell,

01:04:34.715 --> 01:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and on, and on, and
on, and on, and on,

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.900 align:middle line:90%
and on for years and decades.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.190 align:middle line:90%
But this guy, they let in.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.360 align:middle line:90%
You see, something happened.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've told you
what I think happened.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a political
development that

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.965 align:middle line:84%
finally forced a lot of
people inside the military

01:04:52.965 --> 01:04:55.090 align:middle line:84%
intelligence complex who
favored disclosure and had

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
been for a long time to say,
we no longer can just sit here.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:58.930 align:middle line:90%
We've got to take some action.

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:00.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, here we go.

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, I might as
well just tell you the story.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
So the way the first--

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, it spells
this out a little bit

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
in the foreword to the book,
but I had an opportunity

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
to go to an event.

01:05:11.290 --> 01:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
So the most classified and
the most advanced group

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of engineers and
scientists that work

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.640 align:middle line:84%
within the military
industrial complex

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.370 align:middle line:90%
work under one specific group.

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:29.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very quiet group.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But for the very
first time, they

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:36.395 align:middle line:84%
were doing an event where
family members can come and not

01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:38.770 align:middle line:84%
go in the building, but at
least celebrate in the parking

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
lot what their loved ones
do during the day, you know.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And they asked me, you
know, would you come up?

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And because I knew this
one individual that

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.150 align:middle line:90%
told me to be really careful.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, he goes,
hey, look, this

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is a way for you to come
up and see a little bit

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:54.053 align:middle line:90%
about what we're doing.

01:05:54.053 --> 01:05:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, my
god, I would love to.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, do you want
to come and introduce

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
the head of the
company to the crowd?

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I will if I get to
sit with them for five minutes.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:06.083 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I said that.

01:06:06.083 --> 01:06:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that that
was an opportunity

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
that guys like me
would kill because I

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
knew exactly who this
group of engineers were.

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly what
they do, you know.

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So the head guy--
are you kidding me?

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let me lock me in
a room with this dude.

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:25.047 align:middle line:90%
And so I got that opportunity.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.130 align:middle line:84%
I went up and I did the
introduction to the crowd,

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and then I got the five
minutes to sit down alone

01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:33.190 align:middle line:84%
and say whatever it
is I wanted to say.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:37.480 align:middle line:84%
So at that time, I didn't say
anything about this subject.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I just said, hey, I have
an idea for a project.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And this project, I think
if it's done correctly,

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:47.590 align:middle line:84%
will reverse the cynicism that
people have about government

01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
and what people
have about the, you

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:52.300 align:middle line:84%
know, frankly, the military
industrial complex.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I think that if I
do this, you know,

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
places like this and other
arms of the government

01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
would be happy that
it got communicated.

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't bring up
anything that was, you know--

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> You didn't mention UFOs.

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.308 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't mention UFOs.

01:07:08.308 --> 01:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't even do that
because you'll get

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:11.470 align:middle line:90%
kicked right out of the door.

01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:13.573 align:middle line:90%
So he goes, OK, that's great.

01:07:13.573 --> 01:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, can I come
up in a couple of weeks

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and tell you more about it?

01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.720 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of weeks go
by, then I come back up.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
I go through four
layers of security.

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I go through machine guns--
guys with machine guns--

01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:26.957 align:middle line:84%
and then I get escorted into a
very specific building that's

01:07:26.957 --> 01:07:28.040 align:middle line:90%
with a bunch of buildings.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is somewhere out in the
middle of the desert somewhere.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I go through two
layers of electronic code entry

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.410 align:middle line:90%
systems.

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And then you hear the locks go.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, they make their
sounds and the doors open up.

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm in a hallway.

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And that hallway has speakers
lining the ceiling just playing

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
white noise, kind
of like TV static.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's there so you don't
hear anybody's conversations.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And the hallway also
has a series of doors.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And all the doors have kind of
like those big rotary locks,

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:58.150 align:middle line:90%
like a safe lock on them.

01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So we go through that
hallway, and then

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.200 align:middle line:84%
they just twisted the
knobs on the doors,

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and then you hear the big
sound and that door opens up.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm in the
center of the building

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:11.620 align:middle line:84%
where the top three
engineers work

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.118 align:middle line:90%
with the head of the company.

01:08:14.118 --> 01:08:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I walk in and
they're sitting there.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:18.819 align:middle line:84%
And they're ready for what
it is I wanted to pitch them.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I'm nervously
trying to figure out

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:22.810 align:middle line:90%
what I'm going to say.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that--
you know, I had

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.779 align:middle line:84%
no plan for even bringing
up UFOs then either.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:30.290 align:middle line:90%
I was smarter than that.

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:33.607 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking and one
person apparently did

01:08:33.607 --> 01:08:35.649 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of research on me
and knew that I was all

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:36.560 align:middle line:90%
into the subject.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:41.029 align:middle line:84%
So halfway through the
conversation, this person says,

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:43.930 align:middle line:84%
so what about all the conspiracy
stuff that you're into?

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And just so now,
I'm being eyeballed

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
by three very important
people and I'm just totally

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:49.210 align:middle line:90%
got caught.

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I'm
like, oh my god,

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:51.643 align:middle line:90%
what am I going to do right now?

01:08:51.643 --> 01:08:53.560 align:middle line:84%
So I tried to talk
my way out of it.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And then in comes the head
of the company-- the big,

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:57.819 align:middle line:90%
big dude--

01:08:57.819 --> 01:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
and kind of saves the moment,
but at the same time, you know,

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.200 align:middle line:84%
he got introduced to
the conversation right

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:06.410 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I
said, you know, you

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
come in at a very interesting
part of the conversation.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
This person brought up, you
know, the whole UFO issue

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:19.010 align:middle line:90%
with me.

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know
that I don't plan on,

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:24.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, treating
that disrespectfully

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:25.460 align:middle line:90%
with this project.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And now, I got interrupted.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And the head guy says, we cannot
be involved with anything that

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:35.330 align:middle line:84%
has anything to do
with that subject,

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
especially since there has
been absolutely no evidence

01:09:39.310 --> 01:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
whatsoever that it exists.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So bam, I'm just
cut off right there.

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.689 align:middle line:90%
And now, my heart's racing.

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what do I do?

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So the only thing that I can
think of at the moment is I

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
said, well, Edgar
Allen Mitchell--

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.240 align:middle line:84%
the sixth man to
walk on the moon--

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.900 align:middle line:84%
is out telling all the
young people of the world

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.700 align:middle line:90%
that this is real.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have a credibility
issue that we have to attack,

01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:02.120 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have to
attack it here or now

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.747 align:middle line:90%
and we could talk this through.

01:10:03.747 --> 01:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just something
that young people think,

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to know a little
bit more about my project.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.667 align:middle line:90%
And so I got my way through.

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I was like, oh, my
god, I'm still here.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.080 align:middle line:90%
So they said, OK, continue.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So that specific meeting ended,
and then I just said, you know,

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:18.550 align:middle line:90%
hell with it.

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, sir, can I speak to
you for five minutes alone?

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the Tom that
even my old band

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
members know-- you know,
just go for something.

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the punk rock
kid inside of me, right?

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:30.398 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, sure.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so the other people
kind of look at me weird.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
OK, so we leave?

01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of looked
at them, so they did.

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:38.407 align:middle line:84%
So they stood up
and I shut the door.

01:10:38.407 --> 01:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm in the middle
of all these different layers

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
of security, and I'm
sitting with this person,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.950 align:middle line:90%
and I just go for broke.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.400 align:middle line:84%
I just go-- this is
exactly what I said.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
understand something.

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:51.252 align:middle line:84%
And I sit down two
feet in front of him

01:10:51.252 --> 01:10:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and he's staring
at me in his suit.

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I go, I understand the
national security implications

01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:57.530 align:middle line:90%
about what I'm about to say.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I am not naive to the topic.

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:04.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think if you
hear me out, you're

01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:08.693 align:middle line:84%
going to see that there's merit
in what I'm about to propose.

01:11:08.693 --> 01:11:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, well, what
topic are you talking about?

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:12.240 align:middle line:90%
And I go, UFOs, sir.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what I
want to try and do.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And so then I just laid out this
entire secret machine's project

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.730 align:middle line:90%
idea.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm
going to send in--

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.510 align:middle line:84%
I said, but over
the past 30 years,

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.370 align:middle line:84%
there's been a program to
indoctrinate people to the idea

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that this might be
real, but the problem

01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
is all the young adults of the
world, they use the internet.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:33.090 align:middle line:90%
They have iPhones.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
They talk to each other much
quicker than people ever have,

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
so this program that everyone's
been following from the '50s

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:40.560 align:middle line:90%
is far outdated.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.610 align:middle line:90%
It's antiquated.

01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:42.822 align:middle line:90%
People have surpassed it.

01:11:42.822 --> 01:11:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And now, they don't
trust you guys.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.530 align:middle line:90%
Now, they don't like you guys.

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, they graduate from MIT and
they want to work for Elon Musk

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and they don't
want to work here.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Help me help you guys.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.195 align:middle line:84%
And then he stops me
because I said, frankly,

01:11:56.195 --> 01:11:57.570 align:middle line:84%
there's been some
bad things that

01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:59.730 align:middle line:84%
have happened for the past
30 years on the subject.

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And he stops me.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.113 align:middle line:84%
And I'm kind of going, OK,
so now, I'm in trouble.

01:12:03.113 --> 01:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I just went right
into this stuff.

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:05.790 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.080 align:middle line:90%
And he looks at me.

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And he takes a breath and he
goes, what kind of bad things

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.450 align:middle line:84%
has the government
done with this subject?

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Very, very calm and staring
me straight in the eyes.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I came up with
a couple of things

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.400 align:middle line:90%
that I can't say here.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you
allow me to do this--

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.730 align:middle line:90%
what I'm trying to do--

01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:29.850 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to ask
you for some help.

01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:31.470 align:middle line:90%
I need advisors.

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I need people to
help guide me so I

01:12:34.050 --> 01:12:35.790 align:middle line:90%
don't keep misinforming people.

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%
I will not do that anymore.

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.125 align:middle line:90%
We need to tell the truth.

01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
said at the time?

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.210 align:middle line:84%
I said, you've got to picture
those little chickens running

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
across the road and
someone's guiding them.

01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm all, I'm that little
chicken and I'm racing,

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
but I don't want to get hit by
a car along the way, you know.

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.950 align:middle line:90%
But it was no joke.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.490 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing to
laugh at during this time.

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So I said, I'm going
to send you something.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I want you to read it.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And please, if you find
anything about it good,

01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
if there's any kind of
merit in this at all,

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
just respond any way
you can because I

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't think you could respond
in an email or anything.

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
He goes, OK, thank you for that,
and then the meeting was done.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was the
nonfiction books that we've

01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:17.700 align:middle line:84%
been working on right next
to the seeker machines

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
novel and parallel has--

01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:23.740 align:middle line:84%
it's a thesis of
the UFO phenomenon.

01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So I took the prologue to that
thesis and I sent it to him.

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
oh, my god, what did I do?

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:31.950 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't have
sent him an email.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.758 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you
don't send an email.

01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Every email you have with
this group, it has all these,

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
like, government stamps
all over the email

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:45.053 align:middle line:84%
because it goes through DoD
servers and all this stuff.

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But I had no other
way to get it to him.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.610 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

01:13:47.610 --> 01:13:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So I just sat there, and
I didn't hear anything

01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:50.470 align:middle line:90%
for a couple weeks.

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, OK, that
relationship is done.

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:53.790 align:middle line:90%
I fried that thing.

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.440 align:middle line:90%
I went in there talking about--

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.160 align:middle line:84%
I tell people it's like walking
into somebody during World War

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
II, and say, hey, about
that nuclear bomb you're

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
building in secret, you know, I
want to talk to you about that.

01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:06.660 align:middle line:90%
That's basically what I did.

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, two weeks later, I
get this email and it says,

01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
I want you to be
next to the Pentagon

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.090 align:middle line:90%
at this date and this time.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:15.880 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be meeting
somebody from the CIA

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.680 align:middle line:90%
basically.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It said it in a different way,
but I can't say what it said.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.500 align:middle line:90%
And so I was like, oh, my god.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.270 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's working.

01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So I get on a plane
and I fly out to DC.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it gets pretty
sketchy, but it was insane.

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:36.957 align:middle line:90%
So I go to my meeting.

01:14:36.957 --> 01:14:38.790 align:middle line:84%
I had to go to a very
specific location that

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
was within a rock's
throw of the Pentagon.

01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the back of a
room at a certain location.

01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's two guys in suits
waiting at a table for me.

01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So I go and I sit
down at the table.

01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And the person I was talking
to is one of the persons.

01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I think this would
be a good time for you to tell

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:00.313 align:middle line:90%
this person what you told me.

01:15:00.313 --> 01:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there kind of
in my mind, I'm going, well,

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:03.530 align:middle line:90%
what do I say?

01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Do I tell him everything I
told you or some of the things?

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.707 align:middle line:84%
Am I allowed to tell him
that I told you these things?

01:15:08.707 --> 01:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what to say, so I
said, OK, I'll just go for it.

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So I went through
the exact same pitch.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So I talked about
20-some minutes

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
because they were just
eyeballing me like hawks,

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.360 align:middle line:90%
you know.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.498 align:middle line:84%
So at this point,
I just don't know.

01:15:21.498 --> 01:15:23.290 align:middle line:84%
I've never been in
these situations before,

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:25.050 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't know if I was
saying the wrong thing or not,

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but I was just trying
to be very respectful

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.780 align:middle line:90%
and I went through with it.

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.970 align:middle line:90%
And I finished my speech.

01:15:29.970 --> 01:15:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the person is
just staring at me--

01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%
I mean, these squinting eyes.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.780 align:middle line:90%
You know, the beard, the suit--

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, looks exactly
straight out of a movie--

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.270 align:middle line:90%
an espionage movie.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Takes a breath and
goes, things like this

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.300 align:middle line:90%
don't happen at the White House.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.460 align:middle line:90%
They don't happen at the hill.

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:53.850 align:middle line:84%
They happen in places
like this, at tables

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
like this, where a few men get
together and decide to push

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.180 align:middle line:90%
the ball down the field.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And then the meeting was done.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.350 align:middle line:90%
I mean, done, like a movie done.

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So the very next day, I
got sent over to NASA.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm at the highest
levels at NASA.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to
do the same thing

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.350 align:middle line:90%
where I ask everyone to leave.

01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So this one person, I did
the pitch one more time.

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you
need to meet somebody.

01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
So that person flies
out to San Diego.

01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I go to another meeting.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.980 align:middle line:90%
We get on a conference call.

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And this person is a very
important in the military.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I can't say which branch, but
at the highest level of ranks.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
But then after they left
that particular branch

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of the military, they did
something very, very important

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:50.310 align:middle line:90%
for another agency.

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And that person says,
come fly and meet me up

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.450 align:middle line:84%
here in San Francisco
within the next 48 hours.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:16:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So I got on a plane
and I go there.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm sitting
on a NASA Ames--

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
NASA has three divisions.

01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:08.790 align:middle line:84%
There's Ames Research,
JPL, and then just NASA--

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:middle line:84%
the traditional NASA
that everyone knows.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm at Ames Research Center.

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I go through my
whole pitch again.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And this person
stops me and goes,

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know I'm
a skeptic on this stuff.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I
understand that, sir.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I knew you would say that, but
let me just continue and tell

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:27.153 align:middle line:90%
you what I'm trying to do.

01:17:27.153 --> 01:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes later, I
just want you to know,

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:30.870 align:middle line:90%
just I'm a skeptic.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And I go, I know you are.

01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:34.170 align:middle line:90%
You already said that.

01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And I keep talking.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I got
to kind of concluding

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:41.160 align:middle line:84%
what this project would be,
he's just staring at me.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he takes a
deep breath and says,

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:46.090 align:middle line:90%
introduce him to the general.

01:17:46.090 --> 01:17:47.742 align:middle line:84%
And then I was like,
well, who's that?

01:17:47.742 --> 01:17:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're both
just staring at me

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
because there was this guy
that was right next to him--

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.480 align:middle line:90%
a very serious guy.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, on
my email two hours later,

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to somebody that
has changed the entire course

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.060 align:middle line:90%
of this whole project.

01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:06.930 align:middle line:84%
So I get on the phone with
that person that same evening,

01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
and I go through
the same situation.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'm starting to walk
through what I'm trying to do

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.590 align:middle line:90%
and how I plan to do it.

01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And this person goes,
I want you to know

01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a skeptic on this stuff.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.818 align:middle line:84%
And I go, sir, I knew
you would say that,

01:18:22.818 --> 01:18:24.360 align:middle line:84%
but let me explain
a little bit more.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So I walk through it again,
and then the person goes,

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
I just gotta say
it, I'm a skeptic.

01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:33.608 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was verbatim.

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> They all do it, right?

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:35.910 align:middle line:90%
They all did it.

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:36.940 align:middle line:90%
>> They all do it.

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
But on the third time, he goes,
I swore an oath to my country.

01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And I said, sir, I know
you did and I'm not

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:46.990 align:middle line:84%
asking for you to give me
classified information.

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:48.473 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve it.

01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you
understand what

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to do
with this project,

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.065 align:middle line:84%
you may think it
deserves your attention.

01:18:54.065 --> 01:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes,
I'm afraid what

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.480 align:middle line:84%
you might find is a
bunch of men in suits

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%
standing around an elephant.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I was afraid
you were going to say that,

01:19:03.170 --> 01:19:04.800 align:middle line:90%
but can you help me?

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And he says, fly
out and meet me.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:09.895 align:middle line:90%
And that's where--

01:19:09.895 --> 01:19:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That's where things
get interesting.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.187 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where
things get interesting.

01:19:13.187 --> 01:19:14.910 align:middle line:90%
So I fly out.

01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you what,
Tom, we're going to take--

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, believe me,
much more happens,

01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:25.070 align:middle line:84%
but you're starting to get a
feel of how extraordinary this

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:26.280 align:middle line:90%
is.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.520 align:middle line:90%
A couple of comments.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this entire
scenario-- and by the way,

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:35.490 align:middle line:90%
I've got 30 or 40 more clips.

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:36.660 align:middle line:90%
The rest of this story--

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're going
to go on for a while,

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.880 align:middle line:84%
but the rest of the story
is going to be Monday night.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.285 align:middle line:84%
So if you come Monday night,
we'll go over the rest

01:19:42.285 --> 01:19:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and bring you up
right to the present.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But you needed to
hear this because this

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning
of what may become

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the most significant
processes in the history

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.740 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the comments I want to
make, in the entire processes

01:19:55.330 --> 01:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that he went through
and all the meetings he

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
had, he never came
across a single woman.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.160 align:middle line:90%


01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
There are no women
involved in these areas

01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:10.000 align:middle line:90%
and that needs to change.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.520 align:middle line:90%
It's an all-male show.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most important
decisions affecting

01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:18.970 align:middle line:84%
your lives, the nation's
lives, and even the planet

01:20:18.970 --> 01:20:26.110 align:middle line:84%
is 100% pure,
unadulterated male.

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And any reasonable person
would think that's imbalanced

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.760 align:middle line:90%
and it needs to change.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
We're making progress,
but I assure you,

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the military
intelligence complex

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:40.558 align:middle line:84%
is not where the House
and Senate is right now.

01:20:40.558 --> 01:20:41.534 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:20:41.534 --> 01:20:45.438 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

01:20:45.438 --> 01:20:46.414 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:20:46.414 --> 01:20:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Progress.

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:49.840 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT]

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:50.797 align:middle line:90%
That is big.

01:20:50.797 --> 01:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's good,
but that's recent.

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:58.608 align:middle line:84%
And he wasn't on board
when he was doing this.

01:20:58.608 --> 01:21:00.400 align:middle line:84%
No, we're making
progress, but I assure you

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
that if you were to drop into
the military intelligence

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:07.690 align:middle line:84%
complex at the decision level
where wars are being made,

01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and invasions of countries
or interferences,

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.825 align:middle line:84%
and elections and everything
else-- these decisions

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:14.070 align:middle line:84%
being made, there's
almost no women.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.197 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now, you're
getting a sense

01:21:16.197 --> 01:21:17.280 align:middle line:90%
that he's on this mission.

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.665 align:middle line:84%
Now again, most people
would be inclined to think

01:21:19.665 --> 01:21:20.790 align:middle line:90%
none of that ever happened.

01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:22.840 align:middle line:90%
It just couldn't happen.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And that business
about, I want you

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:27.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand I'm a skeptic--

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.350 align:middle line:90%
why are they saying that?

01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
This whole business is about
them sizing up Tom DeLonge.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Could he be the guy to
front this operation?

01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
They already knew he
was involved in UFOs.

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:42.727 align:middle line:84%
Tom DeLonge has been involved in
UFOs since the very early '90s.

01:21:42.727 --> 01:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
He was hooked up with Greer
for a number of years.

01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And they were all over
Greer like white on rice.

01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew he
was involved in UFOs,

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
so it's not like they didn't
know that of him going in,

01:21:53.370 --> 01:21:56.438 align:middle line:84%
but they don't know if this
is all going to work out,

01:21:56.438 --> 01:21:58.980 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be, you know,
Tom, this is not working out,

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:01.500 align:middle line:84%
but thanks for coming, and
then he goes out there.

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
They want him to be under the
mindset of, like, you know,

01:22:04.410 --> 01:22:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm a skeptic on this instead of
telling people, well, so and so

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and so and so was
really into this.

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're basically
covering themselves.

01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the whole
play, the whole deal.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's got to
protect themselves

01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:17.870 align:middle line:84%
from this, and that, and what
the perception, and the lie,

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and this, and so forth,
and the clearance,

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and the classification,
and it's quite a dance.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:25.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
worth it, but it is.

01:22:25.650 --> 01:22:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they're sizing him
up, covering themselves.

01:22:27.820 --> 01:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
They haven't cut a
deal with him yet,

01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:32.723 align:middle line:84%
but let's move on
a little bit more.

01:22:32.723 --> 01:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, he gets into something I
think is pretty interesting.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Let me go to this.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And again, this is
still the same interview

01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:43.480 align:middle line:90%
from March the 27th of 2016.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> A garage band
named Chad Allen.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, as
of March 27th, 2016,

01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:52.500 align:middle line:84%
there had been 30
democratic primaries,

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and Hillary had won 20 of
them and Bernie had won 10.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So at the point that
he's talking to them,

01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:01.412 align:middle line:84%
she is still the
likely president.

01:23:01.412 --> 01:23:03.620 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be the
president of the United States.

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:05.287 align:middle line:90%
Let's see, go here.

01:23:05.287 --> 01:23:06.261 align:middle line:90%
All righty.

01:23:06.261 --> 01:23:17.932 align:middle line:90%


01:23:17.932 --> 01:23:19.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I
should back up here.

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:23.710 align:middle line:84%
When I got connected
to the general,

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:26.750 align:middle line:84%
that was a big,
big breakthrough.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And before I talk
a little bit more

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:35.350 align:middle line:84%
about how I got more trust
from these guys, what happened

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:37.960 align:middle line:90%
was is I was up at NASA Ames.

01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I got connected
to a very specific person,

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.115 align:middle line:84%
and that person had me
fly out and meet them.

01:23:42.115 --> 01:23:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is where it
gets really interesting.

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So I go out to a certain city.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And I land at the airport,
and I walk through security,

01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and I meet this person.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The person takes
me to a restaurant

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:58.210 align:middle line:90%
that's right past security.

01:23:58.210 --> 01:24:00.293 align:middle line:84%
And I go to the back
of the restaurant.

01:24:00.293 --> 01:24:01.460 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody in that area.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And we sit at a
booth for two hours.

01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And while we're sitting there,
he leans across the table.

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is the very first
words that were said to me.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It was the Cold War
and every single day,

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
we lived under the
threat of nuclear war.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, we
believed and really thought

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.330 align:middle line:84%
in the deepest part of our
souls that nuclear war could

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:30.970 align:middle line:90%
happen at any given moment.

01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And then he stops, and he goes,
and somewhere in those years--

01:24:35.720 --> 01:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
and he looked me in the eye--
he goes, we found a life form.

01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And everything that we
did and every decision

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that we made with
that life form was

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
because of the
consciousness at that time.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And I said--

01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What life form do you
think he's referring to?

01:24:50.370 --> 01:24:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Want to take a guess?

01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:56.740 align:middle line:84%
Could it be the single living
entity from the Roswell crash,

01:24:56.740 --> 01:24:59.620 align:middle line:84%
not that there weren't a
couple of other crashes?

01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:02.050 align:middle line:84%
But notice how he
phrases it-- very safe.

01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But sir, you know, when
taking into account things that

01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:08.600 align:middle line:90%
this life form has done--

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.800 align:middle line:84%
for example, turning
our nuclear weapons on

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.660 align:middle line:90%
and readying them for launch.

01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then he interrupts me, puts
a finger in my face, and says,

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.440 align:middle line:90%
there are heroes in Russia--

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.550 align:middle line:90%
heroes.

01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And under grave risk to
himself and to his country,

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:25.940 align:middle line:90%
they did not fire back.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I
realized it already started.

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
This new game I
was in of working

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:38.140 align:middle line:84%
with people in, like, a dance
of words and information

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.120 align:middle line:90%
was already coming.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.940 align:middle line:90%


01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:44.620 align:middle line:90%
There was no, like, small talk.

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Like, we didn't just sit
down and just say, hey,

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
let's have a beer and let's
get to know each other.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:51.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's jump back to that.

01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's jump back to
that conversation.

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:54.790 align:middle line:90%
It was the Cold War.

01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's giving
you sort of the setting

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
for how the cover-up, or what
we'd call the cover-up, began.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so this is very
important for people

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.050 align:middle line:90%
to remember.

01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I'm so
excited to start chopping down

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
all these pathetic conspiracies
that I was involved in as well.

01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It was the Cold War.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
He's saying that
every day, they really

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:21.610 align:middle line:84%
thought about the
annihilation of all mankind

01:26:21.610 --> 01:26:25.630 align:middle line:84%
with these weapons that were
hundreds or thousands of times

01:26:25.630 --> 01:26:27.310 align:middle line:84%
bigger than what we
dropped on Japan.

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And we had 20,000
each of those things.

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
something falls on their laps

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.390 align:middle line:90%
that's just extraordinary.

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But even further than
that, if you really

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%
hear what I'm saying
about the nuclear weapons,

01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
the UFOs were turning
our weapons on

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:53.050 align:middle line:84%
just so Russia could pick up
that we're firing our missiles

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and fire theirs first.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a big chess game.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So these guys went
into complete secrecy

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to start coming
up with a defense

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:08.170 align:middle line:90%
system against this phenomenon.

01:27:08.170 --> 01:27:12.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, I try
to tell people some--

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, now, this is heavy stuff
here that I need to clarify.

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:19.430 align:middle line:90%


01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.960 align:middle line:90%
This is somewhat problematic.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I've got concerns about this.

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:26.410 align:middle line:90%


01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:30.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, this is
independent confirmation

01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:36.387 align:middle line:84%
direct from a high-level person
within one of those agencies

01:27:36.387 --> 01:27:37.595 align:middle line:90%
of missiles being turned off.

01:27:37.595 --> 01:27:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've
known about that.

01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:42.640 align:middle line:84%
But he states that they
were turning our missiles

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.606 align:middle line:90%
on in the United States.

01:27:45.606 --> 01:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are no witnesses that
have come forward in the United

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
States about them
turning our missiles on,

01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:56.470 align:middle line:90%
so that's new information.

01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But what we have
plenty of witnesses

01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:00.420 align:middle line:90%
about them turning them off.

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:02.140 align:middle line:90%
They've done it many times.

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:03.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's funny
that I can just

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.680 align:middle line:84%
say that and it's,
like, you know,

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:08.660 align:middle line:84%
ETs are turning our missiles off
and just move on in a sentence.

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:09.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.140 align:middle line:90%


01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But the only evidence that's
come forward and witnesses

01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:17.690 align:middle line:84%
about the turn on was
in the Soviet Union.

01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And when he said,
there are heroes

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Soviet Union,
what he's referring

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.750 align:middle line:90%
to is at least one event--

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and there may have been more--

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:30.750 align:middle line:84%
where in the Soviet Union,
they turned the missiles on.

01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And my thinking on this,
unless I hear otherwise,

01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is that they were turning
them off on our missile silos,

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:43.090 align:middle line:84%
but over there, they were taking
a more aggressive approach.

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And the Soviet
Union was considered

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
by most, even
independent analysts,

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:53.340 align:middle line:84%
as being more aggressive
on the nuclear race issues

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:54.790 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were the ones
parading nuclear missiles

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.940 align:middle line:84%
by the Kremlin every year
on the big platforms.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We didn't do that.

01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.160 align:middle line:84%
We didn't parade our nuclear
missiles and what have you.

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.905 align:middle line:84%
And that they sent a stronger
message to the Soviet

01:29:07.905 --> 01:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
and they felt they needed
to do that-- that's

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:10.590 align:middle line:90%
my interpretation.

01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
He's saying they sent
that same message to us.

01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
If that's true, then this is
really a significant thing.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't think it is.

01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it might
have been a play there,

01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
but this is one of the
things that eventually, Tom

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:26.850 align:middle line:84%
is going to have to address
in an appropriate time.

01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Be with you in just a second.

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.000 align:middle line:84%
What happened in
the Soviet Union?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Standard day,
everything is fine.

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:38.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the launch
sequence begins in the silo.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
many silos it was--

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:40.690 align:middle line:90%
how many.

01:29:40.690 --> 01:29:42.265 align:middle line:84%
It might have been
more than one cluster.

01:29:42.265 --> 01:29:43.210 align:middle line:90%
It could have been just one.

01:29:43.210 --> 01:29:44.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:29:44.230 --> 01:29:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And so their guys are up.

01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:47.050 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:29:47.050 --> 01:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
They're putting calls
into the Moscow central.

01:29:49.150 --> 01:29:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, they
checking everything.

01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we're going
into launch mode,

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:54.173 align:middle line:84%
except I'm pretty
sure if I recall,

01:29:54.173 --> 01:29:56.590 align:middle line:84%
normally that would not happen
unless an order had already

01:29:56.590 --> 01:29:57.080 align:middle line:90%
come down.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get that order, so
naturally they're calling back.

01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:59.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no order.

01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, these
launch cycles have--

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.190 align:middle line:84%
there's levels of
them and it goes

01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.440 align:middle line:84%
to the next level, and the
next level, the next level.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.180 align:middle line:84%
These guys are running around
the missile control area going,

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.180 align:middle line:90%
what are we going to do?

01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.370 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

01:30:13.370 --> 01:30:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And they couldn't get
confirmation what the hell

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.688 align:middle line:90%
was going on from Moscow.

01:30:18.688 --> 01:30:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they realize
there's nothing we can do.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:22.520 align:middle line:84%
These missiles are
going to launch

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.600 align:middle line:90%
and that's going to be it.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that's
going to be it.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And at the very last
cycle, it went off.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.750 align:middle line:84%
They didn't then shut
it down, and relaunch,

01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and do anything else.

01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not they
discerned that there

01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:43.755 align:middle line:84%
were ET craft hovering
overhead, I don't know.

01:30:43.755 --> 01:30:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we
got that report.

01:30:45.130 --> 01:30:47.380 align:middle line:84%
In our case, we have
plenty of reports

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
of the craft just sitting
right over the damn silos

01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:51.490 align:middle line:84%
when the missiles
were turned off.

01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so he's saying that
that happened here.

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:56.830 align:middle line:84%
He's implying that
they were doing stuff

01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to play with us to
possibly set us to war.

01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
that, and so this

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.640 align:middle line:84%
is one of those things
that needs to be clarified.

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:06.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just trying to give
you a sense of the significance

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
of some of the points that are
emerging in this process that

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.587 align:middle line:84%
ultimately leads the
announcement of the

01:31:10.587 --> 01:31:11.802 align:middle line:90%
To The Stars Academy.

01:31:11.802 --> 01:31:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is that area
where they're still

01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:16.445 align:middle line:84%
going through the feeler
process of dealing with him

01:31:16.445 --> 01:31:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and talking with him.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:20.380 align:middle line:84%
They have not yet
committed to the program.

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:23.328 align:middle line:84%
So everything they say
is of a certain category.

01:31:23.328 --> 01:31:24.370 align:middle line:90%
You have to interpret it.

01:31:24.370 --> 01:31:26.410 align:middle line:84%
It may not be exactly
what it means.

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But his statement about
their-- his history--

01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:33.340 align:middle line:84%
there are heroes in Moscow
is a very poignant thing.

01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:34.720 align:middle line:90%
He basically knows, yeah.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.798 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it
happened more than once.

01:31:36.798 --> 01:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
they almost launched,

01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:41.935 align:middle line:84%
not because of ETs ratcheting
up the launch sequence,

01:31:41.935 --> 01:31:44.290 align:middle line:84%
but because a
missile out of Sweden

01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
that nobody knew was going
to be launched was heading

01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:48.592 align:middle line:84%
and it basically triggered
their defense systems.

01:31:48.592 --> 01:31:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And it was a single officer in
that base in outside of Moscow

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.020 align:middle line:84%
that refused to go
ahead and launch even

01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.400 align:middle line:90%
though the order came through.

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:00.030 align:middle line:90%


01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
he got back to Moscow.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
They didn't put him
in prison or anything.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.270 align:middle line:90%
And he quietly led his life.

01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, he
was given an award.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Why do I say this?

01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Folks, you don't know
how close we have

01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
come to having it all go away.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.900 align:middle line:84%
The politicians don't
want you to know that.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.780 align:middle line:84%
The journalists don't see any
ratings in talking about that.

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:26.760 align:middle line:84%
The history of the
last 60 years is

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.728 align:middle line:84%
we've been on the cutting
edge of complete annihilation.

01:32:29.728 --> 01:32:30.770 align:middle line:90%
And why does that matter?

01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:32.880 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
government we have now

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is far more incompetent
than the government that

01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:37.810 align:middle line:90%
was going through that period.

01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a miracle we
get from day to day.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.683 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just not talking
about the last two years.

01:32:41.683 --> 01:32:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the last 30 years.

01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
We have got to get
control of this situation.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We have got to start
electing people

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.870 align:middle line:90%
with brains who can think.

01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:54.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop electing corrupt
idiots, and fools, and people

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that have been bought
by big corporations.

01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:01.490 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, then something like
this is going to happen again,

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:03.697 align:middle line:84%
and they're going to
launch, and that'll be that.

01:33:03.697 --> 01:33:04.497 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:33:04.497 --> 01:33:49.407 align:middle line:90%


01:33:49.407 --> 01:33:50.405 align:middle line:90%
I will--

01:33:50.405 --> 01:33:54.450 align:middle line:90%


01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, there
was a Cold War.

01:33:56.610 --> 01:34:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
days, as it matured--

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, because at one
point, they only

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.720 align:middle line:84%
had about-- there was
only about 15 atom bombs.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:10.160 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at the point
that Kennedy was elected,

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.978 align:middle line:84%
there weren't that many
bombs in existence.

01:34:11.978 --> 01:34:13.520 align:middle line:84%
There were only two
nations involved.

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And Kennedy, either deliberately
or because he was misled,

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.650 align:middle line:84%
misrepresented how
strong the Soviet Union

01:34:19.650 --> 01:34:21.130 align:middle line:90%
was to help him get elected.

01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I get that-- playing
with the circumstances.

01:34:23.730 --> 01:34:27.070 align:middle line:84%
But I assure you that the
circumstance that eventually

01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:28.990 align:middle line:84%
evolved to 86,000
nuclear weapons

01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:31.870 align:middle line:84%
in eight countries and the
near launch in about six

01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:35.350 align:middle line:84%
or seven times was
not a put-up job.

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:40.270 align:middle line:84%
That was a Cold War that
almost blew out several times.

01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And overstating
this, and overstating

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that, and a lot of
mistakes that were made,

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.627 align:middle line:84%
it's possible had we
handled it differently,

01:34:46.627 --> 01:34:47.710 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't have happened.

01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:50.590 align:middle line:90%


01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:54.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the great unbelievable
historic-- oh, I'm rolling now,

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:55.270 align:middle line:90%
folks.

01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:57.645 align:middle line:84%
Forgive me, but you know,
this is a workshop, OK?

01:34:57.645 --> 01:35:00.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not a lecture.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Flukes of history is
it's July of 1947.

01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:11.043 align:middle line:84%
The Soviet Union, I
think, have not actually--

01:35:11.043 --> 01:35:12.710 align:middle line:84%
they haven't tested
their hydrogen bomb.

01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:14.877 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if they've
even tested their atom bomb,

01:35:14.877 --> 01:35:17.397 align:middle line:84%
but we knew that they
had them under works.

01:35:17.397 --> 01:35:18.980 align:middle line:84%
We knew they were
working on missiles,

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.930 align:middle line:90%
but they didn't have any yet.

01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:25.610 align:middle line:84%
1947-- it's not that
long after World War II.

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But the Soviet Union was
taking political moves,

01:35:28.410 --> 01:35:32.060 align:middle line:84%
which is what prompted in
that year, Winston Churchill

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:35.570 align:middle line:84%
to use that classic phrase,
the Iron Curtain across Europe.

01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:39.650 align:middle line:84%
OK, so things are getting a
little tense, but believe me,

01:35:39.650 --> 01:35:42.700 align:middle line:84%
we can't blow the
world up at that point.

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, that can happen.

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:48.257 align:middle line:84%
And there's a crash in
Roswell of an ET craft.

01:35:48.257 --> 01:35:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And because not
everybody's been given

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the emails about
all this stuff yet

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:53.560 align:middle line:84%
because pretty much
what they didn't know

01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:56.900 align:middle line:84%
was all pretty much
departmentalized--

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:58.918 align:middle line:84%
the really good guys
running that base

01:35:58.918 --> 01:36:01.210 align:middle line:84%
feel they had a saucer, and
by God, that's pretty cool.

01:36:01.210 --> 01:36:03.255 align:middle line:90%
Put out a press release.

01:36:03.255 --> 01:36:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's picked up
all over the country

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.338 align:middle line:84%
and reporters are getting on
planes, and trains, and boats,

01:36:07.338 --> 01:36:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and heading straight
for Roswell immediately.

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It was news across the
country, but this was '47, OK--

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:15.593 align:middle line:84%
no internet, no
smartphones, none of that.

01:36:15.593 --> 01:36:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to go
interview every living

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:20.810 align:middle line:84%
person in Roswell, New
Mexico, I can assure you,

01:36:20.810 --> 01:36:22.460 align:middle line:84%
and getting all
kinds of testimony

01:36:22.460 --> 01:36:25.110 align:middle line:84%
from people about what they
saw and what was going on.

01:36:25.110 --> 01:36:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the whole thing would
have blown out right then,

01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:30.640 align:middle line:90%
but Truman acted quickly.

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.230 align:middle line:84%
He got in touch with
Rainey, and said,

01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:33.730 align:middle line:84%
you must turn this
around right now.

01:36:33.730 --> 01:36:39.610 align:middle line:84%
You must immediately
change this scenario.

01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
That goes in, Rainey orders--

01:36:41.230 --> 01:36:45.563 align:middle line:90%


01:36:45.563 --> 01:36:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a memory moment.

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:50.170 align:middle line:90%
The Roswell guy, Marcel--

01:36:50.170 --> 01:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Jesse Marcel orders
him immediately come

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to the Fort Worth base.

01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
They got him to bring
some stuff with him.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.690 align:middle line:84%
They throw together
a press conference

01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.570 align:middle line:84%
where they bring out some
aluminum foil wrapping

01:37:01.570 --> 01:37:04.210 align:middle line:84%
some fish in Rainey's freezer,
and have him hold that up

01:37:04.210 --> 01:37:05.740 align:middle line:90%
and say this is what crashed.

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a saucer.

01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And this was 1947 when
the American policed

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:14.600 align:middle line:90%
people because of World War II.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And what we did and
what we accomplished

01:37:17.650 --> 01:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
believed what the
government said.

01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:25.210 align:middle line:90%
We believe the governor then.

01:37:25.210 --> 01:37:27.550 align:middle line:84%
People back then, if they
saw what was going on now,

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:29.230 align:middle line:90%
they would be dumbstruck.

01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:31.000 align:middle line:84%
They would say, I
can't believe it.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.270 align:middle line:90%
What has happened?

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:33.220 align:middle line:90%
How is it possible?

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:36.383 align:middle line:84%
So the government says, no,
it was a weather balloon.

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.300 align:middle line:90%
And people said, fine.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.844 align:middle line:90%
And the story dropped.

01:37:39.844 --> 01:37:44.010 align:middle line:84%
But what happens if
Truman is like Marshall

01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:48.090 align:middle line:90%
with the invasion of Hawaii--

01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:49.893 align:middle line:84%
was out riding his
horse that day,

01:37:49.893 --> 01:37:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't get the message,
and he didn't get to Rainey

01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in time, and the
press got there,

01:37:53.710 --> 01:37:55.168 align:middle line:84%
and they start
interviewing people,

01:37:55.168 --> 01:37:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and basically the
story's coming out?

01:37:56.730 --> 01:37:59.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a crash
vehicle and bodies

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:01.230 align:middle line:90%
that are not from this Earth.

01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
The truth embargo ends--
never even begins--

01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:08.950 align:middle line:84%
and the truth is out in 1947,
before the nuclear aspect

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:11.620 align:middle line:90%
of the Cold War gets underway.

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I believe we wouldn't
have had a Cold War.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:17.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe it would have
truncated it right there,

01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and we would have
reconfigured very quickly,

01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and we would have
decided, wait a minute.

01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:25.477 align:middle line:90%
We now know we're not alone.

01:38:25.477 --> 01:38:27.310 align:middle line:84%
We know there's
extraterrestrials out there.

01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:28.210 align:middle line:90%
They're engaging us.

01:38:28.210 --> 01:38:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Possibilities are unlimited.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to build
toward the next war--

01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:33.720 align:middle line:90%
World War III?

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to spend over the
next 20 years, $20 to $25

01:38:36.850 --> 01:38:40.150 align:middle line:84%
trillion building
vast nuclear weapons

01:38:40.150 --> 01:38:42.323 align:middle line:84%
so that we'll have a
mutual-assured destruction,

01:38:42.323 --> 01:38:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and not have a war
anymore, or whatever?

01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:45.365 align:middle line:84%
We'll just have
proxy wars, where

01:38:45.365 --> 01:38:47.600 align:middle line:84%
we'll kill millions of
people in poor countries,

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.620 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have to fight
on each other's land.

01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.428 align:middle line:84%
No, they might not
have done that.

01:38:51.428 --> 01:38:53.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how close
we came to maybe avoiding

01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:55.700 align:middle line:90%
the whole damn thing.

01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And those trillions
of dollars might

01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.050 align:middle line:84%
have been spent on your
schools, your roads,

01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:01.270 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of other things.

01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Now but of course, these
statements that I'm telling you

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:09.790 align:middle line:84%
now, no journalist wants to
hear because the government says

01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:11.710 align:middle line:84%
there are no
extraterrestrials, and so this

01:39:11.710 --> 01:39:14.230 align:middle line:90%
is a ludicrous statement.

01:39:14.230 --> 01:39:16.510 align:middle line:84%
It's funny how
suppressing the truth

01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:21.060 align:middle line:84%
leads to not knowing
about incredible things

01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.430 align:middle line:84%
because they can't be true
because certain fundamental

01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.980 align:middle line:90%
premises are not true.

01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:28.660 align:middle line:90%
So what we have here--

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:30.750 align:middle line:84%
it's been a long
day for everybody--

01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:34.140 align:middle line:84%
is the beginning of an
extraordinary history

01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:36.720 align:middle line:84%
that could very well lead, maybe
within the next four or five

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.520 align:middle line:90%
months--

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.740 align:middle line:84%
assuming there are certain
developments in Washington DC--

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to finally ending
the truth embargo.

01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And To The Stars
Academy with Tom

01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
as its head backed up by members
of the military intelligence

01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:53.142 align:middle line:84%
complex have got more
things to bring out.

01:39:53.142 --> 01:39:54.600 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting
for the right time.

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:56.100 align:middle line:84%
They've got more
gun camera footage.

01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.160 align:middle line:90%
They've got a lot of stuff.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.680 align:middle line:84%
And with the political
story dying away,

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:02.150 align:middle line:84%
the entire media
will have nothing

01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to do except seize on this.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And later this year, we could
see some extraordinary things

01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:08.690 align:middle line:90%
happening.

01:40:08.690 --> 01:40:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there you got a taste
of how that history began,

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.570 align:middle line:84%
but there's much
more to it than that.

01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:17.620 align:middle line:90%
