00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.090 align:middle line:90%
>> What's up, guys?

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.800 align:middle line:90%
How's it going?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.636 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:00:09.636 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, you guys are very sweet.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, you guys
are going to be here.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You guys are in
for a treat today.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I have the honor
to be joined onstage today

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:84%
by bestselling
author, Steven Kotler.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.660 align:middle line:84%
He wrote "The Rise of
Superman," which decodes

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
ultimate human performance.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:90%
He co-wrote "Stealing Fire."

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:90%
He co-wrote "Abundance."

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:90%
He co-wrote "Bold."

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So this guy has written
about technology innovation,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:84%
altered states, flow
states, and all that jazz.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to have a
conversation today about all

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the things that I obsess
about and make videos about

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:90%
and he writes about.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sort of inspired
by the log line of the Edge

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Foundation, which says to arrive
at the edge of the world's

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.810 align:middle line:84%
knowledge, to gather the world's
most interesting minds, to put

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
them together in a
room, and to have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
them ask each other
the questions they've

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:90%
been asking themselves.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I'm
given the opportunity

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
to invite somebody
to join me on stage,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm always like, who is
the most interesting mind

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:90%
that I have access to?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And definitely, Mr. Steven
Kotler is one of those minds.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So please welcome
him onstage now.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.186 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So we want to keep this
kind of a fireside chat vibe.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
We want to have a real
conversation about the pressing

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
issues of our age, and the
things that we are obsessing

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and mulling over, the
things that we are trying

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:84%
to demystify, the things
that we are trying to reverse

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:90%
engineer and understand.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan famously
said that understanding

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.880 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of ecstasy.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And he also coined
the term wonder

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
junkie to describe that
insatiable curiosity that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.180 align:middle line:84%
haunts our dreams, the warm at
the core, the thing that makes

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
us look at the
cosmos, at the stars,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and at the perimeters of
our own minds to try to make

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.760 align:middle line:90%
sense of what is going on.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:90%
What is shaping our world?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:90%
Where have we come from?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And also, how to make sure
that our understanding

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
of the great mysteries doesn't
get caught up in too much woo.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
Because poetry is beautiful, but
science is just as beautiful.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And so today, we'll kind of
look at both sides of that coin.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So the title of this
conversation-- and it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.490 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a conversation.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.245 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of framing
it, is we are the gods now.

00:02:44.245 --> 00:02:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, that's a kind
of heretical thing, right?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.280 align:middle line:90%
To take claim over that.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:90%
We are the gods now.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how dare we, right?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Where is the cosmic humility?

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:84%
We should bow down
before the cosmos

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and bow down before
the great mystery.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
about that, right?

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Carl Sagan said, we are a way
for the cosmos to know itself.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:90%
We are of nature.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
We come from nature.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.070 align:middle line:90%
We are nature.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.580 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that we
can steward our own destiny.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:90%
We can govern our own path.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.630 align:middle line:84%
I am the captain of my faith,
or I'm the captain of my soul

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the
hell that quote is.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.810 align:middle line:84%
But the point being that we have
this immense creative capacity

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.540 align:middle line:84%
to engender our
dreams, to sort of

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.560 align:middle line:84%
actualize our minds, to
manifest our imagination.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And we've created tools
that are giving us the power

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
to shape the world, to transform
the world, to impact the world,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
to create and recreate the world
and also, to destroy the world.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so as Stewart Brand
said, we are as gods

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and might as well
get good at it.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of the
framing, the context,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and the background
behind what we're

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:90%
going to talk about today.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So we'd like to start first
with this notion of technology.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Steven Kotler co-wrote a book
with Peter Diamandis called

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:90%
"Abundance--

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.883 align:middle line:84%
Why the Future will be
Better Than You Think."

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
terrified of the future.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.758 align:middle line:90%
They think of climate change.

00:04:04.758 --> 00:04:06.340 align:middle line:90%
They think of runaway AI.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
They think of technology,
robot overlords taking

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:84%
over the world, and
everything going

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to shit when, in fact,
there is remarkable progress

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
across many fields
in technology.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And technology is
advancing at rates

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:90%
we can't even begin to fathom.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So let's just kind
of start with that.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.227 align:middle line:90%
Steven--

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there a question in there?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what comes
to mind for you when you think

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.910 align:middle line:84%
of the astounding
progress that we're seeing

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:90%
in technology and innovation?

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're best friends
with Peter Diamandis.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The guy is running around
the world talking about how

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.010 align:middle line:90%
we're going to save the world.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.933 align:middle line:84%
So how are we going to save
the world using technology?

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
>> You know how we're
going to save the world,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:84%
but we'll come back
to that answer.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to start with the
speed of technology, because--

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.815 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's useful to put a
little context around it.

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
When Peter and I wrote
"Abundance" 10 years ago,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.910 align:middle line:84%
I guess, "Abundance" was about
individual lines of technology

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that were accelerating
exponentially,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
meaning they're doubling
at a periodic rate.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.985 align:middle line:84%
Computers are the
great example, right?

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Every 18 months, they
get twice as fast,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
but the cost stays the same
That's an exponential growth

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:90%
curve.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And it starts out really
slow, and it gets really fast,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:90%
really quickly.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I take 30 exponential
steps or 30 regular steps

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:90%
from right here--

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I end up 30 feet away.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Exponential steps-- it doubles.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.110 align:middle line:84%
So 1 becomes 2,
becomes 4, becomes 8.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%
I take 30 exponential steps.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm a billion feet away.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I've just orbited
the Earth 26 times.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So when we wrote
"Abundance," we were

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
talking about individual
lines of technology

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:90%
becoming exponential.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And a technology
becomes exponential

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:90%
once it becomes digital.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
Once a technology
becomes digital,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
it jumps on the
back of Moore's law

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and starts
accelerating this way.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And in "Abundance,"
we talked about 12

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
different exponential
technologies that are emerging.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing today
is these individual lines

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
are starting to converge, and
they're starting to overlap.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.813 align:middle line:84%
And that's starting to
produce incredible effects.

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil, who's the
head of AI at Google

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and who's been really
good with his predictions

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
about the future, has
estimated that we're

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
going to experience 20,000
years of technological change

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:90%
in the next hundred years.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Put it in context.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It means we're going to
go-- birth of agriculture

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Industrial Revolution
twice in 86 years.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the speed we're looking
at that, the speed of change

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.500 align:middle line:84%
that's coming, which is
both amazing and terrifying

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.092 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, I think,
to your question--

00:06:18.092 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:84%
this is what we
said in "Abundance."

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
exactly what Stewart

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.480 align:middle line:84%
meant by we are as gods, we
might as well get good at it,

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
is we said at this point what
the world faces-- incredibly

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.110 align:middle line:90%
difficult challenges.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Our technology gives us
the power to solve them,

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.838 align:middle line:84%
but it won't do
it automatically.

00:06:35.838 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
This is not techno
utopianism, right?

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's going to require the
greatest cooperative effort

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.210 align:middle line:90%
in history to pull this off.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So all it does is give us--
it gives us an escape valve.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
We can do it, but
we better figure out

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:90%
how to work together.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Immense power, but also
immense responsibility.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And he got into this notion
of the exponential speed

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:90%
of technological progress.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that 30-steps
example for me

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
became my sort of runaway train
to imagine the impossible,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.238 align:middle line:90%
because we have brains.

00:07:05.238 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And Peter Diamandis
talks about this.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.288 align:middle line:84%
And Ray Kurzweil
talks about this.

00:07:08.288 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:84%
We have brains that
evolved in a world that

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:90%
was linear and local.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:90%
We are wired.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Our intuition about change
over time is linear.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.567 align:middle line:84%
That's just what governs
our natural intuition.

00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's weirder than that.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Kelly MacDonald did some
really cool research.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have a built-in
10-year time horizon.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:90%
We cannot see past 10 years.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.742 align:middle line:84%
So I run a company called
the EQ with some friends.

00:07:29.742 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And we bring together
technologists

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and environmentalists to solve
environmental challenges.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have a whole
retro-casting process that

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:84%
we've developed to get people to
be able to see past 10 years--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:41.610 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could have
those exponential lenses,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.000 align:middle line:84%
we would gain so
much perspective.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So this notion of the 30 linear
steps getting you to 30 and 30

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.330 align:middle line:84%
exponential steps getting
you to a billion--

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
just take-- pause on
that for a second, right?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Because we're calling this,
we are the gods now, right?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
30 exponential steps gets you
a billion times farther, right?

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And that exponential
progress is the reason

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:84%
why the smart phone in
your pocket today that you

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
use every day that
you take for granted,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that you complain
when the signal drops,

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
is a million times cheaper,
a million times smaller,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
and a thousand
times more powerful

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:84%
than what used to
be a $60 million

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
supercomputer that was half a
building in size 40 years ago.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't take you being an
engineer, or a mathematician,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
or a technologist to just
grasp that kind of progress.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The supercomputer was the size
of this room 40 years ago.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It cost $60 million.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, you can go to
an iPhone store, right?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Go to an Apple
Store and buy this.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a million
times cheaper.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Million times cheaper.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.727 align:middle line:84%
For those who say these
tools are only for the rich,

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a million times
cheaper than what

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:84%
it used to be 40 years ago,
a million times smaller,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and a thousand
times more powerful.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So that means that, again,
as Kurzweil likes to say,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.970 align:middle line:84%
a young kid in Africa or
Mexico with a smart phone

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:84%
has better communications
technology than a head of state

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.303 align:middle line:90%
had 25 years ago.

00:09:08.303 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So I don't give a
shit how cynical

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:90%
you are, how skeptical you are.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact, right?

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
That's a fact that a young kid
with an internet connection

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.210 align:middle line:84%
on their phone has
better communications

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
technology than a
president had 25 years ago.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:90%
Undeniable progress.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Astounding supercomputers
in our pockets.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, this reminds me of
Steven Johnson's line

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.142 align:middle line:84%
of the adjacent
possible from his book,

00:09:33.142 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
"Where Good Ideas Come From."

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And he says the
adjacent possible

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
is a shadow from the
future that hovers

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
over the present, a
map of all the ways

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.210 align:middle line:84%
in which the present
can reinvent itself.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of we
being the gods now,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
we also have to start
thinking in terms

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
of adjacent
possibilities on the back

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.270 align:middle line:90%
of exponential technologies.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the scenarios,
and tools, and technologies

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
that you guys modeled
in "Abundance,"

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
like some shit that just like
blows your mind in terms of

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So Peter and I are working on
a new book that'll be out next

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.215 align:middle line:84%
February, and it opens with
a chapter on the future

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
of transportation.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And it opens at
the Uber flying car

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
conference, which took place
in LA eight months ago.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And what you probably
don't know is

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.670 align:middle line:84%
that while Uber is going
to go autonomous completely

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
by 2019 and 2020, by
2023 in LA and Dallas,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:29.260 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
flying autonomous taxis.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.920 align:middle line:84%
By the way, so I wrote a
story about a guy named

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Dezso Molnar, who's a friend
of mine, who invented probably

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.500 align:middle line:84%
the world's first flying
car, flying helicopter that

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:90%
actually flew and was usable.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:90%
This was 15 years ago.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone from
the very first one that

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.050 align:middle line:84%
was a kit car in
somebody's garage

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
to taxis in three
years, four years--

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
flying cars.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:52.815 align:middle line:90%
So that's incredible.

00:10:52.815 --> 00:10:54.398 align:middle line:84%
The other one that
I always think of--

00:10:54.398 --> 00:10:56.493 align:middle line:84%
and this is an example
that I always sort of like

00:10:56.493 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
to give people when I think
about this, because it's

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:90%
really personal.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Biotechnology is advancing
about four to five times

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:90%
as fast as Moore's law.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So it is doubling
in power, roughly

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.230 align:middle line:90%
every four to five months.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And what that means is every
day we manage to stay alive,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
we gain five hours
of life expectancy.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.490 align:middle line:90%
No exercise required.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.804 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:90%
That's incredible to me.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the one that
always sort of blows my mind.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
The other one that
blows my mind--

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
so a bunch of years ago, I got a
chance to spend a bunch of time

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
with Hugh Herr, who's the head
of biomechatronics at MIT.

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:90%
He is the first--

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.690 align:middle line:84%
he created the world's
first bionic ankle,

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.080 align:middle line:84%
which was the first
FDA-approved bionic body part.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
six, seven years ago,

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.090 align:middle line:84%
it was so robust
that soldiers were

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.648 align:middle line:84%
returning to combat, wearing
them in Afghanistan and Iraq.

00:11:45.648 --> 00:11:46.940 align:middle line:90%
People were running triathlons.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.082 align:middle line:90%
So it's a real bionic body part.

00:11:49.082 --> 00:11:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet, because of the
speed of biotechnology,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:90%
it is so five years ago.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Today, 50% of the human body
is replaceable by bionics.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.180 align:middle line:90%
>> 50%?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> 50%.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.630 align:middle line:84%
50% of you is going to get
swapped out, all right?

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
With 3D printing body
replacement body parts, right?

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what's--

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:90%
It resonates so deeply with me.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I was deeply
affected by a book

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:84%
I read by Ernest Becker,
called "The Denial of Death."

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And the key idea
behind the book is

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:84%
that the source of our
existential malaise,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
our cosmological depression--

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.190 align:middle line:84%
we are feeling so
small, is that we are

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%
stuck in these mortal bodies.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
But we can kind of contemplate
the infinite, right?

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we've
emerged from nothing.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.715 align:middle line:90%
We have a name.

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We have this consciousness of
self, this deep inner feeling,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.760 align:middle line:84%
this excruciating
inner yearning for life

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:40.900 align:middle line:90%
and for self-expression.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:84%
We want to sing the songs
that orchestrate the universe.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:84%
We want to explore
wonders beyond measure.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
We want to experience
transitory, enchanted moments

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in which we can hold
our breath, compelled

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
into aesthetic contemplations
we neither understand or desire,

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
face to face with
things that are measured

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.220 align:middle line:90%
to our capacity for wonder.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I want to drink infinity, right?

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.217 align:middle line:90%
And yet--

00:13:01.217 --> 00:13:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE],,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --I'm bounded.

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm finite, right?

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And that haunts my
dreams to no end.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I tell people jokingly,
but it's really true.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm like a damn hypochondriac.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:90%
How could you not be, right?

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
You're dependent on a heartbeat.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:84%
You have so much you want
to do, so much you want, so

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
many ways you want to express
yourselves, so many books

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
you want to read, so many
questions you want answered.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you get the flu, and
it knocks you on the damn floor.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:84%
An invisible force
takes away your agency,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.840 align:middle line:90%
shrinks you down to nothing.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the common
cold is existentially

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
disempowering for a
species that can put

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.870 align:middle line:90%
a human being on the damn moon.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I think
of biotechnology,

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.630 align:middle line:84%
biotechnology means mastering
the information processes

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.680 align:middle line:90%
of biology, right?

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Because it really starts
to get interesting

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:84%
when you realize that
we are made of language,

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:84%
that we are alphabetic all the
way down, that we are literally

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.680 align:middle line:90%
made of code, right?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Biology is software that
writes its own hardware.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Our genes are little
software programs.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So we are literally
made of language.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
We are literally
information, right?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And so if we could learn
to master that language,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:84%
manipulate that language,
reprogram our genes away

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.930 align:middle line:84%
from disease, away
from aging, so

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
that people don't die
from cancer, but also

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:90%
don't die from time.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.710 align:middle line:90%
Why should time kill us?

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're a bad person, if you
hurt other people, then, OK.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:90%
Put you in a cell.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you're like a curious
student of the cosmos,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:90%
I want infinity.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:90%
Nothing less will do.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
Eternity.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is real
that is not eternal,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
said Miguel [INAUDIBLE],,
in tragic sense of life.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And so when I hear that
gene sequencing is going

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:84%
three times faster than
Moore's law, three times faster

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:84%
than exponential, and I hear
Craig Venter who synthesized

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.768 align:middle line:84%
the first synthetic
organisms say, when asked,

00:14:52.768 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
do you worry that
you're playing God?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.230 align:middle line:90%
He said who's playing?

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Who's playing?

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.510 align:middle line:84%
When I see Larry Page create
Calico, the California life

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.880 align:middle line:84%
extension company-- he's
the co-founder of Google,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.622 align:middle line:84%
creating a software
company for biology,

00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:07.330 align:middle line:84%
getting a cover on
"Time" magazine called

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.760 align:middle line:90%
"Google and the End of Death."

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
This is where we're heading,
and we shouldn't cower.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And we shouldn't shrink down
before this ambition, right?

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But we should rise up
before this ambition.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
As Alan Harrington wrote
in "The Immortalist,"

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
having invented the gods,
we can now turn into them.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think nothing
else will do.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And so when are we going to
see radical life extension,

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
like true radical
life extension?

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So one, you like
people more than I do.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So you might be more hopeful
about this particular thing

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:90%
than I am.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:90%
But ignoring that, no, we just--

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I just actually wrote
the longevity chapter

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:90%
for "Convergence" with Peter.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is, by the way, hard
to find a longevity company

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.980 align:middle line:84%
in the world right now that
my co-author is not somehow

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.860 align:middle line:90%
involved in, which is odd.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.630 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
getting interesting.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we're going to
start seeing stem cells.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Next 10 years-- we'll
start seeing stem cells.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Replacement body parts are
coming a lot faster than you

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:90%
could possibly imagine.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
Again, 10-year,
12-year time horizon.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's some just amazing
medical technology that's

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.080 align:middle line:90%
also moving this quickly.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to--
the next 10, 12 years

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.400 align:middle line:84%
is when I think we're
going to start seeing

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:90%
the first edge of those things.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 to 12?

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.672 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 to 12 years.

00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Actual, measurable
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to go back
to, why are you so--

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.028 align:middle line:84%
aren't you curious
about what's next?

00:16:49.028 --> 00:16:51.695 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm just afraid
of being disappointed.

00:16:51.695 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, fair point.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Plus, I also think we
have such an immense creative

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.080 align:middle line:84%
capacity right now to kind
of warp the world and make it

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.283 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:17:03.283 --> 00:17:04.450 align:middle line:90%
We could also make it worse.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
We've made it
worse in some ways.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But in so many ways, we've
made it better, right?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.199 align:middle line:84%
Terence McKenna's wonderful
line that the human-made world

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is the condensation
of human imagination.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.870 align:middle line:84%
Or David Deutsch in "The
Beginning of Infinity,"

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.912 align:middle line:84%
where he talks about the
notion of the topography

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of any great city like
Manhattan or Los Angeles,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and that the physical
topography of a city

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:84%
is shaped more by
the forces of mind

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
by creativity, by economics,
by trade, by imagination

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:90%
than by the forces of geology.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:90%
So mind has trumped geology.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like when
we think of ourselves

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.215 align:middle line:84%
and what we are, like
holy shit, right?

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
We are this emergent
property of the universe

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:90%
that can self-modify.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And that is like a coral
reef-like animal, an extruder

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:90%
of technological material.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We take in matter
of low organization.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:84%
We put it through the
filters of the human mind.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:84%
We extrude space
shuttles and iPhones

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and eventually,
hopefully, starships.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Who wouldn't want to be
immortal and go explore

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:90%
the edges of the universe?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
once an article

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.640 align:middle line:84%
by Ross Anderson about the
Hubble Space Telescope.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a
marvelous meditation

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.040 align:middle line:84%
on the implications
of what we've

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.123 align:middle line:84%
made, what we've conceived, what
we've like literally extruded

00:18:16.123 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:90%
from our imagination, right?

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.830 align:middle line:84%
He says that the Hubble that
sits in orbit, this space

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:84%
telescope allows us to
mainline space and time

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:90%
through the optic nerve, right?

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Look at-- listen to the poetry,
but also the literal truth

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.530 align:middle line:90%
behind what he's saying.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
We've created this
artificial lens.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.770 align:middle line:90%
We've hovered it in space.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can
mainline the universe

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.730 align:middle line:90%
through our optic nerve.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do, right?

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
The upright monkey
that shed its fur

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.840 align:middle line:84%
can now mainline space and
time through the optic nerve.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And that when we stare at images
of the Hubble of the Deep Field

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:84%
photographs taken
by the Hubble, we

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.157 align:middle line:84%
literally-- through the
sheer aesthetic force

00:18:51.157 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of its discoveries, the
Hubble has distilled

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.090 align:middle line:84%
the complex abstractions
of astrophysics

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:57.370 align:middle line:84%
into singular expressions
of color and light

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:01.005 align:middle line:84%
that vindicate Keats' famous
couplet that "Beauty is truth,

00:19:01.005 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:90%
and truth is beauty."

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we are not gods,
then what are we?

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I just can't take that in and
somehow assimilate the idea

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that we're also breathing pieces
of defecating meat destined

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
to die and ultimately,
no more significant

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.385 align:middle line:90%
than a lizard or a potato.

00:19:23.385 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:84%
That duality of us is
so achingly tragic.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.745 align:middle line:84%
We are so beautiful,
but so tragic.

00:19:30.745 --> 00:19:32.608 align:middle line:84%
>> I know some
really good lizards.

00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> You know some
really good lizards?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:35.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:90%
But that's kind of the point.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
And so Steven--

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're a writer.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.210 align:middle line:84%
You're compelled by your
anxiety, your neuroses,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and your creativity to
frenetically output brilliance

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that will outlast
you symbolically.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So there must be some part of
you that resonates with that.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Or that's not what
drives your creativity?

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.705 align:middle line:84%
You make art from a place of
existential dread for sure

00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and have for as long as
I've known you, which

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:90%
is a while now and interesting.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I have taken pain and
turned it into art.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is what sort of--

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
anxiety will get you out
of bed and try to turn--

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll get up early
and start writing.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.840 align:middle line:84%
So I can stop thinking
right away, for sure,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
at a low motivation.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I'm just
a creative, right?

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So once I'm done
with the project,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm onto the next project.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:90%
My editor's happy.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm good.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.910 align:middle line:84%
I like-- get me
something else to do.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea that
there might be immortality--

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I often forget that
I even have readers

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
on the other end of what I'm
doing, let alone immortality.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.342 align:middle line:90%
Just how I work with it.

00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:46.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:46.142 --> 00:20:47.134 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:20:47.134 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But you've been actually--
you have actually taken that

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.610 align:middle line:90%
existential threat and really--

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, A, you've
made art about it.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
But you've really been
successful with it, which

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:90%
makes me wonder if it's just--

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.723 align:middle line:90%
is that just extreme anxiety?

00:21:02.723 --> 00:21:04.082 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:04.082 --> 00:21:05.577 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.577 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.003 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm very expressive in
my creativity, or I try to be,

00:21:10.003 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:90%
because I'm very passionate.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.285 align:middle line:84%
But I create very safe
containers for that.

00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
know that line by Flaubert.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Be disciplined
and orderly in your life,

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.706 align:middle line:84%
so that you can be violent
and dangerous in your work."

00:21:20.706 --> 00:21:21.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's good.

00:21:21.506 --> 00:21:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd be butchering
it a little bit.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
this other one that

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is-- this has something
to degree of like,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:84%
it's our responsibility to
live so intensely that death

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:31.220 align:middle line:90%
will tremble to take us.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's definitely
a kind of--

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.970 align:middle line:84%
a desire to impose one's will
and den to the cosmos with it.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But rather than
a corrupted will,

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:47.150 align:middle line:84%
a desire to control others, what
governs despots and dictators,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't come from that.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It comes just from a
desire for aliveness,

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:84%
a desire for sentience, a
desire for sentience ungoverned

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.990 align:middle line:90%
by any constraint, so to speak.

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that just drives
and pushes me to no end.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.863 align:middle line:84%
And so now that we're kind
of getting into consciousness

00:22:05.863 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
now-- so this is
actually a pivot.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We're 30 minutes into
this one-hour session,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll do a Q&A. Isn't
it quickly how time flies?

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking a little
bit about technology,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and the speed of
innovation, and the fact

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.510 align:middle line:84%
that these tools are advancing
at the speed that they are.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And that the tools
to change the world

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.070 align:middle line:84%
are now in everybody's hands
from programmable biology

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
to synthetic biology, to smart
phones the size of blood cells,

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.030 align:middle line:84%
to nanobots in our
bodies and brains,

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.420 align:middle line:84%
to artificial intelligent
organisms, non-biological minds

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.245 align:middle line:84%
that can help us solve any
problem, billion-fold increases

00:22:41.245 --> 00:22:42.045 align:middle line:90%
in intelligence.

00:22:42.045 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all
the stuff that's

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:90%
happening in technology, right?

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.670 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
these technologies

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:48.470 align:middle line:90%
are stewarded by human minds.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And human minds
are really messy.

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So another one of the sort of
passions and interests of mine

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and of Steven's, ironically--
because again, these are

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
the videos, topics I explore.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:90%
These are the books he writes.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:90%
He wrote a book on technology.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.117 align:middle line:84%
He also wrote a book on
human performance and a book

00:23:03.117 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
on altered states and
existential desire

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
for transcendence.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So we live in a world now,
where in spite of our riches,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
in spite of our progress,
more people kill themselves

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:84%
than die from natural disasters
and armed conflict combined.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the United
Nations' number.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So that means our
own minds are more

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.120 align:middle line:84%
of a danger to us than
terrorism, and war,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and natural disasters,
and hurricanes.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Our own minds, right?

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Our own disquiet.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Depression and anxiety are
said to be at epidemic levels

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and yet, there is
radical progress

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.460 align:middle line:84%
in the fields of psychology,
technology, neurobiology,

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.610 align:middle line:84%
pharmacology, to look at
what's happening in our brains,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:84%
both in our agony
and in our ecstasy.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And so Steven is probably one
of the world's premier authors,

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:02.720 align:middle line:84%
thinkers, researchers, who
is putting the information

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
out there with
the rigor required

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
actually happening,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.800 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then
modulate, modify, potentially

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
improve ourselves away from
these pathological mind issues.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So, Steven, where do you
think we stand on the power?

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, why don't we talk a little
bit about the power of flow,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.745 align:middle line:84%
which is something that
you've written about,

00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:25.070 align:middle line:90%
I've made videos about.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.588 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the ideal
state of consciousness,

00:24:27.588 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and then let's talk about the
default state of consciousness.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And then let's talk
about how to get

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.650 align:middle line:84%
more of the ideal
state of consciousness.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So flow is a technical term.

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
It floats around in the zone,
runner's high, all that stuff.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.005 align:middle line:84%
Scientists define it
as a state of optimal--

00:24:44.005 --> 00:24:45.380 align:middle line:84%
an optimal state
of consciousness

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
where we perform our best
and we feel our best.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've all had the
experience, right?

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Flow is when you're so
focused on the task at hand

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.123 align:middle line:84%
that everything else
just vanishes, right?

00:24:55.123 --> 00:24:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Your sense of self
will disappear.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.780 align:middle line:90%
Time will pass strangely.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Occasionally, it'll slow down.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.800 align:middle line:90%
More frequently, it speeds up.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Five hours go by in
like five minutes.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And throughout all aspects
of even performance

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:90%
would go through the roof.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And flow science dates
back to the 1870s.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Frederick Nietzsche worked
on flow a little bit.

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:84%
The early studies on
flow date back there.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
William James worked on flow
at the turn of the century.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:84%
And back then what
was interesting is

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.253 align:middle line:90%
flow was not treated--

00:25:27.253 --> 00:25:28.920 align:middle line:84%
it was treated as a
mystical experience.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And when William James
wrote about flow,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.075 align:middle line:84%
he thought it was only
reserved for religious people

00:25:34.075 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual people.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it showed up.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And in the '50s, Abraham
Maslow came along.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And he was studying
peak experiences,

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:90%
which is another word for flow.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing this
huge study on success.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to know.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.240 align:middle line:84%
At this point,
psychology had sort of

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.540 align:middle line:84%
taken a weird turn with
Freud and was really focused

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:90%
on pathological problems.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And nobody was
interested in exploring

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.122 align:middle line:90%
psychological possibilities.

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Abraham Maslow came along
and said, no, no, I'm

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.905 align:middle line:84%
really interested in
success to do this giant--

00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:03.280 align:middle line:84%
first, he did a
historical study.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he did a study
of [INAUDIBLE] people.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Very successful-- Albert
Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Huge study.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And he found, A, all successful
people have found ways

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.400 align:middle line:84%
to alter their consciousness,
put themselves into flow,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.115 align:middle line:84%
and use this to drive
their creativity,

00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:18.880 align:middle line:90%
their innovation, their success.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And, B, everybody in the
study group was an atheist.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly,
spiritual experiences,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:24.850 align:middle line:90%
mystical experiences are out.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Peak experiences are in.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:84%
25 years later,
Csikszentmihalyi comes along.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
And he asks the more pedestrian
version of Maslow's question.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Maslow was, what do
all successful people

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:90%
have in common?

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Csikszentmihalyi said, no, no.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I just want to know
about everybody.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.960 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling our best,
when we're performing our best,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
what does everybody
else have in common?

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
He went around the world,
asking people this question.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.395 align:middle line:84%
And they all said
the same thing.

00:26:45.395 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in the
state, every decision,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.950 align:middle line:84%
every action flows seamlessly,
effortlessly, perfectly

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:90%
from the last.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.770 align:middle line:84%
So flow is a
phenomenological description.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.110 align:middle line:84%
It's how the state
makes us feel.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And what's
interesting about that

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is for every decision, every
action to flow seamlessly,

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:84%
perfectly, effortlessly
from the last,

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.790 align:middle line:84%
you have kind of a
shorthand definition

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
of what flow kind of is
under the hood, which

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is as close to high-speed,
near perfect decision-making

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.990 align:middle line:90%
as we can get.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I said as close to, not
perfect decision-making.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Scot Schmidt, one of the
early extreme skiers,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.450 align:middle line:84%
used to say flow makes
me feel like Superman,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.060 align:middle line:84%
up until the moment
I'm not, right?

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:90%
Word of caution on that one.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:25.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What's interesting about
flow is the numbers are all over

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:29.260 align:middle line:90%
the place.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But some studies have
found productivity goes up

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:90%
500%, creativity--

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.860 align:middle line:90%
200 to 400%.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And we understand kind
of the neurobiology

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.395 align:middle line:90%
underneath all of this.

00:27:40.395 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
What's really
getting interesting

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.470 align:middle line:90%
is neuroscience, biotechnology.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.590 align:middle line:84%
These are accelerating fields,
again, exponentially moving

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.460 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So when I started
this work in 1999,

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.090 align:middle line:84%
when I first started
doing flow research,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.145 align:middle line:84%
I remember being on the phone
with Dr. Andrew Newberg.

00:27:57.145 --> 00:27:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you guys
are familiar with him.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
He was the University
of Pennsylvania

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
neuroscientist who did the
first work on cosmic unity.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.580 align:middle line:84%
He took Tibetan,
Buddhist, and Franciscan

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.290 align:middle line:84%
nuns experiencing
oneness with everything

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:11.375 align:middle line:84%
and put them into an fMRI
and tried to figure out

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:12.250 align:middle line:90%
where that came from.

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, if you're
going to my talk tomorrow,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.220 align:middle line:84%
I will tell that story and talk
about where that came from.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:90%
We're going to ignore that.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Go to his talk
tomorrow, guys.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be awesome.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.693 align:middle line:84%
>> But I remember talking to
him about flow at the time.

00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
think in our lifetime

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.757 align:middle line:90%
we're ever going to decode this?

00:28:29.757 --> 00:28:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Are we going to figure this out?

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And both of us were sure
it would not happen.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And here we are--
couple decades later.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And the state of ultimate
human performance-- we

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
are now starting
to pick it apart.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.145 align:middle line:84%
We understand what
it does to the brain.

00:28:43.145 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
We understand what it
does to the physiology.

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:45.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not all the way there.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And there's huge
gaps in the research

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.130 align:middle line:90%
we can drive buses through.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But this is ultimate
even performance

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:90%
that we're being able to decode.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, when I
think about flow,

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I would go as far as-- once
I understood what flow was

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and then I kind of retroactively
looked back on my own life,

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
every significant moment in my
life, those archived memories,

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
those bookmarked moments
were flooded by flow, right?

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.720 align:middle line:84%
You feel your best, and
you perform your best.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
When you say near-perfect
decision-making,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that's when that really
resonated with me

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.160 align:middle line:84%
in terms of when I make my
videos, which are not scripted.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
They're very much freestyle,
or stream of consciousness,

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.953 align:middle line:84%
or like following a
butterfly effect in thought.

00:29:31.953 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
about the notion

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.180 align:middle line:84%
of near-perfect decision-making,
when you're having a riff,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.378 align:middle line:90%
you're having a download.

00:29:38.378 --> 00:29:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You're having one of those
moments where it comes

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.570 align:middle line:90%
through you, but not from you.

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.487 align:middle line:84%
And though it is with
you, belongs not to you.

00:29:43.487 --> 00:29:47.230 align:middle line:84%
You're a vessel like the
freestyle rapper or the jazz

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:90%
musician.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.692 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,

00:29:50.692 --> 00:29:51.492 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:51.492 --> 00:29:53.260 align:middle line:84%
The part-- the
self-editor in the brain,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the part that second
guesses and tells you no.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:90%
That goes quiet.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like you
get out of your own way.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a metaphor.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.550 align:middle line:84%
You literally step
aside from yourself.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But the near-perfect
decision-making part

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is the part of
you that is seeing

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.570 align:middle line:84%
how all the right
words are emerging

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
at just the right moment
like the movie, "Limitless,"

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.190 align:middle line:90%
when the guy takes that drug.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's just like your pattern
recognition ability go up.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.190 align:middle line:84%
But you're at just
the right speed

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:84%
that you can surf
what's happening.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So if ordinary life
is kind of flat water,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:84%
flow is like the perfect wave
that you can surf, not so

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:33.830 align:middle line:90%
much that you're wiping out.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's just-- and you're
making just the right decisions

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.120 align:middle line:84%
to stay perfectly on the wave
and deliver the perfect riff,

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:90%
whatever that performance is.

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're also
really enjoying it.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:90%
You're witnessing it happening.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
You're witnessing yourself
letting it go through you.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's absolutely
exhilarating.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And then if you're smart
enough or lucky enough

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
to have that be happening
in a context of music,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.940 align:middle line:84%
or freestyle, or writing, so
that it's getting transcribed,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.327 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
experience is over--

00:31:05.327 --> 00:31:07.160 align:middle line:84%
because again, it's a
transitory experience.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:90%
But then you have evidence.

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You have a concrete thing
that came out of you, that you

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.152 align:middle line:90%
had to put in a drawer.

00:31:13.152 --> 00:31:15.485 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the most
deeply satisfying experiences

00:31:15.485 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I've taken ephemeral
ecstasy, and I've bottled it.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.353 align:middle line:84%
I've put a cloak around it, and
that's absolutely exhilarating.

00:31:25.353 --> 00:31:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's like-- you
said once that people

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
who discover how to get flow,
build their lives around it.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And those that build
their lives around it

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.050 align:middle line:84%
report the highest levels of
life satisfaction of any group,

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, which is very true.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:40.530 align:middle line:84%
It's worth taking that one step
back, because it's more useful.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So what we've discovered over
the past 10 years, 12 years--

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.993 align:middle line:84%
and I've been involved
in this research.

00:31:48.993 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:84%
A lot of other people have
been involved in this research.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But we figured out
that flow states

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:84%
have triggers, pre-conditions
that lead to more flow.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you
who speak science,

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:84%
the triggers do one
of two things, really.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.442 align:middle line:84%
They either drive norepinephrine
and dopamine into the brain,

00:32:04.442 --> 00:32:05.650 align:middle line:90%
which are focusing chemicals.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So what they do
is drive attention

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:08.810 align:middle line:90%
into the present moment.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Or they lower
cognitive load, which

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
means all the shit you're
trying to think about at once--

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.390 align:middle line:90%
that kind of dials back.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:15.485 align:middle line:90%
And again, same effect.

00:32:15.485 --> 00:32:17.360 align:middle line:84%
You get to pay more
attention to the present.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The flow only shows up
when all our attention

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
is right here, right now.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.180 align:middle line:90%
Very task focused.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:27.050 align:middle line:84%
So what has happened is we now
know that those states have

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.960 align:middle line:90%
20, 21, 22 different triggers.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's probably
way more, but that's

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.310 align:middle line:90%
what we've discovered so far.

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So the people who are
really good at this

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and are people who basically
have built their lives

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.720 align:middle line:90%
around all of these triggers--

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.280 align:middle line:90%
you've done it inadvertently.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.697 align:middle line:84%
And that's actually like--
this leads me to an interesting

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:90%
question, which is--

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.340 align:middle line:84%
so if you read "Stealing
Fire" from me with that book,

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:53.870 align:middle line:84%
at one point in the chapter
on flow, we write about Jason.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And we wrote about his
early childhood experiences

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in Venezuela and using
freestyle philosophy as a way

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:06.696 align:middle line:84%
to kind of fight PTSD of growing
up in a tragic situation.

00:33:06.696 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:84%
So you were already
flow hacking back then.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
What I want to know is, what
were you doing back then?

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:90%
And how has it changed to now?

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:16.800 align:middle line:84%
How has your process changed
in terms of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like being
present is very hard for me.

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.110 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.430 align:middle line:90%
I've tried meditation and yoga.

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And my girlfriend is a
meditator and a yogi.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.710 align:middle line:84%
That might work for some
people if you try really hard,

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:41.470 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a smooth entry
into the present or into flow.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Michael Pollan's book,
"How to Change your Mind--"

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:90%
in the preface of the book--

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.770 align:middle line:84%
describes kind of the
default human condition.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Here I thought I was the only
one struggling with this.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.820 align:middle line:84%
He says the brain is kind of
an artificial intelligence

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:58.720 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It takes in data
from the present,

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.160 align:middle line:84%
compares that with
data from the past

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.570 align:middle line:84%
and uses that to
predict the future.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.139 align:middle line:84%
The brain is essentially
a prediction machine.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing
that to protect you

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:84%
from something unexpected
going around the bend.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You're mitigating
against future risk.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, thinking of
and planning for the future

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
also is responsible for
us being so successful.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So being in the present all the
time also means you get eaten.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.989 align:middle line:84%
Because the tiger behind
you comes running.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.219 align:middle line:84%
And you never saw it
coming, because you

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:84%
were busy looking at the
flower that was so beautiful,

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:90%
so there's a reason for that.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he says
that our default

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is one of living in a
perpetual future tense

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.739 align:middle line:84%
with a low level of anxiety
that's always present.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And the good news is
I'm seldom surprised.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.110 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is I'm
seldom surprised.

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he says that
one of the things

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:55.210 align:middle line:84%
that commends
travel, art, beauty,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.250 align:middle line:90%
and certain kinds of drugs--

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.410 align:middle line:90%
in my case, cannabis--

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.450 align:middle line:84%
is that these experiences
block all signals,

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:90%
forwards and backwards, right?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's the comparing this
with the past and predicting.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:84%
They just block, throwing you
into the present or the flow.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.940 align:middle line:84%
He writes the word
the flow, of a present

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that is literally wonder full--

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.560 align:middle line:90%
full of wonder.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Wonder being the byproduct
of exactly that unencumbered

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.950 align:middle line:84%
sense of first sight or
virginal noticing to which

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
the adult mind
has closed itself.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually by inhibiting
our brains' capacity

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.770 align:middle line:84%
to be pre-mapping the
future or living in or using

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.500 align:middle line:84%
the past to taint what's
happening, to over-determine

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.810 align:middle line:84%
what's happening
by inhibiting that,

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.420 align:middle line:84%
by actually constraining
that capacity.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
In pot, they call it the messing
with your short-term memory.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It actually ends up
being a good thing.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because it offers us temporary
relief from a faculty

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that evolved to keep
us safe, so to speak.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And we can finally become
innocent bystanders

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.290 align:middle line:90%
in the present.

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:90%
We can be as children.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And that infuses the world
with a sense of wonder.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And then anything that enters
our field of consciousness

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.010 align:middle line:84%
in that moment of
hyper-presence--

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:84%
God, it becomes rich
material for engagement.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in nature, if
you're among friends you love,

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.150 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing them as
if for the first time.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.390 align:middle line:84%
You're engaging with them
with that childlike curiosity.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.090 align:middle line:84%
You can experience them
and contemplate them

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:90%
all at the same time.

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.045 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that
creates euphoria

00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and probably because
it's an experience

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.340 align:middle line:90%
I have so few and far between.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I get euphoric when I
find myself in that state.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.640 align:middle line:90%
I respond to it with euphoria.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.570 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like getting into
a hot bath when you're cold.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:52.757 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing for like 15 or 20
minutes, and then you're tired.

00:36:52.757 --> 00:36:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
get out of the bath.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But I have built my whole
life around those 45 minutes

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of pleasure when I
step into that flow.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I have my
gear, my camera,

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.760 align:middle line:84%
and my whatever for
when I'm on my way

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
down to describe
what transpired.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.830 align:middle line:84%
That's my entire
creative process A to Z.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And that started in high school,
posting salons with my buddies

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and getting high.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.615 align:middle line:84%
We were inspired by Charles
Baudelaire's hashish parties

00:37:20.615 --> 00:37:22.990 align:middle line:84%
from the 1920s, when all these
artisan philosophers would

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:28.810 align:middle line:84%
sit around and smoke hash
and then see what transpired.

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Creative process is the same.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.805 align:middle line:84%
I just have a little
more resources now

00:37:32.805 --> 00:37:37.253 align:middle line:84%
to create contexts in situations
to hurl me into the present.

00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:39.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.560 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting-- one of the
things that sort of caught me--

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.830 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that's
going on in 3D printing

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.800 align:middle line:84%
is they're starting to play
with 3D chemical printers.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.662 align:middle line:90%
So all kinds of--

00:37:53.662 --> 00:37:55.620 align:middle line:84%
when you were talking,
what popped into my head

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.850 align:middle line:84%
was how much substances--
marijuana psychedelics have

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.090 align:middle line:84%
actually tilted culture,
have changed it,

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:90%
have created so much art.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.280 align:middle line:84%
We're about to get to the point
where we can 3D print chemicals

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:90%
in our homes, right?

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Where it's starting out
with prescription drugs.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to go
to the drug store,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.610 align:middle line:84%
but we're obviously going
to be able to hack them.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're obviously
going to be able to start

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to do levels of
consciousness-altering

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:22.650 align:middle line:84%
substance
experimentation at home.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.710 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, so it's better.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we getting 3D
chem printers, but both AI

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.495 align:middle line:84%
and quantum computing,
which is going

00:38:32.495 --> 00:38:34.620 align:middle line:84%
to start to come online
over the next couple years.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:37.755 align:middle line:84%
The low-hanging fruit in quantum
computing is drug discovery.

00:38:37.755 --> 00:38:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's
already-- by the way,

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.530 align:middle line:90%
we're getting computing.com.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Go there.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.928 align:middle line:84%
You can play with a quantum
computer online for free today.

00:38:44.928 --> 00:38:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You can go home and play with
a quantum computer, which

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.050 align:middle line:90%
is the craziest thought ever.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But once these things
start to get more powerful,

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.090 align:middle line:84%
drug discovery is what
they're best suited for.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the low-hanging fruit.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.130 align:middle line:84%
So AIs, quantum computers
with user-friendly interfaces

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
doing drug discovery and 3D
chem printers in our house.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is not just
a psychedelic explorer.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is a
psychedelic chemist.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about the
really limited pharmacopoeia

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.830 align:middle line:84%
that we've had to pick from over
the past couple thousand years

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:19.380 align:middle line:84%
and accelerated the
past couple hundred--

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Alexander Shulgin,
for example, who

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:22.655 align:middle line:84%
we write about in
"Stealing Fire" who's

00:39:22.655 --> 00:39:27.330 align:middle line:84%
lauded as a pioneer, invented
200 substances of which people

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.880 align:middle line:90%
use 7 to 10 of them, right?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is up-- within 10
years-- we all get to 15 years.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We all get to play
that game if we want to

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:84%
and what it's going
to do for imagination.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all probably
going to blow ourselves up.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be Woodstock
inverted, right?

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But the research is
going to get interesting.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.730 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm curious, Steven.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:58.350 align:middle line:84%
You once wrote that
flow saved your life.

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.210 align:middle line:90%
You had Lyme disease.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.815 align:middle line:90%
You were in a dark period.

00:40:01.815 --> 00:40:05.190 align:middle line:84%
And flow through surfing,
I believe you said,

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:90%
saved your life.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little bit
about how flow saved your life?

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.590 align:middle line:90%
And also, what your--

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.500 align:middle line:84%
some of those most
effective and reliable flow

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:25.170 align:middle line:84%
triggers and some
tips and tricks for us

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:30.960 align:middle line:84%
to manage flow cycles,
flow crashes, hangovers,

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.030 align:middle line:84%
like the one I'm going
to have after this talk

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:34.387 align:middle line:90%
from the amount of focus--

00:40:34.387 --> 00:40:35.220 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:90%
--pattern recognition.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.880 align:middle line:90%
>> You'll be fine.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:44.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Why sleep is so important
for recovery and replenishment.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Just, I guess, body maintenance
for optimum flow in one's

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:51.800 align:middle line:90%
life without getting burnt out.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to do a lot of
the flow hacking tomorrow,

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:55.760 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to try to stir
around some of that stuff.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>> The story--

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Tease it.

00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The story Jason is referring to,
which I won't tell tomorrow--

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.880 align:middle line:84%
when I was 30 years
old, I got Lyme disease,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.050 align:middle line:90%
and I spent three years in bed.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.917 align:middle line:90%
And I was done.

00:41:08.917 --> 00:41:10.250 align:middle line:90%
The doctors pulled me off drugs.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:84%
My stomach lining
was bleeding out.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.890 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing anybody
else could do for me.

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- so if you're
not familiar what Lyme feels

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:19.340 align:middle line:84%
like on the inside, it's like
the worst flu you've ever had,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.770 align:middle line:84%
crossed with paranoid
schizophrenia.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:24.608 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
misdiagnosis for Lyme

00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:26.150 align:middle line:84%
is paranoid
schizophrenia, because it

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.025 align:middle line:90%
gets into your brain.

00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It massively [AUDIO OUT]
up your brain.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So my short-term
memory was gone.

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.770 align:middle line:90%
My long-term memory was gone.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if I met you
before the age of 30,

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.320 align:middle line:84%
I probably don't
know you anymore.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.720 align:middle line:90%
Most of that has been wiped.

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't drive because I
would get to a red light.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.850 align:middle line:84%
It would change to
green, and I would forget

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.110 align:middle line:90%
what a green light meant.

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:90%
So I'd be sitting in LA traffic.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is honking
at me, and I can't move.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And after about three-- and I
couldn't walk across the room.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.020 align:middle line:90%
I was so sick.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And after about three years
of this, a friend of mine

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.828 align:middle line:90%
showed up at my house.

00:41:54.828 --> 00:41:56.120 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to kill myself.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.328 align:middle line:84%
I had already-- I had sleeping
pills in the bathroom.

00:41:58.328 --> 00:41:59.780 align:middle line:90%
It was just a question of when.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't-- and I
was massively depressed.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But I was just
going to be a burden

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:03.990 align:middle line:90%
to my friends and my family.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I was bankrupt.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I lost the woman I
was going to marry.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I lost the job I spent
10 years trying to get.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:08.630 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that normal
for Lyme disease?

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
>> If it goes
undetected, which--

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --this was-- I got it before
Lyme had creeped to California.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So nobody believed it
was Lyme in California.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It took me forever
to get diagnosed.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of
this, a friend of mine

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.180 align:middle line:90%
shows up at my door.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.470 align:middle line:84%
And she demands
that we go surfing.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I literally
can't walk to you.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.902 align:middle line:90%
And it's hysterical.

00:42:32.902 --> 00:42:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And she won't leave,
and she won't leave.

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And she keeps badgering me.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And she keeps badgering me
and won't leave my apartment.

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And after hours of
it, it was like,

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:90%
I can kill myself tomorrow.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Just anything to
get her to shut up.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:44.030 align:middle line:90%
Please.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And they sort of had
to carry me to the car.

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And they drove me
to Sunset Beach,

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.668 align:middle line:84%
which if you guys
surf here in LA,

00:42:51.668 --> 00:42:53.210 align:middle line:84%
you know that's the
wimpiest beginner

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.100 align:middle line:90%
wave in the entire world.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:56.100 align:middle line:90%
And it was a summer day.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So the waves were really
low, and it was warm.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me a board
the size of a Cadillac.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger the board,
the easier it is to surf.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And they literally
had to take my elbows

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:04.258 align:middle line:90%
and walk me out to the break.

00:43:04.258 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was out there 30 seconds.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And muscle memory isn't
actually a real thing,

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.403 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to use the term.

00:43:10.403 --> 00:43:11.570 align:middle line:90%
But muscle memory took over.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:12.260 align:middle line:90%
A wave came.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.190 align:middle line:90%
And I spun my board.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And I pedaled a couple times,
and I popped up my feet.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.057 align:middle line:84%
And I popped up to a
dimension that I didn't even

00:43:18.057 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:90%
know existed, right?

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm a science guy.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't have
mystical experiences.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I certainly don't have
them while surfing.

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What is flakier than that?

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I felt
like I could see out

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:29.180 align:middle line:84%
of the back of my head,
and time slowed down.

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.818 align:middle line:84%
And the best part-- the most
amazing part was I felt good.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I hadn't felt good in--

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:35.180 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what good
even felt like anymore.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, I felt that good.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:37.970 align:middle line:90%
All the pain was gone.

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:39.380 align:middle line:90%
I was clear headed.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.930 align:middle line:90%
And that wave felt so good.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I caught four more.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And after five waves,
I was disassembled.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:45.410 align:middle line:90%
They drove me home.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.238 align:middle line:90%
They put me in bed.

00:43:46.238 --> 00:43:48.530 align:middle line:84%
People had to bring me food
for like 15 days, because I

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.572 align:middle line:84%
couldn't walk to my kitchen
to make a meal, which

00:43:50.572 --> 00:43:52.400 align:middle line:90%
was like 25 feet away.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.670 align:middle line:84%
And on the 15th day, which was
the day I could walk again,

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.610 align:middle line:84%
I caught a ride back to the
beach, and I did it again.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And over the course
of about eight months

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.750 align:middle line:84%
when the only thing I was
doing differently in my life

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:04.582 align:middle line:84%
was surfing and having
these really crazy,

00:44:04.582 --> 00:44:06.290 align:middle line:84%
altered state experiences
that I now know

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:08.420 align:middle line:90%
are flow states, my life--

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:84%
I went from 10% functional
and suicidal to about 80%

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.570 align:middle line:90%
functional and on my way back.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And my first question was, OK,
what the hell just happened?

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Because surfing is
not a known cure

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.120 align:middle line:84%
for chronic autoimmune
conditions, point A. And point

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.520 align:middle line:84%
B, Lyme is only fatal if
it gets into your brain.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And I was really sure
that the only reason

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.078 align:middle line:84%
I was having these mystical
experiences in the waves

00:44:30.078 --> 00:44:31.370 align:middle line:90%
was because it was in my brain.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:32.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was happening.

00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to die
very, very shortly, which

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:36.838 align:middle line:90%
was a very strange situation.

00:44:36.838 --> 00:44:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So I lit out on a giant
quest to figure out

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:39.838 align:middle line:90%
what the hell happened to me.

00:44:39.838 --> 00:44:41.780 align:middle line:90%
And what I quickly learned--

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:90%
not quickly.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.910 align:middle line:90%
It took years.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.250 align:middle line:84%
But Herb Benson,
cardiologist at Harvard,

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.900 align:middle line:90%
did a lot of this work.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
He mapped the neurochemical
cycle underneath flow.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And what he pointed out is
that when we go into flow,

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:90%
you reset the nervous system.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So Lyme disease-- any
autoimmune condition

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:84%
is a nervous system
gone haywire.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you go
into flow, there's

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:07.160 align:middle line:84%
a global release of a
chemical called nitrous oxide.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And it basically throws
all the stress hormones out

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:13.865 align:middle line:84%
of your system and fills you
with feel-good neurochemistry.

00:45:13.865 --> 00:45:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Create nitrous oxide?

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:90%
That gas is a single molecule.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.670 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere in your body.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:84%
They're not in a lot of gases--
small molecules in the body.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.350 align:middle line:90%
But that's one of them.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:25.400 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, we're geeks.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.890 align:middle line:84%
But all those neurochemicals
besides resetting

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the immune system, which is
amazingly powerful if you

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:90%
have an autoimmune condition.

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.425 align:middle line:84%
And Herb Benson
has gone so far as

00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:38.300 align:middle line:84%
to say he thinks this
is the mechanism that's

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:84%
underneath most so-called
cases of spontaneous healing.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's either placebo
effect or flow

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.300 align:middle line:84%
that's pretty much
producing that as

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.325 align:middle line:90%
far as science can tell.

00:45:46.325 --> 00:45:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there might
be other explanations.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.740 align:middle line:84%
But from a scientific
perspective,

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.306 align:middle line:90%
that's what we know.

00:45:51.306 --> 00:45:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is all
those neurochemicals massively

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:55.515 align:middle line:90%
boost the immune system.

00:45:55.515 --> 00:45:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're resetting
the nervous system.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.490 align:middle line:84%
You're massively boosting
the immune system.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And over a period
of time, I went--

00:46:02.535 --> 00:46:03.410 align:middle line:90%
I got back to health.

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's the story
he's referring to.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
second part of that.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:09.570 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:10.060 align:middle line:90%
Where did--

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No, just--

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.857 align:middle line:90%
>> --you go with that?

00:46:11.857 --> 00:46:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] that
flow also has a price,

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you have flow cycles,
and that these experiences can

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.330 align:middle line:90%
be addicting.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:84%
You could say that flow is the
most addictive state on Earth.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, how
do you work around it?

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.160 align:middle line:84%
How do you mitigate
the crash from flow?

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.010 align:middle line:90%
How do you rest and recuperate?

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:35.950 align:middle line:90%
And how do you avoid crashing?

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, what's the role
of sleep in recuperating?

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, what's the
quickest shortcut to flow?

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You once called it
the hippie speed ball,

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.730 align:middle line:84%
which was 20 minutes of aerobic
exercise, a shot of espresso,

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and a joint.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:47.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Sativa.

00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:48.550 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be sativa.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You need dopamine
on the front end.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:50.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Sativa.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:50.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.608 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, he's right.

00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Mimics all of the
neurochemcals or a lot of them.

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.300 align:middle line:90%
It's very close to flow.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.090 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
sleep, cause sleep--

00:46:59.090 --> 00:46:59.890 align:middle line:90%
so let's first--

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.948 align:middle line:84%
>> My friends make fun of me for
how much I treasure my sleep.

00:47:02.948 --> 00:47:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, but you and I are
the-- we're the same way

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.990 align:middle line:90%
and for the same reason.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
what he's referring to,

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.833 align:middle line:90%
so you guys can understand it.

00:47:09.833 --> 00:47:11.250 align:middle line:84%
He's not kidding
when he says flow

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.230 align:middle line:84%
is the most addictive state
on Earth neurochemically.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So we have endogenous
neurochemicals.

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:18.460 align:middle line:90%
We make endorphins.

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:20.380 align:middle line:90%
And we have exogenous chemicals.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:90%
Opiates are endorphins, right?

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:90%
We make our own version of them.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And to put it in
perspective, there

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:29.240 align:middle line:84%
are about 20 different
endorphins in the body.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:84%
The most common one is a
hundred times more potent

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.460 align:middle line:90%
than medical morphine.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine is cocaine.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And literally, when
people snort cocaine,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.600 align:middle line:84%
the most addictive substance
on Earth, all that happens

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.030 align:middle line:90%
is the brain releases dopamine.

00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:46.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a signaling molecule,
and it blocks its reuptake.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin, which also
shows up in flow,

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.350 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
pathway it takes,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.105 align:middle line:90%
it's either MDMA or ecstasy.

00:47:52.105 --> 00:47:54.715 align:middle line:84%
You get norepinephrine,
and that is crystal meth.

00:47:54.715 --> 00:47:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's one methyl chain
away from a crystal meth.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.430 align:middle line:84%
Street speed is the
natural version.

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't-- and anandamide,
which is the same psychoactive

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.623 align:middle line:84%
that shows up in marijuana--
it's what THC releases

00:48:05.623 --> 00:48:06.820 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.280 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't cocktail
those drugs on the street.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.700 align:middle line:90%
You'd end up in a coma.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:11.500 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't work.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.455 align:middle line:84%
You actually can't-- cocaine
and ecstasy won't work together.

00:48:14.455 --> 00:48:15.580 align:middle line:90%
They cancel each other out.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So you couldn't even
do it if you tried.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Flow does it naturally.

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the most potent
chemical anywhere.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Just to put it in comparison,
romantic love-- and we

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.860 align:middle line:90%
all know how good that feels.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.910 align:middle line:90%
That's two chemicals.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.710 align:middle line:84%
That's norepinephrine
and dopamine.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Flow is five of these
chemicals-- most

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:33.100 align:middle line:90%
addictive state on Earth.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.900 align:middle line:90%
And what we've learned--

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.060 align:middle line:84%
this is, again, Herbert
Benson's work at Harvard,

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who did the
foundational work, is we

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.790 align:middle line:90%
used to think flow is a binary.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.070 align:middle line:84%
You're in the zone, you're
not, you're out of the zone.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And we now know it
doesn't work like that.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a four-stage cycle.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And you have to move all
the way through all stages.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.383 align:middle line:84%
But once a month or so,
somebody comes up to me

00:48:50.383 --> 00:48:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and says, oh, Steven,
you've got to study me.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm in flow all the time.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.604 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:54.604 --> 00:48:54.933 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.933 --> 00:48:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning when
that used to happen to me,

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.510 align:middle line:84%
I'd be like, oh, I
don't know if I should

00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.552 align:middle line:90%
tell this dude the truth.

00:48:59.552 --> 00:49:00.700 align:middle line:90%
But now, I just say it.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, we have
a word for that.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:03.940 align:middle line:90%
We call that schizophrenia.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.600 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.670 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.017 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to actually
live in flow all the time.

00:49:09.017 --> 00:49:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So anybody who's
running around going,

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.060 align:middle line:84%
dude, I'm in flow
all the time, yeah,

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you're a manic depressive who
should probably see a doctor.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.610 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
when we go into flow,

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.250 align:middle line:84%
it is a neural chemically
expensive state.

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And these chemicals are
short lived-- some of them.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.250 align:middle line:84%
Norepinephrine and dopamine,
the romantic love chemicals,

00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.110 align:middle line:84%
are also your main
focusing chemicals.

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.178 align:middle line:84%
Why are TED Talks
20 minutes long?

00:49:34.178 --> 00:49:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Because they last about
20 minutes in your brain.

00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.457 align:middle line:84%
That's how long we can
focus really intensely,

00:49:38.457 --> 00:49:39.790 align:middle line:90%
and then it starts to fade away.

00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:40.750 align:middle line:90%
We've all had this experience.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.250 align:middle line:84%
You see in the
"James Bond" movie.

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Everything blows up for
the first 20 minutes.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And then you're bored for
the next hour and a half.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.550 align:middle line:84%
You're bored because
those explosions

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.680 align:middle line:84%
have stolen all your
dopamine and norepinephrine.

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can no
longer focus at all.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what's going
on in your brain.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So on the back end
of a flow state,

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:59.410 align:middle line:84%
big, high,
neurochemically expensive.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.090 align:middle line:90%
There's a crash, right?

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a recovery phase.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I think--
and other scientists

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and researchers have
kind of pointed at this.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:10.660 align:middle line:90%
We need much more experiments.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:90%
But flow is a really big high.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said it was near perfect,
not perfect decision-making.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.600 align:middle line:90%
It's followed by a deep low.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.600 align:middle line:84%
This may actually be
a refractory period.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.250 align:middle line:90%
You had all these great ideas.

00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And now, you get to look
at them very, very soberly.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:26.410 align:middle line:90%
I love-- I like writing in flow.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:28.010 align:middle line:90%
I love editing on the back end.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Because if I like what I
wrote on the back end of it,

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I've got no more
feel-good neurochemistry.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Shit's got to be good, because
I'm grumpy as hell, right?

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So it works to your benefit
if you know how to use it.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:41.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's why.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:43.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that works for
when I do my videos, too.

00:50:43.392 --> 00:50:44.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's why sleep is so--

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:44.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got a certain--

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --important.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> --level of peak flow.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I sometimes
record then.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes I record a
little bit in the afterglow.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Before, I fully crashed.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:55.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm already kind of
starting to wind down, because--

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:56.493 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:50:56.493 --> 00:50:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll watch them
when I'm completely done.

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:00.370 align:middle line:90%
>> You want more flow?

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.200 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the worst
things you can do.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you why.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So we've all had
this experience.

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:06.765 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:06.765 --> 00:51:07.128 align:middle line:90%


00:51:07.128 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:84%
You get into a flow state,
and your ideas are spinning.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And you're like, oh, my God.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.610 align:middle line:90%
I've accessed all these ideas.

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to follow them
out-- every last little one.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to catch all of them.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're greedy
for those ideas.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
by chasing them out,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.020 align:middle line:84%
you're exhausting
all your dopamine,

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and you have nothing
to build with.

00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.700 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.867 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had that experience.

00:51:25.867 --> 00:51:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> --this is why Hemingway--
and I learned it from Gabriel

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:29.750 align:middle line:90%
García Márquez.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.960 align:middle line:84%
But both Hemingway and Márquez
taught writers to quit when

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.310 align:middle line:90%
you're most excited.

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
How do you get up and write
the best the next day?

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Quit while you're most excited.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:42.810 align:middle line:84%
Usually by the time you've
noticed you're most excited,

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:44.670 align:middle line:84%
it's on the tail
end of a flow state,

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to be-- you're
moving downhill from there.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.170 align:middle line:90%
So I sort of do the same thing.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.030 align:middle line:84%
I get to a certain
point now in flow.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is really spiraling
where I decide I cut it off.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.260 align:middle line:90%
I do something intentionally.

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll do something that
I never really do,

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:59.850 align:middle line:84%
like I'll watch television
to just like-- it will

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.480 align:middle line:90%
stop my brain from doing that.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I don't
want to exhaust it,

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
because I need more
flow the next day.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm a creative, and
I have to write every day.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.263 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's how
I've messed with it.

00:52:09.263 --> 00:52:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So those are some
tips and tricks.

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, one other
thing about sleep.

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is obviously
foundational for recovery,

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.870 align:middle line:90%
and you can't cheat it, right?

00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Study after study shows we need
seven to eight hours a night.

00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:24.300 align:middle line:90%
There's no real way around it.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody really does better with
less for long periods of time.

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:30.662 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, if you
don't have enough sleep,

00:52:30.662 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it's really difficult
to get in the flow,

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:34.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
high-energy state.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:38.040 align:middle line:84%
So you need lots of sleep to
maintain the focus, right?

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.740 align:middle line:84%
To have specific focus
is expensive to do.

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.332 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't
like to do it a lot.

00:52:43.332 --> 00:52:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That makes a lot of sense.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.170 align:middle line:90%
That's why I treasure my sleep.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's flow.

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn to
master flow, that's

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.920 align:middle line:84%
a great tool in
our toolkit that we

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.830 align:middle line:84%
can leverage to boost
performance and make better

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:02.010 align:middle line:84%
decisions, so that we can use
these tools and technologies we

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.750 align:middle line:84%
were talking before to impact
the world in a positive way,

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.800 align:middle line:90%
because we are the gods now.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to talk a
little bit about what's

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:10.560 align:middle line:84%
happening with kind of
psychedelic research

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.730 align:middle line:90%
for healing ourselves.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.255 align:middle line:90%
So people are dying from trauma.

00:53:15.255 --> 00:53:16.380 align:middle line:90%
They're killing themselves.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.140 align:middle line:84%
PTSD people have very
high suicide rates,

00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.160 align:middle line:90%
depression, anxiety.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.950 align:middle line:84%
People have treatment-resistant
depression and anxiety.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.888 align:middle line:90%
People are a mess.

00:53:23.888 --> 00:53:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And some of the most interesting
research happening right now

00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:30.090 align:middle line:84%
at places like Imperial College
of London, Johns Hopkins

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:33.110 align:middle line:84%
University, NYU,
and other places

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:35.613 align:middle line:84%
are they're creating these
controlled environments.

00:53:35.613 --> 00:53:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're bringing people with
treatment-resistant depression,

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.740 align:middle line:90%
end of life, anxiety, PTSD.

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And they're deploying these
ecstatic technologies.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.690 align:middle line:90%
They're using things like MDMA.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.400 align:middle line:84%
They're using things
like psilocybin

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:48.960 align:middle line:90%
from magic mushrooms.

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And in a very safe container,
they're essentially

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.050 align:middle line:90%
inducing a mystical experience.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, a mystical experience
has to meet certain criteria,

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.850 align:middle line:84%
according to William
James, the psychologist who

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.380 align:middle line:84%
first created the questionnaire
of a mystical experience.

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting
is that it's not

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry of
the drugs themselves

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.000 align:middle line:84%
that seems to be responsible
for the healing that occurs,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.940 align:middle line:84%
but it's the experience
that they can occasion.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So if a person has a full-on
mystical experience that

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.652 align:middle line:84%
meets all the criteria, a
sense of interconnectedness,

00:54:19.652 --> 00:54:22.740 align:middle line:84%
a sense of transcendence
of time and space,

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.530 align:middle line:84%
a sense of deep well being,
a sense of noetic truth

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.800 align:middle line:84%
like a deeper spiritual
truth and day-to-day reality,

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:30.690 align:middle line:84%
a sense of
paradoxicality where they

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:32.485 align:middle line:84%
can hold multiple
truths in mind at once,

00:54:32.485 --> 00:54:34.860 align:middle line:84%
a sense that they transcend
their ego-- all these things.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.500 align:middle line:84%
If you have all those things,
if the contents of consciousness

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:41.190 align:middle line:84%
play out and you have this
experience, this ego death,

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.980 align:middle line:84%
this transcendence of
self, whatever that may be,

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:47.640 align:middle line:84%
when you come out on
the other side of that,

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.040 align:middle line:84%
enormously large
percentage of the people

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.490 align:middle line:84%
no longer meet the
criteria for PTSD,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.050 align:middle line:90%
or depression, or anxiety.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.940 align:middle line:84%
A single psilocybin
trip can cure

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:84%
somebody of multi-year
treatment-resistant depression.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:84%
A single-- I think two
or three MDMA sessions--

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:08.700 align:middle line:84%
80% of the patients no longer
met the criteria for PTSD.

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:11.520 align:middle line:84%
The head researcher at
Johns Hopkins University

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.710 align:middle line:84%
likened these
mystical experience

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.920 align:middle line:90%
as a kind of inverse PTSD.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you think of us as
the sum of our experiences

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.050 align:middle line:84%
or ourselves as the technology
that turns experience

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:29.160 align:middle line:84%
into biology, we are
what happens to us.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And so of course, trauma is
embedded in your physiology.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.380 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a lens of perception.

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a past that doesn't
stay in the past.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And you bring it with you to
every moment-- your traumas,

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.240 align:middle line:90%
your fears.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.990 align:middle line:84%
But an experience
of outrageous beauty

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.050 align:middle line:90%
can do the inverse of that.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.540 align:middle line:84%
An experience of mystical
rapture, poetic reveries,

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.540 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The ontological truth
of these experiences

00:55:55.770 --> 00:56:00.270 align:middle line:84%
matters less if the experience
is meaningful to you,

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.990 align:middle line:84%
meaningful enough to feel like
you have gone above and beyond

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.090 align:middle line:90%
that which ailed you before.

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Then it's a kind of inverse
PTSD that actually can heal us.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And people-- and there's
all this research, also,

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.710 align:middle line:84%
on awe coming out of Berkeley
and all these other places.

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think profound
cosmic awe is also

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:22.510 align:middle line:84%
something people experience
when they have psychedelic trips

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:23.890 align:middle line:90%
that are positive.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.733 align:middle line:84%
And awe is an experience of
such perceptual expansion

00:56:26.733 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that your mental
models of reality

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.120 align:middle line:84%
need to be upended to fit
in this new information,

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.930 align:middle line:84%
to make space now for this
new truth, so to speak.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And that when you have
experiences of awe,

00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:42.010 align:middle line:84%
once they're over, you're left
with increased feelings of well

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.690 align:middle line:84%
being, increased
feelings of compassion,

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:45.670 align:middle line:84%
and increased feelings
of creativity.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And the experience is
anti-inflammatory in your body

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.040 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So this notion of deploying
these ecstatic technologies

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:55.180 align:middle line:84%
in controlled,
responsible environments

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:57.580 align:middle line:90%
and inducing these--

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.480 align:middle line:90%
put a cord around it.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual experiences
heals people.

00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm less interested in
the veracity of what occurred

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.390 align:middle line:90%
inside the person's mind.

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Christians will see Jesus.

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.750 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists will see Buddha.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Nature lovers will see
the sacredness of nature.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.680 align:middle line:84%
The wallpaper-- you talked
about this in "Stealing Fire."

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.720 align:middle line:90%
The wallpaper matters less.

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Your cultural
constructions usually

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:25.660 align:middle line:84%
will govern what you find
inside the psychedelic trip.

00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'm less interested
in the actual veracity

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.510 align:middle line:90%
of your experience.

00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's actually--

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:28.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm only interested--

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.823 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:57:29.823 --> 00:57:31.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --If it was
meaningful to you.

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And if it is, then we have
a moral responsibility,

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I think, to create
psychedelic spas

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.532 align:middle line:84%
and use these modalities
to heal people,

00:57:38.532 --> 00:57:39.740 align:middle line:90%
but I'll turn it over to you.

00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:42.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I was just going to get--
the one thing that I think is

00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:44.710 align:middle line:84%
really fascinating-- most
people don't know this,

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is we only see four patterns
when we hallucinate.

00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And they're maps.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.400 align:middle line:90%
We see spirals.

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.200 align:middle line:90%
We see lattices.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And they're all mapped onto--

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:56.957 align:middle line:90%
so why do things spiral on acid?

00:57:56.957 --> 00:57:58.540 align:middle line:84%
When information
comes into the brain,

00:57:58.540 --> 00:57:59.832 align:middle line:90%
visual information goes to V1s.

00:57:59.832 --> 00:58:01.780 align:middle line:84%
The first level of
visual processing

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.220 align:middle line:90%
does edge recognition.

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:05.930 align:middle line:90%
It says this is a straight line.

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:08.650 align:middle line:84%
This is right where this object
ends, and this object begins.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't do that,
things swirl together.

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.180 align:middle line:84%
That's what the
swirling is on acid.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the breaking down of
edge recognition, if you want.

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.110 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's fascinating.

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:21.675 align:middle line:84%
But I want to expand
on what you said.

00:58:21.675 --> 00:58:23.050 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason
he poked at awe.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at psychedelics.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is
that roughly there's

00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:30.190 align:middle line:84%
differences, but
roughly the same.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:34.070 align:middle line:84%
William James pointed this
out way back in, I guess,

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.510 align:middle line:84%
1902, when he
published "Varieties

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:37.310 align:middle line:90%
of Religious Experiences."

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.140 align:middle line:84%
He said two things
about all these.

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:84%
He went around the world
looking at every kind

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:43.020 align:middle line:84%
of mystical experience
he can find,

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.080 align:middle line:84%
including a lot of
psychedelic experiences.

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't matter kind
of what he looked at.

00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:51.232 align:middle line:84%
They all-- A, he said,
look, these things--

00:58:51.232 --> 00:58:52.940 align:middle line:84%
you can believe what
you want about them,

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.560 align:middle line:84%
but they are
psychologically real.

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:56.480 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of
these experiences,

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.530 align:middle line:90%
people feel better.

00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:59.480 align:middle line:84%
They have better and
more meaningful lives,

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.230 align:middle line:84%
and they heal trauma
and blah, blah, blah.

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Psychologically real.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.750 align:middle line:90%
That's-- excellent term.

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:04.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:05.020 align:middle line:90%


00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.320 align:middle line:90%
No, because look, look, look.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.867 align:middle line:90%
We all want real real.

00:59:09.867 --> 00:59:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you have
a psychedelic trip

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:12.867 align:middle line:84%
and you have an
experience of what

00:59:12.867 --> 00:59:16.280 align:middle line:84%
you think God is, you
want it to be real real.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It's psychologically real.

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:19.580 align:middle line:90%
But you want it to be real real.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.163 align:middle line:84%
Because that would be something
that you can put in a suitcase

00:59:22.163 --> 00:59:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and be like, oh, I
have the actual answer.

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, it
doesn't feel like we can ever

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.460 align:middle line:90%
know the real real.

00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But the psychologically real
can still be deeply meaningful.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:36.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm troubled by the
spiritual narcissism

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:38.012 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual
fundamentalism of people

00:59:38.012 --> 00:59:40.345 align:middle line:84%
who have psychedelic experiences
and think that they are

00:59:40.345 --> 00:59:42.050 align:middle line:84%
the Messiah, that
the download they

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:46.370 align:middle line:84%
got combined with their
cultural interpretation--

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:48.290 align:middle line:84%
they somehow think is
unbiased, and that they

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:49.890 align:middle line:90%
know unvarnished truth.

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:50.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, no.

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:52.985 align:middle line:84%
You had a deeply psychologically
meaningful experience,

00:59:52.985 --> 00:59:54.560 align:middle line:84%
a psychologically
real experience.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get to tell me
what's true for me at all.

00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem, I think,
when people get up on stages

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and start playing Messiah.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelic guruism
makes me allergic,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.270 align:middle line:90%
and I think it does you, too.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, rule one
for me is nobody

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.468 align:middle line:90%
gets to make meaning for you.

01:00:14.468 --> 01:00:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The minute somebody else
starts making meaning for you,

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.470 align:middle line:90%
you just run.

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.670 align:middle line:90%
That's rule one.

01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to elaborate
on-- and the second thing

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.410 align:middle line:84%
William James said
is he said, look,

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I think all these
states are the same.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I think flow states,
and trance states,

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.892 align:middle line:84%
and out-of-body experiences,
and psychedelic--

01:00:31.892 --> 01:00:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I think they're all the same.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.473 align:middle line:84%
What's amazing-- all
right, this is a guy who--

01:00:35.473 --> 01:00:37.640 align:middle line:84%
this was the guy who came
up with the idea of stream

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.490 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
measure how long.

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:44.330 align:middle line:84%
He figured out that the now
is 12 seconds long by timing

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:45.890 align:middle line:90%
his thoughts with a stopwatch.

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
This is experiments
in like 1900, right?

01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Here's the funny thing.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.490 align:middle line:84%
The now is actually
14 seconds long.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.290 align:middle line:90%
So he was off.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
He was really close,
besides the point.

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But what we now know 110 years
later is he was totally right.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So if you look under the hood of
flow, psychedelic experiences,

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
trance states, out-of-body
experiences, meditative states,

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
we roughly see the same three
or four things happening.

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
There are differences.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:15.065 align:middle line:84%
You get way more serotonin and
a lot of psychedelic experiences

01:01:15.065 --> 01:01:15.940 align:middle line:90%
and blah, blah, blah.

01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So there's differences,
but they're

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.550 align:middle line:90%
roughly the same experience.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is-- for
example, let's take trauma.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have all
kinds of options.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
So you referenced my friend,
Rick Doblin's early experiments

01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:28.750 align:middle line:90%
with Michael Mithoefer--

01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
PTSD and MDMA--
where they found one

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.700 align:middle line:84%
to three sessions
of MDMA therapy

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
was enough to either totally
take people off their meds

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
or completely reduce
their use, right?

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:39.890 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was done with
soldiers returning

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
from wars in Afghanistan, and
Iraq, and with victims of child

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:48.050 align:middle line:90%
abuse and sexual abuse.

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the Army came
along and said, OK, well, we

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
need that kind of
healing for our soldiers,

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.690 align:middle line:84%
but we don't want to
use a psychedelic.

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to substitute flow
and more specifically, the flow

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
produced by surfing
and talk therapy.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.970 align:middle line:84%
So the same thing in
psychedelic therapy

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.100 align:middle line:84%
where you had psychedelic
and talk therapy.

01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
They just used
surfing as a producer,

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
as a trigger for flow
and talk therapy.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And they found that five weeks
of surfing, plus talk therapy

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.250 align:middle line:84%
was enough to completely
cure or significantly reduce

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:19.630 align:middle line:90%
instances of PTSD.

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they came back a
couple years later and said,

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:25.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's try meditation
and talk therapy.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And they found that four
weeks of meditation and talk

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
therapy-- not quite as effective
as the other two technologies,

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but again, significant
reduction in medication.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And the point is that whether
it's skills or healing,

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.783 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what nature
designed us to do

01:02:41.783 --> 01:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
was to shift our state
of consciousness.

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:44.250 align:middle line:90%
That's how.

01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:46.235 align:middle line:84%
So creativity is
a great example.

01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:49.965 align:middle line:84%
We have overwhelming evidence
that we suck at training people

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:51.090 align:middle line:90%
to be more creative, right?

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the most important
skill in the 21st century.

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:54.808 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
if you're talking

01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
about qualities in a CEO
or what our kids need

01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:57.960 align:middle line:90%
to learn in school.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.255 align:middle line:90%
Creativity tops every list.

01:02:59.255 --> 01:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And we suck at training
people to be more creative.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:04.927 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is we keep trying
to trade up a set of skills.

01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
What we need to be doing is
training up a state of mind,

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
we're creative.

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:09.780 align:middle line:90%
We switch our consciousness.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
That also turns out
how we heal trauma.

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And metabolized trauma,
also in a big way,

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.740 align:middle line:90%
is switch our consciousness.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
The simple explanation
is I always tell

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
people, if you're
ever heartbroken,

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:23.380 align:middle line:84%
you want to get over it
really fast, go skydiving.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Simplest, literally.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Because with trauma, it's just
pathways in the brain, right?

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:31.920 align:middle line:84%
It's like water
carving a canyon.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Everything goes there.

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.975 align:middle line:84%
And nothing is more powerful
than the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:36.330 align:middle line:90%
So you need an experience.

01:03:36.330 --> 01:03:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Shake the snow globe.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> You need to--

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:38.280 align:middle line:90%
right.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.072 align:middle line:84%
As Robin Carhartt Harris
says at Imperial--

01:03:40.072 --> 01:03:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I friended-- you
shake the snow globe.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
You need an experience
that is more powerful--

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --than the thing that crushed
you to create a new memory,

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And so one of the things
psychedelics will do--

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So they say you need one
nail to take out the other nail.

01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:55.020 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.700 align:middle line:90%
But it's so interesting.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Because some people will
say to get over heartbreak,

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.255 align:middle line:90%
meet a new girl.

01:04:00.255 --> 01:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying
goes deeper than that.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because you're saying
neurobiologically,

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.715 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to just
be meet a new person.

01:04:05.715 --> 01:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Just go have a new
experience that

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
is so powerful that the
presence supersedes the past.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
heart-broken,

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.540 align:middle line:84%
the whole point is you're not
living in the present, right?

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.850 align:middle line:84%
She broke up with you,
or he broke up with you.

01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, every present moment
is tainted by the past, right?

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.920 align:middle line:84%
David Lenson calls it
temporal dislocation.

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And he was talking about
what happens to people

01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
with bad trips on drugs.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.305 align:middle line:84%
But I think it applies to sober
states when your heart-broken--

01:04:33.305 --> 01:04:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, I
do want to say--

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --which is also a bad trip.

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But he basically says that
the past trauma is now

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.540 align:middle line:90%
over-determining the present.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And by over-determining
the present,

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
it means that what's
happening now--

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
we're fine.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.420 align:middle line:90%
But I'm seeing dark.

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing black, because
of that past trauma.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And then by over-determining
what's happening now,

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.140 align:middle line:84%
bringing that anxiety
into what's happening now,

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm now conjuring up a future
that becomes identified

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.720 align:middle line:90%
with doom, death, despair.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
Hyperpression
[INAUDIBLE] of mortality

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is an integral part of
every bad psychedelic trip.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:07.593 align:middle line:90%
The doom, doom.

01:05:07.593 --> 01:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to make
it past the next moment.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The essence of a
panic attack is that.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm dying right
now, so to speak.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.470 align:middle line:90%
And so he says that when--

01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:20.760 align:middle line:84%
but he says
eventually the present

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.290 align:middle line:90%
will supersede the past.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So enough time passes
that you can overcome

01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:27.870 align:middle line:90%
this temporal dislocation.

01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Or you can have a sufficiently
powerful experience

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.170 align:middle line:90%
that's positive that replaces--

01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:38.970 align:middle line:84%
it just dissipates that
wedge, that trauma.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
That's David Lenson's idea.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What were going to say?

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Yep, it's gone.

01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Totally gone.

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.550 align:middle line:90%
Got lost in the Jason.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We have, I think,
a few minutes left.

01:05:51.330 --> 01:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we'll take some
questions from the audience.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I already see a hand over there
if you can speak up, unless--

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.026 align:middle line:90%
And we'll just share this one.

01:06:00.026 --> 01:06:00.826 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:04.650 align:middle line:90%


01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.050 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking so
much this weekend.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.180 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a very strong woman--

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.210 align:middle line:90%
alpha, right?

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.850 align:middle line:90%
Have put a lot on my plate.

01:06:14.850 --> 01:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I literally have so many
projects going on at one time.

01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very structured,
Virgo brained, logical side.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And my question is,
how can I kind of help

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
myself create a little
bit of structure

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to integrate flow into my life?

01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And what would you suggest
that would look like,

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:38.970 align:middle line:84%
whether it's ingesting
cannabis, or maybe taking

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
an hour out of my day,
or something like that.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I literally live so structured
that it's hard for me

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.280 align:middle line:90%
to break out of that.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So if any suggestions on
how to integrate flow,

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
what that can look
like from flow masters.

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I would say that
novelty in an uninterrupted

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.860 align:middle line:84%
setting with a little bit
of cannabis and somebody you

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:03.060 align:middle line:90%
really, really like.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:07.400 align:middle line:90%


01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
like improv theater.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You know how they say that
improv is so good for getting

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
rid of anxiety?

01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're on stage
doing like an improv troupe,

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.980 align:middle line:84%
it's like, OK,
here's the setting.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.480 align:middle line:90%
Here's the situation.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Go.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And once they say go, well,
now you're in the present.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Now, you are in it.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I always say when
you're creating an experience,

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.160 align:middle line:84%
it's like you're
picking the location.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It means you're
setting the stage.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
You're window-dressing
the stage.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Because once you hit go
and you're in the present,

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
that stage is going
to be where you're

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.180 align:middle line:90%
going to be interacting with.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
So pick a place.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.143 align:middle line:90%
And then pick the people.

01:07:39.143 --> 01:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the ingredients
in the salad.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Because once you get
stoned, those people

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:45.930 align:middle line:84%
are going to now infuse
into your experience.

01:07:45.930 --> 01:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Somebody once said that cannabis
intoxication is a fusion

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
of cognition and dream.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So I often think of
the film "Inception,"

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.790 align:middle line:90%
like when they're dreaming.

01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.220 align:middle line:84%
If they're dreaming
in the real world.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.278 align:middle line:84%
And then in layer one,
they're like whatever,

01:07:58.278 --> 01:07:59.820 align:middle line:84%
having something
happen in the dream.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.590 align:middle line:84%
In the real world, you
pour water on them.

01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream world,
it starts to rain.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
happens when you're high.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.208 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you've preplanned
and the people that you're

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
with-- once you enter
that altered states,

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
all those things are going to
infuse into the waking dream

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:17.939 align:middle line:84%
that you're having into,
quote unquote, "your trip."

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And so that's very
important that you

01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:23.040 align:middle line:84%
plan the context in which
you're going to submit.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Because at some point,
you have to submit, right?

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:28.077 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
Robert Moore who said,

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:29.660 align:middle line:84%
"If you cannot submit,
you cannot die.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.620 align:middle line:84%
If you cannot die,
you cannot be reborn."

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But he's talking about a
psychological surrendering

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.140 align:middle line:84%
into the moment, the bliss
crucifixion, as our friend,

01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Jamie Wheal likes to say.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.399 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.870 align:middle line:90%
I think it's about curation.

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Give me that.

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.574 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:44.574 --> 01:08:44.889 align:middle line:90%


01:08:44.889 --> 01:08:45.689 align:middle line:90%
You're done.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:46.489 align:middle line:90%
You're fired.

01:08:46.489 --> 01:08:47.703 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:47.703 --> 01:08:51.479 align:middle line:90%


01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Jason is not wrong.

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Personally, you can use
a lot of technologies.

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.229 align:middle line:84%
You can use a lot
of pharmacologies.

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.479 align:middle line:84%
I don't like to depend
on either, which is not

01:09:01.479 --> 01:09:03.250 align:middle line:90%
to say that I don't like them.

01:09:03.250 --> 01:09:06.096 align:middle line:84%
It's that I want to be
able to be at my best

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:07.304 align:middle line:90%
when I need to be at my best.

01:09:07.304 --> 01:09:08.529 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to have to--

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:12.970 align:middle line:84%
so I like the psychological
triggers-- novelty, complexity,

01:09:12.970 --> 01:09:13.899 align:middle line:90%
unpredictability.

01:09:13.899 --> 01:09:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Jason is not wrong.

01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:16.750 align:middle line:90%
They spike dopamine 400%.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:19.990 align:middle line:84%
This is Robert Sapolsky's
work at Stanford.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And so those are great,
great flow triggers.

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Risk is a great flow trigger.

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
From your description
of yourself,

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.223 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like you
could use some.

01:09:30.223 --> 01:09:32.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I take risk.

01:09:32.543 --> 01:09:36.180 align:middle line:90%
But I also jam pack my schedule.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:40.455 align:middle line:84%
I'm an entrepreneur, so
everything I do is work.

01:09:40.455 --> 01:09:45.700 align:middle line:90%
>> So figure out what it is.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Figure out the main
activity that gives you

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:50.433 align:middle line:84%
the most flow that's
outside of work

01:09:50.433 --> 01:09:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and just do it as
much as you can.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I run three companies,
and I write a book a year.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And twice a week
I find a full day

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.290 align:middle line:84%
to hurl myself down mountains at
high speeds on mountain bikes,

01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:03.690 align:middle line:90%
or on skis, or whatever.

01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:07.475 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is in flow work,
we always talk about this.

01:10:07.475 --> 01:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go
slow to go fast.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:13.300 align:middle line:84%
So you think if you take two
days off to go do whatever

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.060 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're going to
do, that'll produce more flow,

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.620 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose time.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:20.238 align:middle line:84%
You're 500% more
productive in flow.

01:10:20.238 --> 01:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
This is not just a
number I'm throwing out.

01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
McKinsey did a study of
top executives in flow.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.495 align:middle line:84%
It was subjectively reported,
so take it or leave it.

01:10:27.495 --> 01:10:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But across the board-- and
a huge swatch of people.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.352 align:middle line:84%
They reported being
5X more productive.

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:32.185 align:middle line:90%
Put that in context.

01:10:32.185 --> 01:10:33.750 align:middle line:90%
It's 500% more productive.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
It means you got
to work on Monday.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Spend it in flow state.

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.500 align:middle line:84%
You can take Tuesday
through Friday off,

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to get as
much done as your steady state

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.340 align:middle line:90%
peers.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a massive acceleration.

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So even though it feels
like you're wasting time,

01:10:47.380 --> 01:10:49.342 align:middle line:90%
you're actually gaining time.

01:10:49.342 --> 01:10:50.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

01:10:50.818 --> 01:10:54.262 align:middle line:84%
Using flow every day-- since
you're a structured creative,

01:10:54.262 --> 01:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
you write every day, right?

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I do write every day.

01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:59.685 align:middle line:90%
And I would say--

01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and this is after
years of working at it.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.280 align:middle line:90%
So flow is a spectrum, right?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It goes from-- it's like
any emotion angle, right?

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.090 align:middle line:90%
You're a little irked.

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:12.420 align:middle line:84%
You're [INAUDIBLE]---- it's
still the same emotion, right?

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Flow works the same way.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
You can be in a
state of micro-flow

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.310 align:middle line:84%
where flow's core
characteristics show up

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:18.910 align:middle line:84%
a little bit or
macro-flow, which

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:21.138 align:middle line:84%
is the full-blown mystical
experience that I had.

01:11:21.138 --> 01:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Micro-flow-- most
people, by the way,

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.780 align:middle line:84%
spend 5% of their work
life in micro-flow

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.010 align:middle line:90%
and don't even realize it.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So I would say 90% of the
time I can drop into flow.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, sleep is absolutely
critical for me.

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:36.790 align:middle line:90%
Not for me.

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:37.590 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:39.103 align:middle line:90%
I've tried it.

01:11:39.103 --> 01:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no food that I can
correlate with flow whatsoever.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.687 align:middle line:84%
There's no nutrition that
I can correlate with flow.

01:11:43.687 --> 01:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I did a 10-year
study on myself in skiing,

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.360 align:middle line:90%
trying to correlate it to food.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And I found that the thing
that produced the most flow

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:52.003 align:middle line:84%
is when I didn't have
time to eat breakfast,

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and stopped at the gas station,
and bought cheap donuts.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:55.757 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that produced
the most flow.

01:11:55.757 --> 01:11:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's literally--
as far as I can tell,

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
that's just a fast
metabolism and energy there.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
So I don't see any
correlation there.

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:05.876 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, does that help?

01:12:05.876 --> 01:12:06.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:12:06.676 --> 01:12:07.476 align:middle line:90%
I'll ask him.

01:12:07.476 --> 01:12:09.116 align:middle line:90%
Do you do flow every day?

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I do flow every day?

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Flow every day?

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, no, no.

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But if I get good sleep, I am
comfortable with my baseline

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
for the first few hours
of the day in the sense

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
that if I get good
sleep, I'm just

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
kind of happy with the
calmness with which I wake.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like some
coffee, some emails,

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%
get this shit done, so to speak.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And then usually by noon or
1 o'clock, I'm ready to flip.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:45.543 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I go from morning
and convergent thinking.

01:12:45.543 --> 01:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And then in the afternoon, I
want like divergent thinking.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.490 align:middle line:84%
I want to go for
a hike, and I want

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to have unexpected insights,
and et cetera, et cetera.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.590 align:middle line:90%
But I tend to be--

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I tend to purposefully
treat myself

01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:00.620 align:middle line:90%
in a very calm matter on a day--

01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.100 align:middle line:84%
calm manner-- sorry--
on a day-to-day basis.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.010 align:middle line:90%
Because it's kind of like--

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
in a way it's like this
monk-like quietness,

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
so that when the
opportunity for flow comes,

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.110 align:middle line:90%
I can just fully roar into it.

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there's nothing I hate
more than giving my energy away

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:25.470 align:middle line:84%
for something not deeply
meaningful like that.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.600 align:middle line:84%
I then get real
self-critical like,

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.130 align:middle line:90%
why did I allow that to happen?

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Like to let somebody
cannibalize my time

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
in meaningless engagement.

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have to
avoid people, too,

01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
because I find certain
people draining.

01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.330 align:middle line:90%
No offense to them.

01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:47.070 align:middle line:90%
It's just me.

01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I want to
save my engagement

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.300 align:middle line:90%
for the deeply meaningful.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:59.442 align:middle line:84%
And I will build my whole life
according to that value system.

01:13:59.442 --> 01:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> One more question.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> One more question,
and then we're done.

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
almost out of time.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So pick.

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
You pick.

01:14:06.650 --> 01:14:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Point at somebody.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:08.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:14:08.546 --> 01:14:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So wait, wait, wait.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So projecting, let's say,
15 years ahead, instead of 10,

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:22.060 align:middle line:84%
do you think that flow
will enhance our lives,

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.160 align:middle line:90%
our longevity?

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think it will
diminish our longevity

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.054 align:middle line:90%
in a scientific point of view?

01:14:28.054 --> 01:14:30.960 align:middle line:90%


01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Why longevity?

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, longevity,
living longer, right?

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:38.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, here's--

01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I got into-- when
I wrote up on this,

01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
we said earlier that
technology gives us

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
the potential to solve the
world's greatest challenges.

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And I said it's going
to require the largest

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.450 align:middle line:90%
cooperative effort in history.

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
that, I don't just

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
mean it's going to require
everybody working together

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:56.760 align:middle line:90%
to solve these problems.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody at their
absolute best working together.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.460 align:middle line:90%
And that means flow, right?

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're
all going to have

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.192 align:middle line:90%
to get very, very good at this.

01:15:04.192 --> 01:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, it's
already happening.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.560 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the last company--

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I was with the Flow
Genome Project--

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
has been training
up corporations

01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:16.510 align:middle line:90%
all across the boards.

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
A lot of other
organizations are doing it.

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.510 align:middle line:84%
This stuff is working
its way into business.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's already deep into the arts.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.200 align:middle line:90%
This is human performance.

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And an accelerated-- one of
the most interesting things

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.858 align:middle line:84%
about flow is that
if you're going

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
to keep pace in an
exponential world,

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.550 align:middle line:90%
you need to do two things.

01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to move at
speed, and you need

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:35.600 align:middle line:90%
to be able to think at scale.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And as Jason pointed
out, the human brain

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.170 align:middle line:90%
doesn't think at scale, right?

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:42.670 align:middle line:84%
We literally cannot
process exponential change.

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
In flow, we can.

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything speeds up.

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Literally, the brain's
pattern recognition-- we take

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:48.922 align:middle line:90%
in more information per second.

01:15:48.922 --> 01:15:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We process this more quickly.

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So we can-- that's how our
brains can think in this world.

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's going
to be fundamental.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:57.508 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to see
50 years from now,

01:15:57.508 --> 01:15:58.550 align:middle line:90%
we're going to need this.

01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
interesting about flow

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.350 align:middle line:90%
is-- and it's not guaranteed.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
But it does tend to produce
more empathy over time,

01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
especially expanding it
into the natural world.

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So it expand-- the flow tends
to not only increase empathy.

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It tends to expand
the line of empathy

01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
often beyond the border of
species, which is the biggest--

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
one of the reasons we're in a
giant environmental crisis is

01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:25.280 align:middle line:90%
it's not empathy for all.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It's empathy for
humans, perhaps,

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:29.030 align:middle line:90%
but we don't see plants.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't see animals.

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:31.620 align:middle line:90%
We don't see ecosystems.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So we don't realize
that we're in the middle

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:35.150 align:middle line:90%
of the sixth great extinction.

01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Just to follow up then,
what do you think the chemical

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
impact on our actual biological
systems is being triggered

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:46.933 align:middle line:90%
by flow?

01:16:46.933 --> 01:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Is flow taxing on the body?

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.335 align:middle line:90%
>> In a chemical way.

01:16:50.335 --> 01:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, will it
shorten your life?

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:53.958 align:middle line:84%
No, it will actually--
so that's interesting.

01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
That's an interesting question.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:56.050 align:middle line:90%
We don't know.

01:16:56.050 --> 01:16:58.450 align:middle line:84%
What we do know-- and this is
extremely well established.

01:16:58.450 --> 01:17:00.620 align:middle line:84%
This is sort of in
positive psychology.

01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.280 align:middle line:84%
There are three
levels of happiness.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.540 align:middle line:84%
There's happiness--
how you feel right now.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:06.430 align:middle line:84%
And there's not a whole
lot you can do there.

01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
There's a little bit of
techniques you can have.

01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:09.903 align:middle line:90%
But pretty much it's--

01:17:09.903 --> 01:17:10.820 align:middle line:90%
a lot of it's genetic.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:11.660 align:middle line:90%
A lot of it's nature, nurture.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:12.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't do much.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Second level is what they call
enjoyment, which is literally

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.970 align:middle line:90%
a high flow life, right?

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And the third level
is a meaningful life.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's high flow,
plus purpose, basically.

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:25.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we know is the
people who score off

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.620 align:middle line:84%
the charts for overall
life satisfaction,

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.942 align:middle line:84%
by the way which
correlates with longevity,

01:17:29.942 --> 01:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
are the people who have the
most flow in their lives.

01:17:32.150 --> 01:17:35.045 align:middle line:84%
So indirectly, there
should be a correlation

01:17:35.045 --> 01:17:36.170 align:middle line:90%
between flow and longevity.

01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But, one, no, I have no
idea how we would study it.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And nobody I know has even
poked at it, but it's--

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're thinking
along the right lines,

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.620 align:middle line:84%
but we're just not there yet
from a research perspective.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And I try not to
speculate on stage.

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:52.073 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:17:52.073 --> 01:17:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> What if it's her birthday?

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Say again.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's her birthday.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, go for it.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a question.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:03.830 align:middle line:84%
So I am so incredibly
awe inspired,

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:05.430 align:middle line:90%
like that awe inspiring.

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:07.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You do that for me.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:15.050 align:middle line:84%
I would love to know, because
I am motivated by triggers.

01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:16.438 align:middle line:84%
And that's my
progressive growth,

01:18:16.438 --> 01:18:17.480 align:middle line:90%
and I'll never stop that.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:20.090 align:middle line:84%
But can I just know
in the way that I

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:23.300 align:middle line:84%
relate to you, what is your
most awe-inspired heaven?

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I just want to be
inspired by that for you

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:26.840 align:middle line:90%
for a moment on my birthday.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.670 align:middle line:90%
>> My most awe-inspired heaven?

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
You mean like the
scenario in which I--

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever is perfect for you.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.565 align:middle line:84%
What do you want
in life the most?

01:18:35.565 --> 01:18:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, what do I want
in life the most?

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your most
awe-inspiring moment?

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:42.090 align:middle line:90%


01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:43.980 align:middle line:84%
I want-- this is my
birthday cake right now.

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:45.730 align:middle line:90%


01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:47.730 align:middle line:84%
You're my intellectual
dessert right now.

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:49.227 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

01:18:49.227 --> 01:18:58.210 align:middle line:90%


01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> You guys are awesome.

01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:02.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience that I like
the most psychologically is

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:13.880 align:middle line:90%
probably catharsis.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading this
line by Alain de Botton.

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:18.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, "You don't cry
because something is sad.

01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:20.470 align:middle line:84%
You cry because something
is more beautiful

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:22.566 align:middle line:90%
than you expected it to be."

01:19:22.566 --> 01:19:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when I am plotting
my next container for a flow

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:32.470 align:middle line:84%
experience, whether it's a trip
with friends to South Africa

01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
to go on safari and to
make sure that we have

01:19:34.690 --> 01:19:36.730 align:middle line:84%
ganga right before
we go on safari

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.480 align:middle line:84%
and that it's sunset
so that it's perfect,

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and we play the
inception score, and then

01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:43.495 align:middle line:84%
we encounter the lions, and
we have a moment of grace,

01:19:43.495 --> 01:19:44.295 align:middle line:90%
I like to create--

01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:45.640 align:middle line:90%
>> He's kidding, by the way.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.110 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.310 align:middle line:90%


01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:49.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It sounds amazing to me.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to create
my own movie.

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
I really-- I think of
myself as when I'm in flow,

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I want to do the following.

01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to simultaneously
be the director,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
like the DP of the film, the
actor, and the editor, right?

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
So I want to perform
in my own movie.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:11.693 align:middle line:84%
I want to steer where
the camera goes.

01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But then I also want to make
like editing choices of like,

01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
cue this song,
cut to this scene.

01:20:17.650 --> 01:20:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I want to do all those
things at once, right?

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's a kind of waking--

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, because-- yeah.

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's making
a joke about it.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:29.440 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:35.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about trying to artfully
induce beautiful moments very

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.400 align:middle line:84%
consciously and very creatively
and making sure that my mind--

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'm normally such
a skeptic, making sure

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that my mind is primed
for high suggestibility,

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:49.040 align:middle line:84%
so that I'm open to the
experience I'm giving myself,

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.590 align:middle line:84%
rather than closed to
it, which is how I often

01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%
am when I'm in my default mode.

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's like as long as I can
create some of those moments

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, and get the
grace that comes from it,

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and then the tears from
catharsis from realizing, wow,

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a holy moment, that
fills my chalice for a couple

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.890 align:middle line:90%
days.

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:10.310 align:middle line:90%
So that's-- yeah, that's it.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I can
hopefully make a video

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and share it with people, which
is like the icing on the cake,

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:14.480 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Because he's saying
that sounds like

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.990 align:middle line:90%
such self-indulgent behavior.

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:19.582 align:middle line:84%
But it's like Joseph
Campbell said,

01:21:19.582 --> 01:21:21.290 align:middle line:84%
"You're not in a quest
to save the world,

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:22.250 align:middle line:90%
but to save yourself."

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so,
you save the world.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Because when I do
those things, I

01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:28.855 align:middle line:84%
output so much more content that
ends up resonating with people.

01:21:28.855 --> 01:21:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
oh, I actually

01:21:30.230 --> 01:21:33.020 align:middle line:90%
am being of service, too.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.140 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.830 align:middle line:90%


01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, guys.

01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:40.110 align:middle line:90%
We are the gods now.

01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:50.934 align:middle line:90%
