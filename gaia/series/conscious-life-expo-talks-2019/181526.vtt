00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:06.017 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, really, there
should be no other form

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.770 align:middle line:90%
of life, right?

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.770 align:middle line:84%
There just should just
be conscious life, right?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.530 align:middle line:84%
That we are actually
pure consciousness.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when we come
here living the life

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that we come here
to live, it should

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.940 align:middle line:90%
be one of full wakefulness.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a great
joy and a great honor

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to share
the content with you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that we will get to
connect on today.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So are you enjoying
the conference so far?

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous, fabulous.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So it is a conversation that
I've been in my whole life.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a natural
health care environment.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
My father was a pioneer
in energy medicine,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
long before it was even
called energy medicine.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And he worked with
natural healing techniques

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and found the common
theme underneath everyone

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:84%
who healed as they
healed-- why they healed

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.130 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
how the energy was

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
flowing through their system,
how energy was moving.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he started to recognize
that the thing that interrupted

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
the energy flow more
than anything else

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:90%
was emotional unresolvedness.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Basically, if someone
experienced something

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.357 align:middle line:84%
that they were then unable
to metabolize emotionally--

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
they didn't understand it,
they couldn't wrap their mind

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
around it, they couldn't
embrace it in some way,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:84%
they kind of shoved
it back in the pocket

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and then it got left
there for later, right?

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is that you
just keep shoving things

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
in the pocket for later,
and pretty soon the pockets

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:90%
get full.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he found basically was
that that unresolved residue

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
of energetic emotional
energy was ultimately

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
the cause for the blockage
of flow through the system.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised in
that environment.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.720 align:middle line:84%
I've never gone to the doctor
and taken an antibiotic

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%
for a health concern.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I've never had a
prescription drug of any kind

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 86 years old.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:90%
So what we know--

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm not 86 years old, no.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm only 83.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But I look pretty
good for 86, don't I?

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.277 align:middle line:84%
So I never understood why
people lie about their age going

00:02:19.277 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:90%
the other direction.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you say you're
86 and people are like, wow,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:90%
oh you look great!

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not 86, but I am younger
today than I was 20 years ago.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm more flexible,
I'm more pliable,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
I do 10 times more
than I did 20,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
30 years ago when
I opened my clinic

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and started treating patients.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I would see about
60 patients a day,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.517 align:middle line:84%
and I'd have to take a
nap at lunchtime just

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
to get through the
afternoon patients,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and I'm 24, 26, 30 years old.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened
in my life is something

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:84%
that I know everyone
is ultimately

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:90%
interested in having happen.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:84%
What happened in my life is what
every out-of-body experiencer

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:90%
wants to experience.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Every near-death experience
is an access to the same thing

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
speak to you about.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And this happened in my life,
and it happened in my life

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
in a different fashion, but
it happened nonetheless.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.865 align:middle line:84%
So I'm friends with
Anita Moorjani,

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
you know who she is with
her "Dying to Be Me"

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and her experiences
in that realm,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and bringing the
capacity to heal oneself

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.180 align:middle line:84%
back here into this
dimension and being

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.970 align:middle line:84%
able to share that
information with others.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm friends with
Eben Alexander--

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.790 align:middle line:84%
you know who that is with "Proof
of Heaven" and "Map of Heaven,"

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the works that he has
been working with.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting ready to release
a book with Simon & Schuster

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
in a couple of weeks,
actually, and in that, I

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.300 align:middle line:84%
am referring to you
the kinds of things

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that we need to do in order to
have those kinds of experiences

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:84%
without leaving the
body, without having

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
a near-death
experience, et cetera.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar with
Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor who

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:90%
wrote "My Stroke of Insight?"

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So she wrote the
foreword to the book,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and the reason for that I'm
sharing all of this information

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:84%
with you is that each
of these individuals

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
are bringing forth very
important information,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.070 align:middle line:90%
as well as many others.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But in particular, they're
on my mind this morning

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
because of the common
ground that they stand on.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And what it has to
do with us is is us

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.610 align:middle line:84%
awakening to the greater
version of who we are.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
I came in last night
to watch Marianne

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.550 align:middle line:84%
give her presentation--
were you guys here for that?

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, fabulous.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
in the audience

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and I looked back here
and saw this image back

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:90%
on the background--

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.940 align:middle line:90%
on the background wall.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that that
image is this image here

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to share some
information with you about.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And this information
was channeled

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.780 align:middle line:84%
in to our world in the
1920s, and that information

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
was about accessing
the higher self.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.120 align:middle line:84%
So someone painted an original
drawing, an original painting

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
of that information because
they were accessing it

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:84%
in their own meditation, in
their consciousness, et cetera.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
actually referencing is

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is that this is a
depiction of what

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
we've learned as
Christed consciousness

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or Buddhic
consciousness, et cetera.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, every
single one of us

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is destined to
recognize that this

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.530 align:middle line:90%
is the truth of who we are.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
we can go to and perceive

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:90%
and see and experience.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
It's actually supposed to be
come from, and a few thousand

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
years ago on every
aspect of our planet,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:84%
this information
was being revealed.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing us
that we have the capacity

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:84%
to elevate our awareness,
to elevate our consciousness

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
to such a high
vibrational frequency,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that we can perceive beyond
a world of either/or,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
beyond a world of survivorship,
beyond a world of disease

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.660 align:middle line:84%
and conflict and disagreement
and discordant energies.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
That it's only a
level of consciousness

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that ultimately determines
the life experience

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:90%
that we are having.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we are not elevated to
a higher or higher or higher

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
level of consciousness,
we spend our lives

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%
trying to outrun disease,
trying to fix problems,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to identify what is
broken, what is missing,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:90%
or what is wrong.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is, none of that

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
is what we're supposed
to be interested in.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.990 align:middle line:84%
None of that is what we're
supposed to be pursuing.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:90%
We have a culture--

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
we have developed a culture that
is so interested in diagnosing

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:84%
problems and then fixing
them, that all we get good at

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
is diagnosing problems and
getting gooder, gooder,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
and gooder at fixing them,
getting better and better

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
at finding the
solution to a problem.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:90%
What did I do?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.407 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with this?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And that being our
come-from is part

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.770 align:middle line:84%
of why we never land in a
higher or higher or higher

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Think about it as
consciousness is here

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
where we are finding
these dualistic issues

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:84%
and merging and melding
plans and programs into place

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.880 align:middle line:84%
to fix them, to
correct for them,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
to add to them the
byproduct that is required.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And instead, what
we need to be doing

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.668 align:middle line:84%
is asking completely
different questions,

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
spending our energy in
completely different

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
directions, focusing our
attention from a different part

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.790 align:middle line:90%
of who we are.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
share with you today

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:84%
how we can do that in
a very user-friendly,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.610 align:middle line:84%
highly-functional way that will
create a shift in our own life

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:84%
experience, and even more
importantly or as importantly,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I should say, also
create a shift

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness
of our families

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and our communities
and consciousness

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.920 align:middle line:90%
at large for humanity.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
ultimately destined

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to be operating at a
much different level

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
than our parents

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and their parents and their
parents set into place.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So let me just start with saying
that I appreciate being invited

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
here to speak, and it's a joy to
share this information anywhere

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:90%
that I go.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
I have this
conversation every day,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's always more fun
when somebody is in the room

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.179 align:middle line:90%
to have it with, right?

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:84%
So I'm glad you're
here, all right?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:38.809 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to get that
everything is energy.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just
energy and energy

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
is vibrating in
different frequencies.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And those different
frequencies are

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:90%
things that we have access to.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we are
supposed to have access

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to every vibrational frequency
and use it to our advantage,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and we have not been trained
to do that-- we do not

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:90%
know how to do that.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we are stumbling
around in the dark trying

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how
to get through life

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and how to access some greater
version of living life.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.340 align:middle line:84%
We then turn to
meditation or we turn

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.160 align:middle line:84%
to these out-of-body
experiences or we

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
try to access something through
prayer or through affirmations

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%
or confirmations in some way.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
to do is realize

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:84%
that there is an entirely
different perspective that

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.153 align:middle line:90%
is available to us.

00:09:28.153 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's just look
at it this way.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like when
we come here, we land--

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a rough landing.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like we slide
in and we kind of splat.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that splat,
our mind goes one way,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.347 align:middle line:84%
our body goes another
way, and our breath

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.430 align:middle line:84%
goes a different way, and
the whole spirit is just

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.190 align:middle line:84%
kind of hanging out, waiting to
see if it's ever actually going

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:90%
to be safe to come on in.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just kind of
hanging out waiting.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have
to recognize is

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
that we spend our lives trying
to pull ourselves back together

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:90%
again from this splat.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, then
mind and body and breath

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.112 align:middle line:90%
begin to function together.

00:10:05.112 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And when they
function together, we

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
pick up so much more
momentum than we have ever

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
been able to experience
in any other fashion.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And so our process
today is going

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.540 align:middle line:84%
to be about exactly
how that happens,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
how we can have that
happen for ourselves easily

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and consistently
and so much more.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
What happened with
me was in my splat,

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I became very
intimidated about life.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I was completely
afraid in the world.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I slept on the floor
of my closet as a kid

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
because I only had to look one
direction and just to be safe.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:84%
And so completely
intimidated, et cetera.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So in view of that, I
became perfectionistic,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.180 align:middle line:84%
trying really hard to
do the right thing,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.347 align:middle line:84%
to be a good person, to
show up, be a good daughter,

00:10:56.347 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
be a good sister, be a good
student, be a good everything.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that worked right
up until it didn't, OK?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And when it doesn't, it
doesn't because we will never

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.882 align:middle line:84%
be fulfilled when we
are approaching life

00:11:11.882 --> 00:11:13.090 align:middle line:90%
from a perspective like that.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Fulfillment-- success, yes;
fulfillment, not so much.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
Success, good at something,
yeah; fulfillment

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:90%
in life, not happening.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So what happened for me was then
I became drawn to meditation.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And instantly when
I began meditating,

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I had transcendent experiences.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
The very first time I closed
my eyes and were in a room

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
about this size
filled with people--

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:84%
about half this size, actually,
I dropped into a state

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and saw what is referenced
as the blue pearl.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Are you familiar
with the blue pearl?

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle line:90%
So I later recognized--

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know that
that was a thing to--

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.280 align:middle line:90%
a destination.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.322 align:middle line:84%
Thank goodness I didn't
know it was a destination

00:11:56.322 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to try to achieve because
I would have spent

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.075 align:middle line:84%
my life trying, and
when you're trying,

00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
happen, because

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
frequency of trying

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
is not the vibrational
frequency of access,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.560 align:middle line:84%
it's not the vibrational
frequency of having.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
You tracking with me?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:90%
You got this?

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So in this, I came
out of that meditation

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and described it to the
person who was assisting

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
the leader of the meditation.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And his eyes were kind of big
and reported it to the teacher.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I
knew, I got invited

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.760 align:middle line:90%
to come to India to study.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And in the period
between that invitation

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and the time I went to India,
I went to a few more meditation

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:90%
retreats.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And the very next one I
had another transcendent

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
experience, and
the very next one,

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I had an experience of
this, which is what this is.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Which is accessing the higher
self, the atman, the monad.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the Godhead, it is the
Christ and consciousness.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.780 align:middle line:90%
And so as this--

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
and the Buddhic consciousness.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And as I was in that state, it
was a tremendous, tremendously

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:90%
life-changing experience.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share
just a little bit of that

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.783 align:middle line:84%
with you, but I just
want to give you this--

00:13:10.783 --> 00:13:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I want to back up here with
a little background saying

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.943 align:middle line:84%
that as the perfectionist, I
was always trying to be good,

00:13:17.943 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
do the right thing, help
others, and all that stuff.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Anybody relate to that?

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Be a good person, do
the-- or is it just me?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me see a
show of hands here.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I know I'm
amongst friends.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I recognized was
that I was always trying,

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
and so did the teacher that
was leading these meditation

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:90%
retreats.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And so she gave me
a list of things

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.653 align:middle line:84%
to do that was literally
impossible to do

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in the amount of time that
she gave me to do it, OK?

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Perfect setup.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So after about two nights of
staying up almost all night

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:84%
with an hour of sleep trying
to get these things done

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.410 align:middle line:84%
on this list at this meditation
retreat that I was attending,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:84%
I finally on the third day
recognized I can't do this.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.333 align:middle line:84%
I own a clinic, I'm
running up and down

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the halls of the clinic all
the time treating the patients

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and managing a staff and other
doctors constantly all week

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
long, and here I am
on the weekend going

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
to these meditation
retreats and I'm just

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:90%
doing the same thing again.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So she was onto me, and now I
was kind of getting onto me.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
And I recognize, OK, hmm.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment, I was running
around behind the scenes,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:90%
I said--

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.800 align:middle line:84%
well, I can't tell you what
I said because it was--

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.255 align:middle line:90%
but it was very specific.

00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And it very much
anchored my consciousness

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:90%
in a different direction.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.980 align:middle line:84%
It was a couple of words,
and it ended in "it,"

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.615 align:middle line:84%
and I just was not doing
this anymore, basically.

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
You follow what I'm saying?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I just was done being the
do-gooder, the be-all,

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
end-all for everything
that I ever encountered.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And so in the midst of that,
I went into the ballroom

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where everybody was sitting and
having this lovely experience

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of meditation and
chanting and the candles

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
were there and the music--

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:90%
you know, it was all of that.

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I sat down and tried to
share this chant with everyone

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:90%
that was chanting.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was Sanskrit terms, which
I was not aware of at the time,

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
wasn't familiar, had
never taken a for myself

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:90%
in a moment like that ever.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
And so all my energy--

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm telling you
this for a reason

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.555 align:middle line:84%
because it's part
of your recipe,

00:15:17.555 --> 00:15:21.610 align:middle line:84%
it's part of where you have
to begin to acclimate in order

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
to have what you're
here to have,

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
what you're on this
planet to have.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
recipe that you

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to
implement, and it's

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:90%
a vibrational, energetic recipe.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.752 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the doing,
it's about the being.

00:15:34.752 --> 00:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about who are you being
while you're doing what you're

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
doing in order to get the
vibrational combination

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:84%
lock to open so that you can
arrive at your own true self.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So here I was sitting
down for the first time

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.410 align:middle line:84%
focusing on Sanskrit terms
which I did not know,

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to hold these
tones in in a chant that

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:90%
was Om Namah Shivaya.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody recognize
Om Namah Shivaya?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.625 align:middle line:84%
So in that, it was
brand new to me.

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Try to remember the first time
that you ever saw or heard

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:90%
those words, it's like what--

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:90%
what's this world?

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And I came out of
science, so my idea

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of what you do to
get an outcome,

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.380 align:middle line:84%
well it's very different
than doing nothing, right?

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like, nah.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:90%
So much so that I had--

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:90%
you get it?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.153 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:22.153 --> 00:16:24.070 align:middle line:84%
As a doctor you don't
sit there and do nothing

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.320 align:middle line:84%
when a patient comes
and-- or actually, I

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that you
could, but at the time

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.770 align:middle line:84%
it was all about the doing,
to get to fix, to heal, to do

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:90%
something to help that.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And so in this moment
I was learning how to

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
not, and I didn't
know that that's

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:90%
what I was learning how to do.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And so in that, I continued
to chant this chant

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and try to hold the tones
as long as these people were

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.950 align:middle line:84%
holding them and take the deep
breaths that were required

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to do that, which was
slowing down my breath,

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:84%
slowing down my mind, because
when you slow your breath,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
you slow your mind.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
You breathe slower,
your mind slows down.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.660 align:middle line:84%
You start running
into story and you

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.150 align:middle line:84%
want to slow that down, you
start slowing and deepening

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
your breath and it's
going to happen.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't know
that at the time.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I also didn't
know was the applications

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
of quantum science into the
whole mix, which I look forward

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:90%
to sharing with you today.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So there I am
chanting this chant,

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.119 align:middle line:84%
and concentrating on
me for the first time.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.670 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be about me, I'm
just claiming this for myself.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing, I knew I was
transported into this dimension

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I woke up here as this.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:90%
I woke up as this.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I was me, but I wasn't
in a physical body.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.530 align:middle line:84%
I was literally a
golden ray of light.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
earth beneath me

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
about the size of a marble,
and I was embedded into it

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:84%
up to about what would
have been my knees,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and I could see 360 degrees
in every direction--

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
actually, in every direction
in a spherical sense.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Without moving my
eyes, I could see here

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:57.760 align:middle line:90%
and see there and be back here.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was a light so
brilliantly bright,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
it was 10 times brighter
than the brightest day

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:90%
in the desert I had ever seen.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was a horizon,
and beneath the horizon

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.130 align:middle line:84%
there was a really
a bright light.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But the light above
it was brighter,

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
but the light below it
was very bright as well.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And this beautiful, pink,
iridescent, translucent

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.610 align:middle line:90%
horizon, a blanket--

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a pink blanket of
light was laying there.

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And every time I
took a breath in,

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:90%
it would raise up like this.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And as I would exhale, it would
just lower right back down.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And as I would inhale
again, it would just rise.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.425 align:middle line:90%
And I had free will.

00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because I noticed this and I
could start playing with it.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
I could breathe big and
it would come up big,

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and I could breathe a little
and it would come up a little,

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and I was aware that
all I was was awareness,

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
that I had been there all along.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:90%
This was the sensation.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I had always been there,
there was nowhere to go,

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing to do,
there was nothing to fix,

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:90%
there was nothing to become.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
It was complete, I
was complete, whole,

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and completely fulfilled,
satisfied, satiated--

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.620 align:middle line:90%
you got it, right?

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.390 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing missing,
nothing broken, nothing wrong.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I knew that
every time I took a breath,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
this brilliant light was
coming through this ray

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
and was being transformed into
a vibrational frequency of love.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And that love was
going to the planet.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.545 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that every single
one of us was exactly that.

00:19:29.545 --> 00:19:32.050 align:middle line:90%
That that was all that we were.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And that the degree to which
we were allowing ourselves

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
to breathe and to
simply be, it would

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
enhance the amount of light that
could come through this system

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately land
in this destination

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that we would reference
as the third dimension,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:84%
as this physical realm
that we are operating in.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:90%
Tracking with me?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
This is who we are, this is all
we are, and it is magnificent.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
It is complete and
whole, and what happens

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:84%
is, we as consciousness traverse
that system and land here,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and we forget--

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
we forget that that's
what it's all about.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the landing,
the compression

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.240 align:middle line:84%
into the physical dimension
is a little intense

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the
vibratory frequency

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:90%
of those elevated states.

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.370 align:middle line:84%
But our job is to come in
here and pierce ourselves

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
into the density and return to
remembering the truth of who

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
we are so that we can light
up the density simply by being

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.860 align:middle line:90%
here, simply by remembering.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And the busier we
get at doing to try

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish or achieve or
fit in or belong or do or prove

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:84%
or affect something, the more we
squeeze down and compress down

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.290 align:middle line:84%
our ability to do that,
our ability to allow

00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
happen what is intended to be
happening just by our presence

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:01.410 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.560 align:middle line:90%
You got this?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So literally by
doing less busyness,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.610 align:middle line:84%
we are able to allow
this flow to occur.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So what I knew in that
moment was this-- that's it.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly all
that we have to do,

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and we have to completely
live from that disposition

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And so I came back
into the room,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how long
I was in that state--

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
it didn't matter because
I'm still in that state

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and I've always
been in that state.

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And then as I
remembered that that's

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the truth of what's
happening there,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
it is allowed to happen here
through this very conversation,

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.310 align:middle line:90%
through this.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens is a
transmission, what

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
happens is an activation
of you on a cellular level,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:90%
on a very DNA level.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
We are activating and
transmuting discordant energies

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and allowing the truth to be
aligned again, to be remembered

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and to be awakened
within our system.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Got that?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:90%
Tracking?

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So as we do so, what happens
is everything changes.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
We start to pull ourselves
back from the splat.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:84%
I want to just share with you
for a moment how it works.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Basically your mind operates
like a really rapidly-moving

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
ceiling fan, it's just
spinning and spinning

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:90%
and spinning and spinning.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's spinning so
fast, that the real you,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.390 align:middle line:84%
this essential self
that is here harbored

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:84%
underneath your thinking mind
can't begin to get through.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we meditate,
we try to stop that

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:90%
so that this can get through.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
If we're not very
good at meditating,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:90%
that's a little trickier.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.450 align:middle line:84%
But there are other things
that we can do essentially

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.180 align:middle line:84%
to slow the mind
down enough that we

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.540 align:middle line:84%
can get in tandem with
it and sneak through

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and experience ourselves
beyond the thinking mind, OK?

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
As we do so, anything
and everything

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to allow the
mind to be stilled or slowed

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
allows this essential
self, the true you,

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to rise up through that and
have an experience of yourself

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:90%
as these pictures are depicting.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.060 align:middle line:90%
So this is the real you.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
to do, and what I'm

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be teaching more so
in the workshop on Monday here,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is how to allow what I'm
describing to take place

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
more easily, more
readily, more quickly,

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
more efficiently,
more effectively.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what we
have to do is start

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to have an understanding about
how it all works together.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy-- and I'm
certainly not the first person

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to stand here and speak
about we are rays of light,

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
we are here to
allow love and light

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.350 align:middle line:84%
to pass through our
system, and the degree

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to which we can do
that allows us to heal,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
and it allows us to have a
healing and unifying effect

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%
on everyone around us.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.320 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to
dial into a frequency

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
where we can think
in terms of both/and,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and we can think in terms
of unity consciousness,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and we can bring pieces
and people and places

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and circumstances together
in a frequency that serves.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.922 align:middle line:90%
We can return to our true self.

00:24:11.922 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly not the
first person to say that,

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.080 align:middle line:84%
but what happened in my life
after what I experienced

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.640 align:middle line:84%
might make a difference
in your life,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and that's why I'm here today.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Because I spent the
next 10 years of my life

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:84%
figuring out how to return
to this state on command,

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:90%
how to be in this place.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I recognized was that
we don't live in our bodies.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:37.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't live in a
grounded-enough way

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
to allow our consciousness
to rise to such frequencies.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And so consequently,
we are obsessed

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
with an out-of-body experience
or a near-death experience

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
in order to have some
semblance of this experience,

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.300 align:middle line:90%
to have access to it.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is, we can't
do it necessarily on command.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:84%
We can't get there from here
because, folks, our destination

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:90%
is to come here.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.680 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, we're
seeking spirit.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.140 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to
recognize is that we

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.330 align:middle line:84%
are made of that
which we are seeking,

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.620 align:middle line:84%
which is why we do not find
it when we set out to find it.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.730 align:middle line:90%
We are what we're looking for.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's not out
there, it's in here.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So the first time somebody
said, all of your answers

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.470 align:middle line:84%
are inside you, like
grasshopper, right?

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
I look and I'm like, great.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I got this question, I
look inside for the answer,

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:34.440 align:middle line:84%
I can't see the answer, now
I'm double-duped, right?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a question,
and I apparently

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
answer, so now I'm

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.470 align:middle line:84%
doubly fearful, doubly
afraid or questioning

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:44.190 align:middle line:90%
my whole perspective.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what I began
to recognize was

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have access to
these out-of-body experiences

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
or these near-death
experiences in the exception

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.780 align:middle line:84%
of circumstances
causing that to happen

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
coincidentally or perhaps
in certain vibrational

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:90%
states as well.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
But what I also find is
that the individual who

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.490 align:middle line:84%
has those experiences
doesn't necessarily

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.540 align:middle line:84%
embody the experience,
and doesn't necessarily

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.320 align:middle line:84%
heal themselves because of
it, and doesn't necessarily

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.910 align:middle line:84%
allow it or know how to
have it serve their life

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:84%
experience in such a fashion
that they are grounded

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and they are effective
and they are more

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
governing of their life
experience and creative

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and manifesting the
things, the life that they

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.880 align:middle line:90%
would like to be manifesting.

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And so what I know is that all
of it is supposed to happen.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.820 align:middle line:84%
That we are supposed to
have enlightenment which

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is what happened in
this moment for me,

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.970 align:middle line:84%
but we're also supposed
to engage in embodiment

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
if we truly want it to make
a difference in our life

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
here on Earth.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.110 align:middle line:90%
So you are made of spirit.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Your destination is to
become fully spirit, fully

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
who you are in this
body, in this form.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So are you familiar
with epigenetics?

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:09.940 align:middle line:90%
Epigenetics?

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
OK, so epigenetics
is, of course, the--

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.615 align:middle line:84%
anybody not familiar
with epigenetics?

00:27:14.615 --> 00:27:15.740 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm happy to roll--

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:16.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say that
it is this study that

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
is revealing to us that our
genetic inheritance is not

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.082 align:middle line:84%
the be-all, end-all when
it comes to their health

00:27:27.082 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:84%
conditions that we will have,
the way that we will manifest

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.090 align:middle line:84%
in our lives, the way that
things will go, what we can

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
anticipate, our characteristics,
our qualities, et cetera.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.022 align:middle line:90%
It's a default mechanism.

00:27:37.022 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not the one that we're
supposed to be utilizing,

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.950 align:middle line:90%
but it is there.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And so the very
next thing that we

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.740 align:middle line:84%
are recognizing
through epigenetics

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.660 align:middle line:84%
is that what
governs the behavior

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:49.850 align:middle line:84%
of the cell inside
the body, what

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
governs the behavior is the
environment, not your DNA

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:90%
inheritance.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.650 align:middle line:84%
And so there are little antennas
on the surface of your cells,

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:00.800 align:middle line:84%
little antennas that are picking
up vibratory frequencies,

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:84%
little radio
station frequencies.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And the message, the
quality of the message that

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is received from
that antenna is going

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:84%
to determine what goes
on inside that cell.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
What gets turned on, what
chemistries start happening,

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.170 align:middle line:84%
what chemicals that cell
produces, et cetera.

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to get
that basically you

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
are a cosmic being, you are
made of every single vibrational

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.810 align:middle line:90%
frequency that exists.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And your job here on Earth
is to develop your ability

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
to perceive that, and to
receive the cosmic information

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.320 align:middle line:84%
the universal
intelligence that is

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to bombard your
system every millisecond, OK?

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, that process
is going to allow you to heal.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:47.140 align:middle line:84%
It's going to allow
you to awaken.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.200 align:middle line:84%
It is going to allow you to be
the being that you came here

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.000 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is
one of the ways

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that this is starting
to take place,

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to tie these
things together for you.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetics is showing us
that the antennas on the cell,

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
they transfer information inside
the cell from outside the cell,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.943 align:middle line:84%
and then the cell shows up
and produces a life on Earth

00:29:09.943 --> 00:29:11.860 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's in
accordance with the message

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.180 align:middle line:90%
that it's receiving.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what
it's telling us

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we aren't driving
our lives most effectively.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't drive our
lives from our mind

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that tells our body what to do.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Our body is
receiving information

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
that tells our mind
what to do if we're

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:90%
using our circuits properly.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.430 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.600 align:middle line:90%
It's in reverse.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why we are destined
to change how we are living.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.420 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
There are 11 billion
bits of information

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
that are bombarding your
energy field every millisecond.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.870 align:middle line:84%
11 billion bits of information
that are bombarding you every

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:90%
millisecond.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, your mind can only handle
like 11 of those and only

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.240 align:middle line:90%
one-and-a-half at a time, OK?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:84%
But where those 11 billion
bits of information land

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:04.220 align:middle line:90%
is actually in your gut.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you make a decision
based on your gut feelings,

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
you're making a decision based
on billions of times more

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:16.180 align:middle line:84%
information than your analytical
mind is trying to process, OK?

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So obviously we need to
become more able to sense

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.800 align:middle line:84%
and to perceive and to
feel those 11 billion bits

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
of information
that are coming in.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.290 align:middle line:90%
You've got this?

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
This is what I started coming
upon when I wanted to reproduce

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.930 align:middle line:90%
this experience for myself.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.270 align:middle line:84%
When I wanted to
reproduce that, I

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.480 align:middle line:84%
had to recreate what were
the circumstances that

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.000 align:middle line:84%
were going on in the moment
that that first lit up.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:90%
What was happening to me?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Well I was sitting down,
staking a claim for myself

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:84%
for the first time in my life
in a way bigger than anything

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I had ever done before.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I was breathing in
a different pattern

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.340 align:middle line:90%
than I had ever done before.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I was sending a vibrational
tone through my body,

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.300 align:middle line:84%
through these sacred chants
of Sanskrit that were--

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.280 align:middle line:84%
they were new to me,
but at the moment

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I started doing all
those things together,

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
there was a combination
lock that opened up,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and I shot out through my
believing perfectionistic

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:90%
trying--

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:84%
over-trying mind and found
the truth of who I am.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And so this was made
accessible because

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.990 align:middle line:90%
of a vibrational recipe.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:90%
You get that?

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:84%
So 11 billion bits
of information,

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:84%
this is what I
began to discover.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.300 align:middle line:84%
I had to be in my
body to receive--

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:90%
to perceive what was going on.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:84%
If I was floating around
or living in my head,

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.480 align:middle line:90%
it never worked.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.903 align:middle line:84%
When we're living in our
heads, we're not in our body,

00:31:36.903 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and here's what I
want you to get.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.190 align:middle line:84%
This entire body, this
entire physicality

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:90%
is compressed energy.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Your body is compressed energy.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
You are made of infinite
energy of the unified field,

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and to create physical matter--
this is just a law of physics--

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:84%
to create physical matter, all
they do is compress energy.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Physical matter is
compressed energy.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So when you are in a body,
you have compressed yourself

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:84%
into this state, into this
dimension to get here--

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.490 align:middle line:90%
it's a compressive force.

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
here, you feel confined,

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.540 align:middle line:84%
you feel compressed,
because you are, OK?

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you had an understanding
about how to work with that,

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:23.560 align:middle line:90%
it becomes beneficial to you.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.590 align:middle line:84%
You see that it's a way
of grounding yourself

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of
anchoring yourself here

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.600 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
continue to perceive

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:90%
the rest of who you are.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.920 align:middle line:84%
So that you come into
this physical world,

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of you can
come sooner than later.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But right now
what's happening is,

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.000 align:middle line:90%
we're operating as just this.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.400 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're
operating as just that

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.010 align:middle line:84%
without even realizing
how energy flows

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and who you really are
as an energy being.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
So I want to share with you
what I came to recognize,

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that every single one of these
layers that we call the Chakra

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
system, they don't
just represent

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.690 align:middle line:84%
colors and musical
notes that you

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.480 align:middle line:84%
want to activate in
one way or another,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:84%
they are representing
levels of awareness,

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.770 align:middle line:90%
levels of consciousness.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:84%
There are levels
of consciousness

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:84%
associated with each layer
of your body this way.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So you are this huge
array of light--

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.960 align:middle line:90%
this, this is this, OK?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You are this dropping in to the
Earth, and you hit the Earth,

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and then you rise back up.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is, can you rise
and awaken to who you are?

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:84%
If you can, you'll keep
awakening all the way up

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.210 align:middle line:84%
to this Godhead, up to
your own higher self.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.580 align:middle line:90%
You will be able to do that.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.065 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do that,
there's a reason.

00:33:46.065 --> 00:33:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't because you're
broken or something's missing

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:90%
or you're just too wobbly.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:84%
That you just don't-- well, it
might be because you're wobbly,

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:53.670 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to show
you how to fix that, OK?

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:56.087 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you what
wobbly is all about, all right?

00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.420 align:middle line:90%
This energy is you.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So the energy of energy
medicine is the real you.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:07.550 align:middle line:84%
The energy of consciousness, of
meditation, it's the real you.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:09.980 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something
you're trying to access,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and this is what we have
to change if we're ever

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.010 align:middle line:84%
going to develop as a
conscious community in the way

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are ultimately
destined to develop.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:23.510 align:middle line:84%
If we are to truly own who
we are and what we're doing

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:84%
and why we're here
and how to proceed

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
as a multidimensional
being operating

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.389 align:middle line:84%
in the third
dimension masterfully,

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to have to
change some radical things.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Because what quantum
science is teaching

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.000 align:middle line:84%
us is that there is only one
of us here, and that it's you.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.500 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] When I first heard
that, I'm like, which one of us

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.300 align:middle line:90%
is it?

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.219 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:47.201 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm here.

00:34:47.201 --> 00:34:48.409 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel like you're here?

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:49.909 align:middle line:90%
Like, which one?

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Because we're so used
to operating this way.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.250 align:middle line:84%
We're used to being
a separate self,

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.490 align:middle line:84%
we're used to being an
isolated entity that's

00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect,
when in actuality,

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:84%
all we need to do is stop
separating ourselves so much

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.050 align:middle line:84%
and allow the union that
we're made of to have its way.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.830 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, you have
to slow down the ceiling fan.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to slow it down, OK?

00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:17.570 align:middle line:84%
So in the process of doing
that, what happens is,

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:84%
we have to kick in to
allowing this exact process

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
You compress yourself in order
to go to the third dimension.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.930 align:middle line:84%
I have active memory of the
moment that I chose to become.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was as if
a word was spoken,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
and the word was, yes, I am, OK?

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.110 align:middle line:90%
It was as if that was spoken.

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:84%
It felt through my system
just like a huge command

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:50.070 align:middle line:84%
was happening, and I
was in response to that.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was a moment of
choosing to become.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The next thing
that I experienced

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:56.922 align:middle line:90%
was a tremendous dissension--

00:35:56.922 --> 00:35:58.880 align:middle line:84%
dropping and dropping
and dropping and dropping

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and dropping and
landing in the womb.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.890 align:middle line:84%
I have memory of
being in the womb,

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:90%
just sitting exactly like this.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Completely aware that this was
a gig, this was my journey,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.560 align:middle line:84%
this was my choice,
and I'm ready to roll.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.360 align:middle line:84%
And then coming
through the birth

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.030 align:middle line:84%
canal, another
compression, I completely

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.722 align:middle line:90%
forgot about it, all right?

00:36:18.722 --> 00:36:20.180 align:middle line:84%
You ever been in
an elevator that's

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.980 align:middle line:90%
just too packed to even think?

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like here, right?

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.670 align:middle line:90%
This is what we're doing here.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:27.260 align:middle line:84%
We're too compressed
and too packed

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.860 align:middle line:84%
in to have it really
be accessible.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.560 align:middle line:84%
To have the vibrational
frequency, moving enough

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.390 align:middle line:90%
to be able to perceive it.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Get this-- you are 10
to 100 to 10,000 times

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:43.310 align:middle line:84%
more sensory than motor
in your nervous system.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You are a sensory
being by design,

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:84%
but we are obsessed
with what to do--

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.370 align:middle line:84%
motor action, what do I
do to make life better.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.750 align:middle line:90%
You're a sensory being.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:57.140 align:middle line:84%
The object is, I have to
learn how to perceive more.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I have to learn how to perceive
the subtle anatomy of me.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Because this is
who we have thought

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:84%
we are, and this
is actually who we.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Are a subtle energy being.

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.710 align:middle line:90%
We are a spirit being.

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.320 align:middle line:84%
I have access to perceiving
what is referenced

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.310 align:middle line:84%
as the Holy Ghost, this
holy, misty substance,

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.910 align:middle line:84%
this white, misty substance
that exists throughout-- inside

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:90%
and outside this body.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.880 align:middle line:84%
I have access to that, and
when I dial my mind into it

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and follow it, it
leads me in the path

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:84%
that is the ultimate
destination of my life.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
want every human being

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.860 align:middle line:84%
to begin to have access to,
because we're built for it.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not only built for
it, we're built of it,

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and we just have
never been taught

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.540 align:middle line:90%
how to masterfully manage it--

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.640 align:middle line:84%
manage the system,
the faculties,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.840 align:middle line:84%
the abundant, magnificent
aspects of our wholeness

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.182 align:middle line:84%
and pull them together
in one unified fashion.

00:37:53.182 --> 00:37:54.890 align:middle line:84%
So those are the kinds
of things that I'm

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.780 align:middle line:84%
going to start teaching
in the workshop

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.280 align:middle line:84%
when we have a
little bit more time.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.110 align:middle line:84%
But what I want you
to get right now

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:84%
is that you compress
yourself, you

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.130 align:middle line:84%
descend into this dimension,
and you hit the ground

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:08.880 align:middle line:90%
and you rise back up.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the
circuitry in place,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.990 align:middle line:84%
both electromagnetic
circuitry and neurocircuitry,

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.218 align:middle line:84%
but the electromagnetic
circuitry

00:38:19.218 --> 00:38:21.010 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
your nervous system,

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:90%
did you know that?

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.650 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there's a
system running your body that

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is more profoundly significant
than your nervous system--

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.173 align:middle line:90%
than your brain?

00:38:27.173 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Because we are so
obsessed with studying

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.990 align:middle line:84%
the brain and its processing,
the electromagnetic energy

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.300 align:middle line:84%
system, the system
that you truly are,

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.540 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic energy
system built the nervous system

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:90%
in the developing embryo, OK?

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.630 align:middle line:84%
So it not only built it, it
controls it, it manages it.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.460 align:middle line:90%
It gives it instructions.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system is
constantly responding to that.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Those little messages
that the antennas

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.202 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of yourself, you
know what they're picking up?

00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
They're picking up
electromagnetic energy

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.538 align:middle line:90%
waveforms.

00:38:55.538 --> 00:38:56.830 align:middle line:90%
That's what they're picking up.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:57.630 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:58.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the real you.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It's that invisible you, the
spirit self, the higher self.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.360 align:middle line:84%
The one that got thrown under
the bus when you started

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:84%
getting made fun of for all
the things that you knew

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:84%
or that you were
aware of or that--

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.730 align:middle line:84%
those little inklings
or those hunches

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
or the imagination
or the gut feeling?

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.250 align:middle line:90%
All of that is you.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.300 align:middle line:90%
It's the real you.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And your mind has been clueless.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.560 align:middle line:84%
When we landed and
we splatted, we

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.810 align:middle line:90%
came up attached to the mind.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.350 align:middle line:84%
We think we are the mind, and
we have to get it off of us

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and teach it that it's to serve
us instead of it controlling

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.830 align:middle line:90%
us, you follow?

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says that we were
given this beautiful gift

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.780 align:middle line:84%
of the intuitive-- actually,
you are the intuitive--

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and you were given
this less rational mind

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:90%
to act as its loyal servant.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And we've developed a culture
that honors the servant instead

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.470 align:middle line:90%
of the gift, you got that?

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course
you guys get that,

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because you're at a
Conscious Life Expo--

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.930 align:middle line:90%
you're onto it, right?

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:90%
We're like, yeah, gotcha, OK?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I got you, too, and I
know how to teach you how

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:90%
to do something about all that.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I'm here, OK?

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.740 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have the circuitry
in place to masterfully manage

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:14.590 align:middle line:84%
this energy, then the
energy just wobbles and gets

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:84%
dispersed and gets splatted,
and that's the life

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:90%
that we've been living.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.490 align:middle line:84%
We've been living life
dispersed and splatted,

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.170 align:middle line:84%
making our best
efforts every time

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.270 align:middle line:84%
we could come into contact
with something that

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.670 align:middle line:84%
seemed like a good idea,
that something that seemed

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:30.062 align:middle line:84%
like that's surely must be
how I'm supposed to operate,

00:40:30.062 --> 00:40:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and I have to do more of
this and less of that.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.710 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, it's more of
this and less of that--

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.543 align:middle line:84%
no, no, it's some of
this and some of that--

00:40:35.543 --> 00:40:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and we get confused.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.670 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to operate,
and we can't make sense out

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of all of the varied
instructions out there.

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:44.170 align:middle line:90%
So I just want you to get this.

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:45.380 align:middle line:90%
You've got this.

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.430 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
come home to yourself.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:49.660 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
drop inside your body,

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:84%
learn to breathe in your belly,
learn to hook up circuitry

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So that this system can
operate the way that it

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.400 align:middle line:90%
was designed to.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the indigenous
peoples lived this way,

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:04.860 align:middle line:90%
but we became more advanced.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Or shall we say lost?

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And the idea is this--

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:12.780 align:middle line:84%
we want to put our
advancements together

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.770 align:middle line:90%
with our indigenous truth.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we put them
together, everything

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.880 align:middle line:90%
begins to make sense.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.400 align:middle line:84%
We begin to roll in a very
different way in this life.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:90%
So here's how it works.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You drop in, you hit the Earth,
you rise up through this.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.750 align:middle line:84%
You get as high as you can
given the circuits that you have

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.170 align:middle line:84%
in place, and then the
energy starts to fall around,

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.735 align:middle line:84%
and then you just recycle it
and recycle it and recycle it.

00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:36.450 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So this creates ultimately
the whole physical body.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.470 align:middle line:84%
It creates a place,
a space where

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:84%
these levels of consciousness
can coalesce and exist

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and kind of organize.

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And then depending
upon how much we

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:52.800 align:middle line:84%
awaken in the
course of our life,

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
we can shoot up higher before
it falls around, et cetera.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Here's what happens.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:03.480 align:middle line:84%
When we don't have the idea
that our personal power,

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:84%
for instance, and
our ability to love

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.910 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to
be connected, when

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:13.210 align:middle line:84%
we don't have that as a
walking, working reality,

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:17.100 align:middle line:84%
we think we either have
to be loving or powerful,

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.360 align:middle line:90%
or we'll be a doormat.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.160 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So we jump to our power so
that we're not a doormat.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Or we don't realize
that relationship,

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.260 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of where the
second chakra area is starting

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.663 align:middle line:90%
to speak into--

00:42:29.663 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:84%
not just relationship
with people,

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.780 align:middle line:84%
but relationship with time,
relationship with space,

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.590 align:middle line:84%
relationship with the
mind, the relationship

00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:40.140 align:middle line:84%
between the spirit, the
soulful self, and the mind--

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.990 align:middle line:84%
all these relationships
are qualified

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in this energy of the second
chakra area, that second chakra

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.860 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So if that's not connected
to your personal power

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:84%
or if it's not connected to your
groundedness, then what happens

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is, this rising energy
starts to pick up a wobble.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:58.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like there is a
gap in the circuitry.

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
pick up a wobble--

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:90%
some of you can see this--

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.940 align:middle line:84%
the gaps in circuitry start
to cause this to wobble.

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
When this wobbles, this
field becomes distorted.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:11.580 align:middle line:84%
When that field
becomes distorted,

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.500 align:middle line:84%
your standing with
your awareness

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:18.090 align:middle line:84%
inside here looking out
through a distorted field.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.310 align:middle line:84%
The field of energies that
you're looking through

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:22.470 align:middle line:84%
is distorted itself,
and so you see

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:84%
things that validate your
greatest fears, or that

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:84%
validate your
inconsistencies, or that

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.730 align:middle line:90%
validate your insecurities.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And so it continues to
perpetuate the cycle,

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.850 align:middle line:84%
particularly when we
are oriented to receive

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:38.600 align:middle line:84%
and perceive from
the outer world.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.880 align:middle line:84%
There's an area in your brain
called the Cave of Brahma that

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:90%
is constantly receiving--

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.140 align:middle line:90%
it's the third ventricle.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Inside the third ventricle, the
pineal gland sits in the back,

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's sitting as
if it's in the back

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.370 align:middle line:84%
of a cave, a small cave,
and it's just sitting there.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland-- did
you know that the pineal is

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.020 align:middle line:90%
made of rods and cones?

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.870 align:middle line:84%
The light receptor cells
similar to your eyeballs?

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.667 align:middle line:90%
Did you know that?

00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got to tell you
the significance of this.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's super cool.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.580 align:middle line:84%
I loved it when I
first studied this.

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.500 align:middle line:84%
The light that-- there
is no window, right?

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.042 align:middle line:84%
There's nose socket for
it to look at anything.

00:44:16.042 --> 00:44:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And so what is it perceiving?

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Well it's perceiving
light, but it's

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:20.670 align:middle line:84%
perceiving light of
a higher frequency

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.040 align:middle line:84%
than we see with our
two physical eyes, OK?

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We have a non-physical
eye, an eye

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.860 align:middle line:84%
that sees the etheric, the
ether-- the ethereal world.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And it is that which
opened in me that

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:33.180 align:middle line:90%
allowed me to remember this.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And so being raised in a
natural health care environment,

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.510 align:middle line:84%
working with patients in a
natural healing capacity,

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I turn my life into
a living laboratory

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:43.980 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
codify, how to work

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.690 align:middle line:84%
with exactly what is required
to get this foundation

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.880 align:middle line:90%
stable enough that my system--

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.080 align:middle line:84%
that your system could
perceive opening that third eye

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and being able to receive
or perceive yourself

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.780 align:middle line:84%
as the multidimensional
being that you are.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.360 align:middle line:84%
When there's a wobble
here, the third eye

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.540 align:middle line:84%
won't open unless,
of course, you

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.120 align:middle line:84%
take something that
makes it open, which

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:12.390 align:middle line:84%
is another popular fad
that we're into right now

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.820 align:middle line:84%
with ayahuasca and
mushrooms and all

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.740 align:middle line:84%
of these-- the
psychotropic drugs--

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.180 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing is all seeking
the very thing I started

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.440 align:middle line:90%
speaking about today.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.170 align:middle line:90%
We want to know who we are.

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:27.540 align:middle line:90%
We want to know who we are.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And all you have to do
is accept and drop in

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and come home to yourself
in such a fashion

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:38.590 align:middle line:90%
that that knowing is automatic.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.260 align:middle line:84%
You are given
everything that you

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:44.290 align:middle line:84%
need to have that knowing
you are you are made of it,

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:45.090 align:middle line:90%
you got that?

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:90%
You're made of it.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't something
out there to go

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:51.570 align:middle line:84%
pursue, it's something
to drop in here

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and feel and sense and find.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.530 align:middle line:90%
You're a sensory being.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:59.070 align:middle line:84%
You are built to be able to
sense the billions of bits

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of information
that are bombarding

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.910 align:middle line:84%
your system every
millisecond, and you

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:05.940 align:middle line:84%
are built to be able
to self-administer,

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.660 align:middle line:84%
build the circuitry to
rise without a wobble.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you rise
without the wobble

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.400 align:middle line:84%
you create a stable
enough foundation

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.920 align:middle line:84%
that your third eye
can vibrationally

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.220 align:middle line:90%
we get tapped and open.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And as it opens, you
become aware of the truth

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.630 align:middle line:90%
of who you are.

00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.650 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea walking
around on this planet

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:32.140 align:middle line:84%
as the masses are of
what I'm talking about.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The masses do not know
this, but know this--

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.550 align:middle line:84%
they are holding a space
for you to awaken to it.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.300 align:middle line:84%
There are people
that are carrying

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.510 align:middle line:84%
a vibrational frequency
that is grounded,

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
that is heavier than the
frequencies of those who

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:84%
meditate, those who
are capturing the yes,

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:55.980 align:middle line:84%
those that are exploring
and expounding and finding

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.850 align:middle line:84%
their own divine presence
and embodying it.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:05.370 align:middle line:84%
They are able to find that
because of opposing vibrations.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.110 align:middle line:90%
So let me say it this way.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.650 align:middle line:84%
The tree deepens its roots
so that it can grow taller.

00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:16.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to deepen your
roots to grow taller.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So the one being
that is our culture

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.760 align:middle line:84%
collectively is
being depicted to you

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:28.080 align:middle line:84%
by people who would not be
sitting in this room today,

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.730 align:middle line:84%
would not be interested in
this kind of a conversation,

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.370 align:middle line:90%
they are the grounders.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:33.360 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They actually are allowing you
to raise your own consciousness

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.330 align:middle line:84%
higher because of the density
that they are holding.

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.130 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.433 align:middle line:84%
And we have a prejudice
against density, all right?

00:47:46.433 --> 00:47:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't go home and
say, oh you must

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:48.975 align:middle line:90%
be one of my dense friends.

00:47:48.975 --> 00:47:50.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not going
to be well-received, OK?

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to go
in like I mean it.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to get this on a
personal level, it's also true.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Inside of you, the same
thing is happening.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.970 align:middle line:84%
There are parts
of you that aren't

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.000 align:middle line:84%
ready to elevate because
the circuits aren't

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.670 align:middle line:84%
in place to feel a
stabilized sense of self.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It gets too wobbly and
you get freaked out,

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.080 align:middle line:84%
so you back off
a little bit, OK?

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.260 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is learn
that everything is energy.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:84%
It's energy-- it's not
story, it's energy.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:20.620 align:middle line:90%
It's just energy.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not drama,
it's just energy.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.635 align:middle line:90%
It's not pain, it's just energy.

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
you're left behind,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.750 align:middle line:84%
it's just an energy
that you're feeling.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're angry,
you're feeling an energy.

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:32.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you're afraid,
it's a certain vibration.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have to learn how to
create an environment where

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.360 align:middle line:84%
unity consciousness
exists where you are not

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.430 align:middle line:84%
prejudice against
any vibration that

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:90%
passes through your system.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Because all of them
are required for you

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to awaken to the truth of
who you are-- literally,

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.570 align:middle line:84%
physically, they're
all required.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain, OK?

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting a little
passionate about this.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:54.100 align:middle line:90%
Arrgh!

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:54.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I get passionate
about it because I

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:59.020 align:middle line:84%
know every single one of you
can have every single thing

00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:90%
that you want.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.650 align:middle line:90%
You can have it.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:02.650 align:middle line:90%
You can heal your body--

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.023 align:middle line:84%
I healed the scoliosis
in my body and my spine.

00:49:05.023 --> 00:49:05.940 align:middle line:90%
You know what that is?

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Curvature of the spine?

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Curvature of the spine that
looked exactly like that

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.680 align:middle line:90%
wobble right there.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.470 align:middle line:90%
Turns out, it's exactly--

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
the physical body
is a reflection

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:14.950 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
with the energy flowing

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:15.808 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:49:15.808 --> 00:49:17.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have a hitch
in your get-along

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.030 align:middle line:84%
or you have a crick
in your neck or you

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:84%
have migraine headaches,
which I also had,

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.340 align:middle line:90%
there's a reason for it.

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.923 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
energy is not flowing

00:49:23.923 --> 00:49:27.710 align:middle line:84%
through your system the way that
it is supposed to in that area.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And so your body is compensating
for that, and it's making do,

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.427 align:middle line:84%
and you can change
how the energy is

00:49:33.427 --> 00:49:34.510 align:middle line:90%
flowing through your body.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.233 align:middle line:84%
You can learn to
build the circuitry,

00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I'm
teaching people, OK?

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.660 align:middle line:84%
So I have a book coming
out in a couple of weeks

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:41.900 align:middle line:90%
that is all about that.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:43.300 align:middle line:90%
It's called "The Energy Codes."

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.540 align:middle line:84%
You can go online right
now and preorder it.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It's coming out March 19,
and it's filled with how-tos.

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.692 align:middle line:84%
How to stop the wobble, how to
build the circuits, et cetera.

00:49:52.692 --> 00:49:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to share
some of those ideas

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:84%
with you in the
workshop on Monday,

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and I so look forward
to doing that,

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.070 align:middle line:84%
because it's
exactly what we need

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.310 align:middle line:84%
to know how to do to change
what is happening inside of us.

00:50:04.310 --> 00:50:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:09.752 align:middle line:84%
When you are angry, how many
people like to be angry?

00:50:09.752 --> 00:50:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever raises your
hand on this, you know.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I get it, all right?

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So how many of you like to be
sad or depressed, all right?

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, we have
our favorites, right?

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.760 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
like to be joyful?

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:19.555 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:50:19.555 --> 00:50:20.500 align:middle line:90%
See how we are?

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.300 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have a prejudice
against certain energies

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:26.380 align:middle line:84%
and we like other energies,
and this is causing

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.100 align:middle line:90%
a huge problem in our culture.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Because if we could just start
to look at it as energy instead

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.900 align:middle line:84%
of good ones and bad ones--
good emotions, bad emotions;

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.320 align:middle line:84%
good thoughts, bad
thoughts; negative thoughts,

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.590 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts; if we
would stop that and lay it

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:45.670 align:middle line:84%
down and just be
all-embracing of all of us,

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.310 align:middle line:84%
then we would start to
model, first of all,

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.000 align:middle line:84%
for the universe what unity
consciousness actually is.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And if we would do that,
what comes next is we heal.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:58.900 align:middle line:84%
What comes next after that
is we heal each other.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:00.520 align:middle line:90%
We heal because of each other.

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:84%
We show each other
how to do this.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.420 align:middle line:90%
So think about it this way--

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:11.410 align:middle line:84%
anger, fear, depression,
sadness, angst, worry--

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:13.023 align:middle line:84%
what are some of
your favorite flavors

00:51:13.023 --> 00:51:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that you would
avoid at all costs?

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.240 align:middle line:90%
What else you got?

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Guilt, shame?

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:17.480 align:middle line:90%
Those are great ones.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.280 align:middle line:90%
Great ones.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Pardon?

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Grief.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Grief.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Grief, guilt, shame, these
are awesome energies, OK?

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, I was
starting to like her

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and now she's
talking really crazy.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.210 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:51:28.210 --> 00:51:29.890 align:middle line:84%
These are awesome
energies because they

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:31.500 align:middle line:90%
are grounding energies.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:32.740 align:middle line:90%
They're anchoring energies.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:33.540 align:middle line:90%
They're heavy.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:35.165 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they're heavy,
but you know what?

00:51:35.165 --> 00:51:36.970 align:middle line:84%
If you had a way
of connecting those

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.970 align:middle line:84%
to all of your experiences, your
energies, your emotional states

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:44.090 align:middle line:84%
of elation and bliss and
love and joy and what else?

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:46.140 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
your other favorites?

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Jealousy.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> No your-- the other--

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.768 align:middle line:84%
I'm at the other end
of the spectrum now.

00:51:49.768 --> 00:51:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Jealousy would be
good on the other end.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:52.980 align:middle line:90%
Ecstasy.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:53.780 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Surrender.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Surrender, it's
kind of in the middle.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the bridge, right?

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:90%
So you get this?

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.320 align:middle line:84%
These are
high-frequency energies.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Exaltation, joy,
bliss, delight, love.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.230 align:middle line:84%
These are
high-frequency energies.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And these low-frequency
energies of shame, guilt, fear,

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.730 align:middle line:84%
depression, grief, these
are just anchoring energies.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:17.420 align:middle line:84%
These energies, when
embraced, allow you to root.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:84%
When you can come present
to those energies,

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.260 align:middle line:90%
your roots go deeper.

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.240 align:middle line:84%
When your roots go deeper, you
can have these experiences.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.820 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
is, our culture

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:28.520 align:middle line:84%
is trying to just have
these without having these.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.340 align:middle line:84%
We try to escape 50%
of the human experience

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and expect to be whole.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It will never
happen, folks, never.

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:37.970 align:middle line:84%
I watched my father in
health care help people

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.085 align:middle line:84%
way before energy medicine was a
conversation to be had, and I--

00:52:42.085 --> 00:52:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't right now,
but I will, OK?

00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:49.700 align:middle line:84%
I watched him stick
to the focus of holism

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.060 align:middle line:84%
and holistic medicine and
holistic health care in a world

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.640 align:middle line:84%
where even holistic health
care practitioners were trying

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to get identified by the
allopathic approach that

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.300 align:middle line:84%
is a totally opposite direction,
a mechanistic approach.

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.930 align:middle line:90%
It will never work.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.290 align:middle line:84%
You will never find the
cure because these diseases

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.310 align:middle line:90%
are the cure.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The diseases are an
out-picturing showing you

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.812 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
embracing your wholeness.

00:53:11.812 --> 00:53:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
embracing your wholeness,

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:15.450 align:middle line:90%
the condition would go away.

00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But we name it,
and then we think

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.540 align:middle line:84%
it's a thing that we have to
fight against we created it

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.530 align:middle line:90%
by naming it.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't name it, just feel it.

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to just take
you through an exercise,

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:25.490 align:middle line:90%
is that OK?

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Does that work?

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So imagine something
right now that

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:32.960 align:middle line:84%
causes you to feel an
emotion that you don't like.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Anger, fear, hurt,
grief, depression,

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:39.270 align:middle line:84%
sadness, shame, guilt. Pick
your favorite flavor, OK?

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Or your least-favorite
flavor, right?

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.860 align:middle line:84%
Just think of a situation
and feel the feeling.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Now feel this feeling.

00:53:45.110 --> 00:53:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
this feeling, notice,

00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.330 align:middle line:84%
if you take your
attention to the body,

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:52.550 align:middle line:84%
there's an area
inside your body that

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:57.920 align:middle line:84%
is more activated in the middle
of you having this experience.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The middle of you thinking
about this, there's something.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:02.480 align:middle line:84%
You can get a knot in your
stomach, a lump in your throat,

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:03.620 align:middle line:90%
tightness in your chest--

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.120 align:middle line:90%
something happens.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I want you to hug it back, just
squeeze it from the inside.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Just squeeze it,
like OK, got it.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Contact has been made.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.060 align:middle line:84%
My mind is now paying
attention to my body,

00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and they're going
to work together

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.870 align:middle line:90%
to start to shift something, OK?

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:84%
So when you squeeze
it and then you--

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.783 align:middle line:84%
I want you to also hug
your heart on the inside.

00:54:23.783 --> 00:54:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's some other
practices that I'll do.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze the muscles in the
base of your pelvic bowl.

00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:30.860 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like a
Kegal exercise, ladies,

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.068 align:middle line:90%
if you're familiar with that.

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.943 align:middle line:84%
Gentleman, you're about
to learn what a Kegal

00:54:33.943 --> 00:54:35.180 align:middle line:90%
exercise is about, all right?

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if you're
going to the bathroom

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and you had to stop
the stream right away.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.840 align:middle line:84%
You just have to contract
certain muscles, contract

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:42.380 align:middle line:90%
those muscles.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.670 align:middle line:90%
Just contract it, squeeze it.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.545 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it pulls
you out of your head

00:54:45.545 --> 00:54:46.587 align:middle line:90%
and down into your body.

00:54:46.587 --> 00:54:47.420 align:middle line:90%
So you squeeze that.

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.290 align:middle line:90%
Hug your heart.

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:84%
Hug this area, squeeze this
area that has a hold of you.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.330 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze this area that has--

00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that's running your
world right now, OK?

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.620 align:middle line:84%
That's in your chest, your
throat, whatever it is,

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.420 align:middle line:90%
squeeze it.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And now take a breath
from in the Earth,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:03.080 align:middle line:84%
up through the squeezed
pelvic bowl-- it's called

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.630 align:middle line:90%
Mula Bandha, root lock.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:07.520 align:middle line:84%
This Kegal exercise, is
pelvic bowl thing, OK?

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And breathe up
toward your heart.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
You may be coming through the
area that's been activated,

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.850 align:middle line:84%
or maybe that area's
above your heart.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze your heart,
and then exhale up

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.300 align:middle line:84%
through this central
channel of your body,

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and exhale right out
the top of your head.

00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And then take an
inhale from overhead,

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and breathe right down
through your body.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And hug this area, and hug
your heart, squeeze your heart,

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and squeeze these areas in
the base of the pelvic bowl,

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.020 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale
down into the Earth.

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And now take an inhale
up from the Earth

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.015 align:middle line:84%
and breathe right up
to your heart space.

00:55:38.015 --> 00:55:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the belly, not your
upper lobes of your lungs.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in the belly, in and
up through your nose only.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.440 align:middle line:84%
And now exhale right up
through the central channel

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.880 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of your head.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, take a
breath in from overhead,

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:52.220 align:middle line:84%
right down through your core,
right through the heart,

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and come home for yourself.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.035 align:middle line:84%
Come home-- bring all of
your energy right into this.

00:55:56.035 --> 00:55:57.410 align:middle line:84%
It's not an
intellectual process,

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:01.280 align:middle line:84%
it's a felt, intimate,
deep, tender sensation.

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Because it matters.

00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:03.195 align:middle line:90%
Because you matter.

00:56:03.195 --> 00:56:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you're the one that's
going to bridge the worlds,

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.260 align:middle line:90%
and exhale right into the Earth.

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Now you'll notice--
just take a notice.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Think of this situation
and this emotional state.

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.560 align:middle line:84%
You'll start to sense and
feel something shows up

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.300 align:middle line:84%
a little differently
in the body when

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.100 align:middle line:84%
you think of this situation
that carries this emotion.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.900 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel a shift?

00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.942 align:middle line:84%
Anybody feel a shift happen with
the energy that was locked up

00:56:24.942 --> 00:56:26.150 align:middle line:90%
in the body in a certain way?

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hands up.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Sweet.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Now look at this.

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.130 align:middle line:84%
So what this means
is, you're starting

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:34.850 align:middle line:84%
to carve some new energy
based upon a sensation

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that you thought you
were supposed to avoid.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you can
embrace that situation

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and embrace the energy that
goes with it, rather than naming

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.100 align:middle line:84%
it and turning it into a story
and then avoiding the story

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and having to go through the
linear process which takes

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:53.570 align:middle line:84%
days, weeks, months, decades,
lifetimes to process,

00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.960 align:middle line:84%
why not just build the circuitry
to keep your energy flowing

00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:00.440 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows this
toric field flow, which

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:06.200 align:middle line:84%
is measurable, toric field flow
to become less wobbly, less

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.770 align:middle line:84%
distorted, and become
more and more robust?

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately,
this toric field flow

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.530 align:middle line:84%
gets bigger and
bigger and bigger,

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:19.250 align:middle line:84%
until you are flowing with a
state of consciousness that

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:21.620 align:middle line:90%
is accessing your highest self.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.760 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a
grossly-abbreviated version

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of what I would
love to teach you,

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:31.640 align:middle line:84%
but I just want you to
get that if you don't name

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:35.000 align:middle line:84%
your emotional states and you
just let yourself feel them--

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and don't just observe them,
because the mindfulness

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.070 align:middle line:84%
of observation is
great, but it's not

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:42.597 align:middle line:84%
going to build circuitry
as fast as it could.

00:57:42.597 --> 00:57:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And there are many,
many ways that you

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.540 align:middle line:84%
could build the circuitry
to allow your system

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:50.660 align:middle line:84%
to rise without the wobble,
without the distortion

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:53.010 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
stabilize yourself.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It starts by you
being less prejudiced

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.710 align:middle line:84%
about the feelings that
pass through your system

00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.010 align:middle line:90%
that you don't want to have.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you stop not wanting
to have them and start

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.980 align:middle line:84%
wanting to have them
because they're actually

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.320 align:middle line:84%
the energies that are
going to root you deeper,

00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.170 align:middle line:84%
that are going to ground
you with more stability

00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and build a
foundation, what rises

00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:14.570 align:middle line:84%
from that new
foundation goes higher

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:18.050 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of distortion
in the field-- it picks up

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:20.720 align:middle line:84%
momentum when your mind and
your body and your breath

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:21.900 align:middle line:90%
work together.

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.700 align:middle line:90%
So get this.

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:26.645 align:middle line:84%
Your breath in your body is
spirit in the body, right?

00:58:26.645 --> 00:58:28.280 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't make
sense, just stop

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:31.460 align:middle line:90%
breathing for about 10 minutes.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.710 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you're
going to be very clear on

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.778 align:middle line:90%
is where the breath takes you.

00:58:36.778 --> 00:58:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You're going to still
exist, but you're not

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.870 align:middle line:90%
going to be in the body.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:40.830 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.830 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be out
here above the body,

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:46.520 align:middle line:84%
because the breath is the
weaver of spirit into form.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.320 align:middle line:84%
So then the real you resides at
the core of this toric field.

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The real you is deep
in the still waters

00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:58.200 align:middle line:84%
that run way inside, way
underneath the surface.

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.500 align:middle line:90%
And so think of it this way.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.790 align:middle line:84%
The soul speaks to the body,
and the body speaks to the mind,

00:59:04.790 --> 00:59:07.640 align:middle line:90%
and the mind doesn't listen.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.860 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we're at, OK?

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:12.470 align:middle line:84%
We have to get the mind to
pay attention to the body

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:16.520 align:middle line:84%
so that it can read the language
of the soul that is revealing.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is these issues
in our lives start becoming

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:24.650 align:middle line:84%
supportive factors, they become
elements of propelling us

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.440 align:middle line:90%
into our multi-dimensionality.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
land in the body

00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and you build the circuitry
to take the distortion away,

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.780 align:middle line:90%
you see what's real.

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And what's real isn't just
a life here that's easier,

00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:42.680 align:middle line:84%
what's real is that this is
the truth of who you are.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what's real, folks.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.060 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
experiencing life this way,

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:50.180 align:middle line:84%
there's a reason, and
it's a circuitry issue.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:53.720 align:middle line:84%
It's just a circuitry
issue that allows

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.220 align:middle line:90%
you to build enough circuits.

00:59:55.220 --> 00:59:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So what do I mean by that,
when you squeeze this area

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and started to breathe it up
and down the central channel,

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.050 align:middle line:90%
you're creating with your mind--

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:09.183 align:middle line:84%
your mind focuses its attention
on things and they magnify.

01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:10.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that?

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Whatever you pay attention
to, it magnifies.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The power of the mental
field-- the mind field--

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.200 align:middle line:84%
magnifies and
therefore manifests.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we move the
mind in a certain way,

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:25.400 align:middle line:84%
we have an effect on the tiniest
particles of consciousness.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:28.100 align:middle line:90%
The tiniest particles of light--

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that's not really a particle,
but the form of light,

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:35.360 align:middle line:84%
just as it's becoming affiliated
with the physical dimension

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.790 align:middle line:90%
on the spectrum, is a photon.

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.170 align:middle line:90%
You familiar with photons?

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:40.700 align:middle line:90%
Just tiny particles, OK?

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Tiny particles that
are so tiny that when

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
you think about them, when
you think something into them,

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they rearrange in accordance
with your thought, OK?

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Create a vacuum, randomly-placed
photons are in there.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
You think a thought into
that vacuum and the photons

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
arrange in accordance
with what you thought.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah!

01:00:58.310 --> 01:00:59.120 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Well when photons
move around, they

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.190 align:middle line:90%
have an effect on electrons, OK?

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:07.430 align:middle line:84%
When electrons get affected,
you start to en masse,

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
you start to create mass, you
start to create physicality,

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:15.540 align:middle line:84%
it becomes more tangible,
more able to be perceived.

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing with
the energy codes work

01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:21.860 align:middle line:84%
is we're building more
photon density at the core.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when we landed
and we splatted,

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.460 align:middle line:90%
our attention went out there.

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And our faculties, our
senses, our perception

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:29.630 align:middle line:90%
is all about the outer world.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is turn it
inward and build the densities

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and the quickening in
your core so that you

01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
have a subconscious sense of
self that is available to you

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.660 align:middle line:90%
ongoing.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So that you always
know who you are,

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
you don't look out
there to figure it out.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.290 align:middle line:84%
You don't look out there
for feedback for someone

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to tell you who you
are, you feel that you

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
know it, you are that, got it?

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're creating
photon density,

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.970 align:middle line:84%
and we're carving a
pathway of communication

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.490 align:middle line:84%
through this
electromagnetic energy

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
field with our consciousness,
which is who we are,

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.110 align:middle line:90%
and that's all we are.

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You're pure awareness
and that's it.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You're not a thing,
you're availability,

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
that's what you are.

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
You're just here,
observing, creating.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're here to do.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
You're using a mind to
help you manifest things.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:20.480 align:middle line:84%
But when we've been
oriented externally,

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
we are using the mind
to defend ourselves,

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to protect ourselves, because
the outer world looks crazy.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, the outer world
is just a byproduct

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.494 align:middle line:90%
of your own craziness, OK?

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:31.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:32.090 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:35.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a byproduct of you being
in the splat, that's all it is.

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
You're creating in a
splatted kind of way.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it looks like your world
is just distorted and dispersed

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.865 align:middle line:84%
and unfair and
unkind and unloving

01:02:42.865 --> 01:02:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to protect
yourself, and all of that

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
is true only at a certain
level of consciousness.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'd really love to raise
the level of consciousness

01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
in a very tangible, scientific,
realistic, reproducible sort

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:55.620 align:middle line:90%
of way.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.995 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's what I've been
doing for the last 18 years.

01:02:57.995 --> 01:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the community
that I've been studying with me

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.212 align:middle line:84%
are having transformative
impacts in their life.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
They're dealing
with grief, they're

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:07.100 align:middle line:84%
dealing with what looked
like loss, they're

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
dealing with emotions of guilt
and shame and fear in ways

01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:12.290 align:middle line:84%
that they never
dreamed possible.

01:03:12.290 --> 01:03:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Not by the level of story, but
by working with the raw energy

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
beings that we really
are in a masterful way.

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't get
involved in the prejudice

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of liking certain energies
and not liking other energies.

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:26.290 align:middle line:90%
You tracking?

01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So what you just
did by hugging--

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's just a tiny
little example of what

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
I want to teach you but what you
just did by squeezing that area

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
and breathing it up and
down the central channel

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is you started to create through
the chaos a pathway of flow

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.650 align:middle line:84%
through the electromagnetic
energy field.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happens then
is photon density,

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and then what happens
is electron influence,

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and what happens then is
mass begins to be amassed,

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and as that occurs,
the subconscious

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
picks up on a sense of
soul a sense of self

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
deep inside your
core, which allows

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
you to stay in an
unwavering fashion

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.080 align:middle line:84%
when somebody approaches
you in their own wobble

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.580 align:middle line:90%
with their own stuff.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't get in your wobble
because of someone else's.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
You become the absolute
unifying presence

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.425 align:middle line:84%
on the planet that
allows this machine--

01:04:16.425 --> 01:04:17.225 align:middle line:90%
get this.

01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
This is actually a
transmuting machine.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you can look at this image
and imagine that this is you,

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
this is the real you, you've
projected your consciousness

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
into the third dimension.

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And this-- the way
that it happens

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
when it becomes so
dense, that it drops

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
into this heavy world
called the third dimension,

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:41.340 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a stream of energy
that hits and rises up again.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And this whole momentum of
the toric field flow, this

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:46.460 align:middle line:90%
is moving constantly.

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
It's rolling out
constantly, unfolding.

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a transmuting machine.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what you are.

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:54.290 align:middle line:90%
You are a transmuting machine.

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
But because we
don't have awareness

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that that's who we
are, we think we're

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:00.610 align:middle line:90%
in reaction to the outer world.

01:05:00.610 --> 01:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So we don't even use
the equipment the way

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:04.820 align:middle line:84%
that it was built to be used,
you follow what I'm saying?

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.830 align:middle line:84%
You're here to turn
it up, to chew it up,

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
to turn it into something
more beautiful than how

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.500 align:middle line:90%
you found it.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.433 align:middle line:84%
My mother's saying was, leave
it better than you found it, OK?

01:05:13.433 --> 01:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
Leave it better
than you found it.

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:16.558 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're here to do.

01:05:16.558 --> 01:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
We're here to bring the
light into the density

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:19.730 align:middle line:90%
of the third dimension.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And you are seated
in a vehicle that

01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:26.030 align:middle line:84%
was designed to do it
for you, to do it as you,

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.410 align:middle line:90%
to collaborate with you.

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But we think it's
all about the mind

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and all about the
nervous system and all

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.503 align:middle line:84%
about these ancillary
systems-- and they're huge

01:05:33.503 --> 01:05:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're important,
but there is a frontier

01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that quantum science is pointing
us to, begging us to enter,

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
causing us to update
even our spirituality.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we are not
separate from God.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
We are the God stuff coming
into the third dimension

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to transmute it and bring it to
a higher vibrational frequency.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:52.430 align:middle line:90%
And the key, my folks, is love.

01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you grab and
squeeze and hug these areas

01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and breathe them up and down
the central channel, please

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
do it in the spirit of
love, because that's

01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.340 align:middle line:90%
your true nature.

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.200 align:middle line:84%
And everything else
is just mechanistic.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything else
is just a vehicle.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.270 align:middle line:84%
It is through light
and love that you

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
transmute these
frequencies into something

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.290 align:middle line:90%
that can truly make change.

01:06:13.290 --> 01:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So we have to find ways
to gather and to support

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
each other in learning how
to use the equipment that we

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:21.920 align:middle line:90%
are made of.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And as we do, we start to
embody unity consciousness.

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
the future is now.

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:33.110 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
what's next or what's

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:35.380 align:middle line:84%
going to happen on
the next horizon

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.520 align:middle line:90%
is happening in this now moment.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea of time and
space is only an illusion.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
It is only something that
this splatted, dispersed mind

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.490 align:middle line:90%
field can perceive.

01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Because in time, we will get
what I'm saying either way.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Before you leave
this life experience,

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
you will awaken to
what I'm talking about.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:56.825 align:middle line:90%
This is how you go.

01:06:56.825 --> 01:06:58.700 align:middle line:84%
There's not a doubt in
my mind of what you're

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.230 align:middle line:90%
going to see when you do.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:03.470 align:middle line:90%
And the invitation is, why wait?

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:04.460 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to wait.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
We're here to--
that's why we came.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not to catch
it on the way out.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We came to remember
and live as this this.

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Is the key.

01:07:13.770 --> 01:07:15.020 align:middle line:90%
We have to learn how to do it.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
First things first are
techniques and tools

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.860 align:middle line:90%
that make it possible.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.030 align:middle line:90%
Not just a theory.

01:07:20.030 --> 01:07:21.560 align:middle line:90%
This is about embodiment.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment came
as a gift to me.

01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
My work became about
embodiment, how

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to embody that
which I awaken to.

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've devoted my
life to doing that.

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I get on an airplane and
go somewhere in the world

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
every week and teach
this and work with people

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:39.560 align:middle line:84%
and show them the details,
the nuances of how

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.360 align:middle line:84%
this is important,
how to do it, and what

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.820 align:middle line:84%
can happen in their lives
as a byproduct of that,

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
living as the creators that
we are truly meant to be.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's a quantum world that
is allowing us to recognize.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Folks, we are it.

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:54.050 align:middle line:90%
We are the creators.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.200 align:middle line:90%
We are it.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We are here bringing
that creative essence

01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.480 align:middle line:90%
to the third dimension.

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
We are compressing ourselves
into this dimension

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.110 align:middle line:90%
for a purpose.

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You are what you've
been looking for.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:06.950 align:middle line:90%
It's behind the eyes.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the one that the
third eye can perceive.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to create
a stabilized system enough

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:16.040 align:middle line:84%
that we can allow
that third eye to open

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
without it being destructive
or disruptive to our lives.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.529 align:middle line:84%
As the people who are
having their third eye

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
open by an external
means oftentimes

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.920 align:middle line:90%
are not stabilized here.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.399 align:middle line:84%
And so it opens and
they have a bad ride,

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:38.029 align:middle line:84%
or they get depressed afterward
because they want to go back,

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and so then they become
addicted to the thing that

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.609 align:middle line:84%
gets them in the neighborhood
of what I'm speaking about.

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not speaking
negatively about those things.

01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
By all means, do whatever
you feel called to do.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But when I have helped people
in the processes of doing

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
some of those external--

01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
externally-oriented
modalities, they

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.830 align:middle line:84%
are divinely
appreciating the fact

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
that they can integrate the
experiences that they're

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.170 align:middle line:90%
having.

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:06.649 align:middle line:84%
So the work that I'm
teaching, "The Energy Codes,"

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:10.819 align:middle line:84%
it facilitates and assists
any other healing modality

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:11.689 align:middle line:90%
that exists.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.670 align:middle line:84%
From-- full spectrum,
all of them if you

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:16.090 align:middle line:84%
learn to come into
your core and breathe

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:17.450 align:middle line:90%
in this central channel.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
So this Mula Bandha, the root
lock and squeezing the heart.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.779 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
that I'd like you to do

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
is just roll your eyes
up and feel this tension

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:27.620 align:middle line:90%
behind your eyes.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath
in from overhead

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and breathe right through that
tension behind your eyes, right

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.513 align:middle line:90%
through your throat.

01:09:34.513 --> 01:09:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you
squeeze your throat,

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.720 align:middle line:84%
like Ujjayi breathing so
you can feel that vibration.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.569 align:middle line:84%
And then squeeze your heart,
and then squeeze this root lock

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
at the base of the pelvic bowl,
and then exhale into the Earth.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.097 align:middle line:84%
And then take an inhale up from
the Earth into your belly--

01:09:48.097 --> 01:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
always barely breathing,
always through the nose--

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale up through
the central channel

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and at the top of your head
because when you do this,

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you start to create
this photon density.

01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:58.550 align:middle line:90%
So how often to do this?

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Never not.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Always take a breath
from beyond your body

01:10:01.370 --> 01:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
through your body to beyond
your body when you exhale,

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.850 align:middle line:84%
because when you do, you
start to animate and activate

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and validate the fact that
you are also a subtle self.

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:13.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's
who you are first.

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.170 align:middle line:90%
You are actually this.

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And you've created this as

physical dimension.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
Capeesh?

01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:25.740 align:middle line:84%

Awesome.
