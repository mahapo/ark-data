00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.275 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy I'm not
in front of the podium.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there it is.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.590 align:middle line:90%
So, thank you for coming.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm really happy
to see everybody.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And I hope you can hear me OK.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that
I want to cover today,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.215 align:middle line:90%
and we only have so much time.

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to talk
for a little bit.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.758 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to clear everybody,

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and then we're going to ground.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.940 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go
into meditation.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go into our animal totem,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.470 align:middle line:84%
and discover what that is, and
discover how those parts of you

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:90%
are helping you.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
matter where you are,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.150 align:middle line:84%
or what you're doing in life,
or what you do for a living,

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:90%
we all need help, right?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just sort of
recap a couple things for you.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:90%
I am considered a mystic healer.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm also considered
an energy surgeon.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I work on people
all over the world.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
I defy time and space--

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
we can discuss that later--

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.040 align:middle line:84%
where I actually go in and
work on people's hearts,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.300 align:middle line:84%
and livers, and spleens,
kidneys, intestines.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.490 align:middle line:90%
I've worked on it.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And I don't need to be in front
of the person to do this work.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So I go in as if,
let's say, you guys

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
are all sitting in Singapore.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:90%
I am in my home in Arizona.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And I, literally, am able to
put myself in front of you

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.365 align:middle line:84%
and do the work that
needs to be done.

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:84%
A really good example
is a client of mine

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
here in LA had to go to
the hospital, a 911 call.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And he thought he was
having a heart attack.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.750 align:middle line:84%
He had had tests done earlier
in the week that showed he

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.030 align:middle line:90%
had blockage in various things.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So I had a session with him
scheduled for the next day,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
ironically.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And his wife called and
said, please, work on him.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.630 align:middle line:84%
He's going into
surgery in two hours.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
So I worked on him.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Arizona.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:90%
He's in Los Angeles.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
And I cleared out his arteries.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.940 align:middle line:84%
I repaired a couple
of the valves.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:90%
I put in stents.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I basically did
surgery on his heart.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
They took him into
surgery two hours later.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor came
back out and said,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
there was nothing
that we needed to do.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.440 align:middle line:90%
Your heart was fine.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the kind
of thing that happens.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I love that this takes
place when it's right.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I always work in
alignment with the will

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of God for the highest
good of everyone

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and the highest good
of the universe.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.340 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
important that when

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
healing work takes place--

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and there will be a healing
today for all of you--

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:84%
when this healing takes
place that we're not

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.880 align:middle line:84%
attached to what could happen,
but we're simply present,

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're available
to receive that.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Because on top of all this
stuff that I'm talking about,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400 align:middle line:90%
we have karma.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
We have layers and
layers of karma.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:90%
We have emotional wounds.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We have the emotional
body, the spiritual body,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
the physical body,
the mental body.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So all this stuff is what we're
contending with while we're

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%
trying to get healed, right?

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes things
happen like-- bam.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And other times, it takes
time because there is always

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
an emotional wound at the
base of whatever that disease

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
or illness or pain is.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.459 align:middle line:90%
There always is.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a lot of times, our
physical pain and problems

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:90%
with our body is karmic.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We actually experienced
that in a past life,

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:90%
only we died from it back then.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
This time we haven't.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit less,
maybe a little bit modified.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.960 align:middle line:10%
So we have to get to the root
of what's really going on.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:10%
And working with
your animal totem,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:10%
you're going to be able to
have this great inner discovery

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:10%
of what's going on in your body.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.420 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
also share with you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
that when we're
getting information,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
sometimes our systems
get a little bit clogged

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
because maybe you guys have
been listening to other events

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
prior, or you're already
kind of inundated.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you didn't
have enough coffee.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage you right now
just to pull on your ears.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.240 align:middle line:90%
Pull on your ears.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.141 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.129 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Ah, now you hear me.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And let's hit the top
of the kidney meridian

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
in your belly button,
right under the clavicle.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It should be a finger span.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Just get a nice--

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.990 align:middle line:84%
it should be painful,
actually, tender in there.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's where
you want to rub.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.177 align:middle line:90%
And rub your belly button.

00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:50.977 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:84%
We're getting
everything turned on.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.230 align:middle line:84%
Thumb right in
between your eyes.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:90%
Thumb in the belly button.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to hook up the
upper body to the lower body.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Donna Eden would be proud of me.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Finger in the belly button
and on your tailbone,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:90%
and just hold those points.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.648 align:middle line:84%
This is hooking up the lower
body to the upper body.

00:06:18.648 --> 00:06:19.448 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:06:19.448 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:84%
You look so much like Glenn
Close, it's like amazing.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Or she looks like you.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, voila.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:90%
You are here now.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Uh-oh, I'm hearing chimes.

[PHONE CHIMING]

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So a couple of things before we
get into the depth of it all.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:90%
My recent and most--

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.450 align:middle line:84%
well, it's my most recent
published book, which came out

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
just September of
last year, it's

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.350 align:middle line:84%
called "Dancing with
Raven and Bear--

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
A Book of Earth Medicine
and Animal Magic."

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And this is a lot of the
inspiration for this workshop

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I will be doing a book
signing later today at 4:15

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.685 align:middle line:90%
at the book-signing table.

00:07:21.685 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Hm, where is that?

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:90%
It's on this level, that way.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
For you at home, that
really made sense.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the wonderful
thing about this book

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.350 align:middle line:84%
is that, day in and day out,
I'm on the phone with clients.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I start at 9:00 in the morning.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't get done, a lot
of times, until 9:00 at night.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm booked out usually
six months ahead of time.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And I am talking to
people all over the world.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, when
there is an emotional pain

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:02.170 align:middle line:84%
or issue in the body,
there is also resistance.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
So I might hear from
a client, no, no.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't agree with that.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.402 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:11.402 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:90%
OK, I call that resistance.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And I usually smile
and go, OK, there's

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:90%
a little resistance there.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that we get
to our stuff in a way that

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:90%
is comfortable for us.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not one of these people
that wants to, you know,

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
bean over the head and
say, ah, it's this.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I want you to discover
it because it's important

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that it's yours, that
it belongs to you.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.850 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So this book was written
with all my clients in mind.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote in my
Native heritage

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:90%
language of storytelling.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's stories
about Bear and Raven.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Bear is a medicine man.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Raven is his sidekick.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.860 align:middle line:90%
He's a trickster.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But he helps Bear, and
we learn from Raven.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of these stories
are about the things

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:84%
that we deal with on a
day-to-day basis There

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
are stories about love, about
grounding, about releasing

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
pain, power dreaming, death,
the illusion, a safe place,

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
the medicine path, the
next seven generations.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.032 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is a really--

00:09:36.032 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
it's a really beautiful book.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Because in these
stories, there is

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:90%
an altering of time and space.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
when you read these stories,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
you might feel that you're sort
of transported somewhere else.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I hope for you.

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I hope you guys all get
this book because it's

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
really important to me that we
have a way, a doorway, to get

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in and to be able to hear
what that message is even

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:90%
through our resistance.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.080 align:middle line:10%
So if you close
your eyes right now,

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.980 align:middle line:10%
tell me where you feel any kind
of resistance in your body,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:10%
like it's tight.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:90%
That's resistance.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It's holding.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:90%
That's resistance.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Just say it out loud
all at the same time.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.595 align:middle line:90%
Where is it?

00:10:35.595 --> 00:10:36.990 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIENCE CHATTER]

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Ah, good job.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:90%
I heard, "I don't know."

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.402 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

00:10:44.402 --> 00:10:48.012 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now tell
me, just out loud,

00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I want everybody
to tell me, what's

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:90%
your right foot feel like?

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.376 align:middle line:90%
[WRONG ANSWER SOUND]

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.306 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, try again.

00:11:00.704 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.132 align:middle line:90%
Tingling.

00:11:04.132 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Normal.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.700 align:middle line:90%
Normal isn't a word.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So here's the point
I want to make.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you at home,
you can try this as well.

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
When we take the time every
day to go through our body

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.060 align:middle line:90%
and check in--

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:90%
close your eyes.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
What does the right
foot feel like?

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
For me, it feels kind of hard,
like it's not real mobile

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.540 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I switch
to the left foot.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the left foot feels
kind of tingly and prickly

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:90%
like I've been sitting on it.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Then I go up to my right calf.

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Huh, my right calf feels
kind of empty and hollow.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And my left calf feels really
tight and has a lot of tension.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And we keep moving
up through our body--

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
right knee, left
knee, right thigh,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
left thigh, hip, hip, waist,
waist, shoulder, shoulder,

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
arms, head, right
side, left side.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the best ways
you can hone your sensitivity.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not kidding.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.100 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely--
if you want to be

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.130 align:middle line:84%
more attuned to
your sensitivity,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.480 align:middle line:84%
your empathic nature,
this is the way to do it.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:90%
But you can't slide on it.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't go, right
foot, yeah, feels good.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:90%
Left foot-- eh, normal.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Right leg-- uh.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
get in there and feel.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Feeling is something
that is underrated.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like we all
feel, but then we

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
all spend a great deal of
time avoiding them or numbing

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:90%
ourselves from them.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And when we're born, our
species, the human species,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
unlike a lot of
alien species, were

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
handed a palette, this
big palette with feelings,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:90%
like paints.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And every day, we take our
paint brush, and we dip it in,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.820 align:middle line:90%
and we say, oh, I feel happy.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I feel a little resentment
and a little anger down here.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And we have frustration.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:90%
OK, there is my day.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:29.000 align:middle line:84%
We do that every day
because we have feelings.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's so many
experiences people have

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
had of being abducted or having
some encounter with an ET,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and they're going, wow,
there was no emotion.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.640 align:middle line:90%
There was no-- nothing.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.490 align:middle line:84%
That's because they
don't have that.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So those feelings
are the vehicle.

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
They're the very-- car.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.910 align:middle line:84%
They're the car that we
drive throughout our lives.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Those feelings are directly
connected to your karma.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So all of the things that
you've been through karmically

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.090 align:middle line:90%
are unresolved emotional wounds.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And those unresolved
emotional wounds

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:19.840 align:middle line:84%
match up with your unresolved
emotional wounds of today.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the thread
that connects us.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So when you do this
exercise on your own,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
really take the time to feel,
and allow yourself to feel

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:90%
what your body's feeling.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Because God knows, when
we're out there in the world,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
we're not really given
a whole lot of space

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:90%
to have our feelings, right?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
You're at work, right?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK, we're in our cars.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.830 align:middle line:90%
Ah.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
We're expressing it in our cars.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.160 align:middle line:90%
But try.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Try this exercise because
it's really good to attune you

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.110 align:middle line:90%
to what you need to be feeling.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:03.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going to do
the grounding meditation.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk
you through this,

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to explain a couple
things before I get started.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I teach a grounding meditation.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Actually, that's in my book,
"Dancing with Raven and Bear."

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating
cones of energy.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.420 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stand
up for just a minute.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.420 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:90%
No OK.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.332 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:39.332 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:90%
How about now?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> How about now?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.830 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine putting
on a skirt, really low--

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:90%
yes, even you guys--

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:84%
low on your hips, really
low, and the skirt

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
flares, and it goes
all the way down

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.770 align:middle line:84%
to the center of the
earth like a cone, that's

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:90%
what you're going to do.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
All the way around
your first chakra

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
here, you're going to create a
cone of energy that goes down

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the earth.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And then from the belly,
you'll do the same thing.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
You'll put on another
skirt, or cone,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
and you'll create that cone
over the first cone, and then

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.360 align:middle line:84%
the third right
here over that cone.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:90%
So they're like stackables.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:90%
It's very cool.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And then in the heart,
we create a cone that

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
goes inside the
first three cones,

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and the fifth inside that,
the sixth inside that,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:90%
and the seventh inside that.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
If you're an engineer,
please don't get

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
hung up on how far it is
to the center of the earth.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
you through this,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
go into meditation.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we get there, then
I'm going to clear you guys.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And then we'll go
into the animal totem.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:10%
By any chance, did you guys--

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:10%
do you have paper and pen?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:10%
Or did you guys bring
anything to write on?

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You might want to have that
out so that as we go through

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the totem, you can write down
whatever you're getting and not

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:90%
forget who or what was where.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you at home,
get your pen and paper out.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.886 align:middle line:90%
Hi, Mom.

00:17:40.886 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.960 align:middle line:90%
My mother's in Guam right now.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge typhoon that's
actually gone past Guam,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.140 align:middle line:84%
but they're hoping it doesn't
turn around and clobber

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:90%
them coming back.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.532 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I've been
[BLOWING] all day

00:17:59.532 --> 00:18:02.360 align:middle line:84%
trying to get it to
go the other way.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going
to close our eyes.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do this with
you and talk you through it.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Try to get your breathing
a little bit slowed down.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.140 align:middle line:84%
I always like to use a yogic
breath where you breathe in

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
through the nose, and you
exhale through the nose

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.740 align:middle line:90%
with a much longer exhale.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.915 align:middle line:84%
Just slow your breathing
down for a moment.

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And drop your consciousness
down into your first chakra.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And at your first chakra,
create a cone of energy

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.820 align:middle line:84%
that goes all the way
down, deeper and deeper,

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
further and further,
all the way down

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the earth.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It can be clear.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:90%
It can be any color.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But do not send your
chakras anywhere.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.155 align:middle line:90%
Only create a cone of energy.

00:19:15.155 --> 00:19:22.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.605 align:middle line:90%
Now go into the second chakra.

00:19:23.605 --> 00:19:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Create a second cone of energy
that goes over the first cone

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the earth.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And go into your third chakra.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.655 align:middle line:84%
Let your third chakra be
calm, like a clear, calm lake.

00:20:01.655 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And create a third
cone of energy

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
that goes over the
first two cones,

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:20.570 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the earth.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.725 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:20:22.725 --> 00:20:30.065 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And feel those first
three chakras grounded.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Feel what that feels like.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:45.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
Now go into your heart.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Let your heart be like a
three-dimensional sun with rays

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of love shining out towards
others and rays of love

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.615 align:middle line:90%
shining in towards yourself.

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Create a fourth
cone of energy that

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:84%
goes inside the
first three cones,

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the earth.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.765 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:21:23.765 --> 00:21:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:90%
And go into your fifth chakra.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Create a fifth
cone of energy that

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.920 align:middle line:84%
goes inside the heart cone,
all the way down, deeper

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and deeper, further and
further, all the way down

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.010 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the earth.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And go into your sixth chakra.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.760 align:middle line:10%
Let your mind be clear, as if
you're looking at a blank movie

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.510 align:middle line:10%
screen.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Create a sixth
cone of energy that

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.230 align:middle line:84%
goes inside the fifth
cone, all the way down

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:20.140 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the earth.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And go into your seventh chakra.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:84%
The top of your
head, let it open up

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:90%
like a flower blossoming open.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And create a seventh
cone of energy

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:84%
that goes inside
the other cones,

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:84%
all the way down, deeper and
deeper, further and further,

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:53.410 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to the
center of the earth.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And ground it with
a very large base.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
We're now connecting
with our higher selves

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and with God and the Goddess.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.590 align:middle line:84%
We're asking for
the violet flame

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to transmute any negative
energy, any negative thought

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:84%
forms from our bodies, our
auric fields, and this room.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that
energy coming in.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking
for the white light

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to descend and saturate
every cell in every molecule

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, and our
auric fields, and this room,

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:84%
the golden light of divine
love, and the blue light

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:90%
of protection.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.840 align:middle line:84%
I want you to drop down
into the hara, which

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.670 align:middle line:90%
is right in your belly.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little bit
above the second chakra.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It's like an egg shape in there.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's small, but you may
have to envision yourself

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
repelling into the hara,
maybe taking a ladder down

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:90%
into the hara--

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.530 align:middle line:84%
however you want to
get into the hara.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Let your consciousness
go deep into your belly

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:40.350 align:middle line:90%
into that space.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And just stay there
and feel that energy

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.610 align:middle line:84%
while I clear
everyone in the room.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:25:46.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to drop
your consciousness down

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.945 align:middle line:84%
into your first chakra
where you're sitting.

00:25:52.945 --> 00:25:56.134 align:middle line:90%


00:25:56.134 --> 00:25:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And let your consciousness
go all the way

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
into that first chakra.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
look around and ask

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:84%
for the animal that lives
in your first chakra

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.990 align:middle line:90%
to show itself.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:28.380 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Once this animal
reveals itself to you,

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I want you to put food
and water down to feed it.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:47.510 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to ask this
animal, how do you feel?

00:26:51.520 --> 00:27:03.400 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And then ask the animal,
what do you need?

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Give the animal whatever
it is that they need.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:22.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Those of you with
pen and paper, you

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.960 align:middle line:84%
might want to jot a few
notes down before we move on.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Stay in your meditation, and
move into your second chakra.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to tell
that first chakra animal

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that you will see them
again and that you're

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:90%
grateful that they came out.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.734 align:middle line:90%


00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:37.845 align:middle line:84%
And move into your second
chakra now, your belly.

00:28:37.845 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to ask
what animal is there

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and to have it come out
and show itself to you.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you see that animal,
be sure and put food and water

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:90%
down, and feed it.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.035 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to ask this
animal, how do you feel?

00:29:25.035 --> 00:29:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And what do you need?

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and give them
whatever it is that they need,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.600 align:middle line:84%
and take notes if
you have paper.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Now going up into
the third chakra,

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:84%
right there in
your solar plexus,

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
let your consciousness drop
down into your solar plex area,

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.310 align:middle line:84%
and ask for that
animal to show itself.

00:30:46.310 --> 00:31:02.060 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.830 align:middle line:84%
Once you see that
animal, be sure

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and give it food and water, and
thank it for coming to see you.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Ask it how it feels,
and what does it need?

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and give
them what they need.

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:47.557 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.557 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And if it's 500,000 acres
in Africa, you can do it.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:32:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Now go into your fourth chakra,
and look around in your heart.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Ask for the animal that lives
in your heart to come out,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.270 align:middle line:90%
show itself to you.

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and put some food
and water down for them.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And ask that animal,
how do you feel?

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:56.020 align:middle line:90%


00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:57.010 align:middle line:90%
And what do you need?

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:10.210 align:middle line:90%


00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and give
them what they need,

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and then thank them for coming
out and showing themselves

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.390 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:35.610 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to move up into
the fifth chakra, your throat.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I want you to look
around inside your throat

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and see what animal
shows itself to you.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:59.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Put some food and water down.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.219 align:middle line:90%
And ask them, how do you feel?

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
And then ask them,
what do you need?

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:49.230 align:middle line:90%


00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Once you've given them
what they need, thank them.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And we'll move up into the
sixth chakra, your mind.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Look around inside
your sixth chakra,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and ask that the
animal that lives there

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
comes out and shows
itself to you.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Put some food and water
down for that animal.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:46.010 align:middle line:90%
And ask them, how do you feel?

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:56.860 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And then ask them,
what do you need?

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:19.250 align:middle line:90%


00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you give
them what they need,

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and thank them for coming out
and showing themselves to you.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:32.770 align:middle line:90%


00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to move up
into the seventh chakra,

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.820 align:middle line:90%
the top of your head.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
use your inner eyes,

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.930 align:middle line:84%
and look up in the
seventh chakra,

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.440 align:middle line:84%
and see what animal is
sitting on top of your head.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and put food
and water down for them.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.620 align:middle line:90%


00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And ask them, how do you feel?

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:22.830 align:middle line:90%


00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Then ask them, what do you need?

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Be sure and give
them what they need.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And thank them for coming and
showing themselves to you.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:13.405 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.405 --> 00:38:16.508 align:middle line:84%
And for just a few minutes,
we're going to open our eyes,

00:38:16.508 --> 00:38:18.175 align:middle line:84%
but we're going to
stay really grounded.

00:38:18.175 --> 00:38:22.448 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.448 --> 00:38:24.245 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
stay in this state.

00:38:24.245 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.370 align:middle line:84%
How many of you saw all
seven of your animals?

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.170 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.420 align:middle line:90%
How many of you saw just a few?

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So the big question is, where
is everybody hiding out?

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Come out.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Come out, wherever you are.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:57.240 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times when I do
processing work with people,

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'll go in and talk to
the inner female and male,

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.450 align:middle line:90%
the female side isn't there.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It's just the male side.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times what
that means for people

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.170 align:middle line:84%
is that the male side is very
dominant, even for women.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the side of us--

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.970 align:middle line:84%
how many of you women
get right-sided pain?

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Right-sided pain,
OK, what that's about

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is the male side takes
things out into the world

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.340 align:middle line:90%
and does something with it.

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The female side gathers
the information.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.170 align:middle line:90%
She hands it to the right side.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The right side takes it out
and does something with it.

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of women end
up with right-sided pain

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
because they're driving
the kids to school.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:41.830 align:middle line:90%
They're working a full-time job.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And then they're cooking
dinner for everyone.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And no, that doesn't exclude
men from the difficult tasks

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.780 align:middle line:90%
that you two have.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But for women, having
right-sided pain

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
often means a really
overworked male side.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.790 align:middle line:84%
For men who have
left-sided pain,

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.540 align:middle line:84%
it means that you're
not being heard.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
You're not being gotten.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:10.015 align:middle line:90%
You're not being perceived.

00:40:10.015 --> 00:40:13.100 align:middle line:90%
So it works in both camps.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:84%
But when an animal
is not present,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
there is some part of
you that is not yet

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.670 align:middle line:90%
connecting with that part.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.250 align:middle line:90%
And that will come about.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.670 align:middle line:84%
That animal will come out
and show itself to you.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It may take just more time and
sitting in meditation more.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will see
two animals in one area.

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask, which one
was lunch for the other animal?

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.403 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, like I have a hawk.

00:40:48.403 --> 00:40:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And there was a mouse there.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, mouse, hawk--

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.510 align:middle line:84%
oh, yeah, the mouse
was lunch for the hawk.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.780 align:middle line:90%
No offense to any mice.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
whole harmony thing, OK?

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:04.300 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
a bear in your totem?

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you have,
along with that bear or larger

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:12.760 align:middle line:84%
animal, a smaller
animal, or more

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
like a rodent or something,
a rabbit, something small?

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what we're
up against then

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to make sure
that that third chakra

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.630 align:middle line:84%
animal isn't going after the
fourth chakra animal for lunch.

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And how that translates
in human lives is

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.430 align:middle line:84%
you have a very powerful
animal in that third chakra,

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.483 align:middle line:84%
and then you have this
smaller, kind of timid animal

00:41:39.483 --> 00:41:40.900 align:middle line:84%
in the fourth
chakra that could be

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.690 align:middle line:84%
lunch for that animal
in the third chakra.

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.580 align:middle line:84%
That's all about
your power center.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:49.310 align:middle line:84%
You're really powerful, but
your heart is very tender.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.850 align:middle line:90%
It's very vulnerable.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And your heart can be
overcome, overwhelmed

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.340 align:middle line:90%
by this other energy.

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really be
careful that that third chakra

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:84%
energy isn't taking
over the heart chakra.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:12.660 align:middle line:84%
So depending on where
your animals are,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.090 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
them is important.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said, if
one of your animals

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:21.180 align:middle line:84%
needs 500,000 acres
in Africa, give it

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:84%
to them because you want to give
them as much space as possible.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:32.310 align:middle line:90%
These are a part of you.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.340 align:middle line:90%
They're a part of you.

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you see these
animals out in the wild,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.345 align:middle line:90%
it now means something.

00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:42.175 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody have a
deer in their totem?

00:42:42.175 --> 00:42:44.720 align:middle line:90%
A deer-- uh-huh, good.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you see a deer out there
in the wild, it's a message.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.860 align:middle line:90%
It is a message for you.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
hawks or eagles or--

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.170 align:middle line:84%
yeah, we've got a
lot of birds in here.

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:90%
We're all soaring together.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:00.410 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> An owl.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.680 align:middle line:84%
>> An owl, yeah, so
pay attention to that.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I have a hawk in my totem.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Man, I see a hawk
when I'm driving,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.330 align:middle line:84%
I practically
drive off the road.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, it's
a hawk, you know?

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:90%
Because to me, it's exciting.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It's how we used to live.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
We lived close to the earth back
before technology and phones.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.640 align:middle line:90%
We really did, you guys.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.950 align:middle line:90%
We could hear the earth.

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.500 align:middle line:90%
We could hear her song.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:38.380 align:middle line:84%
We understood water, and fire,
and wind, and all the elements.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We understood those
things because that's

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.350 align:middle line:90%
what we had to be content with.

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what we watched.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.780 align:middle line:84%
That's what we spent
our time observing.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why so many
of the ancient people

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.280 align:middle line:84%
were really incredible
astronomers.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.640 align:middle line:84%
What else did we have to
do but look at the sky

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and study the stars?

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:04.030 align:middle line:84%
We weren't watching
old reruns of "Cheers."

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.340 align:middle line:90%
But we were watching Gaia TV.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I can bet on that.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.490 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's important that
even though we're not

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.600 align:middle line:84%
living in those times now,
and we're very modern,

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and we all get lost in our
phones and all of technology

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:middle line:84%
that we really make
a conscious effort

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
the earth and when

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.660 align:middle line:84%
we do see our totem
animals that we're

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:34.720 align:middle line:90%
recognizing that as a message.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Notice what direction
the animal is going.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Notice if that hawk, or
osprey, or owl is sitting

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.950 align:middle line:84%
or if they're actually
flying over you.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%
All of these things
mean something.

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And we're just so darn busy.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.430 align:middle line:90%
We have to take the time.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:10%
I also feel that the
grounding meditation

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.040 align:middle line:10%
we did and sending your
energy down the cones

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:10%
is the way that I teach
people, in essence, how

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:10%
to stop creating more
karma for yourselves.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens when
we are creating karma

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:24.820 align:middle line:84%
is that we are allowing
the energy from our bodies

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to go out from us and
connect with like energies.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
boom, you just

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.970 align:middle line:84%
signed up for the
big karma train

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because you connected
with somebody else.

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:39.790 align:middle line:90%
You feel fear.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.560 align:middle line:90%
They feel fear.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:90%
It's fear.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the
collective fear.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So you're ringing all the bells
through all your lifetimes

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.840 align:middle line:84%
of that feeling fear, and you're
just keeping that big karma

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.010 align:middle line:90%
wheel going.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we ground our energy
deep into the earth and we're

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.560 align:middle line:84%
not engaging our
energy with each other,

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
with other things,
the television--

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, all my energy
just left and went

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.270 align:middle line:90%
into the television, right?

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.860 align:middle line:84%
When we ground that, then
we become the observers.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Then we're able to step back
and observe what's going on.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean
not feel things.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm the queen of feeling things.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:32.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean being able to
observe what you're feeling

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.765 align:middle line:84%
and ground those feelings
right down the cones.

00:46:34.765 --> 00:46:37.280 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, the earth
is here to help us.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.500 align:middle line:90%
This is that earth medicine.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:47.630 align:middle line:84%
The earth's energy
is here to help us.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:51.110 align:middle line:84%
The earth's energy supports
our electromagnetic field.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.100 align:middle line:90%
We already know that.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:84%
But the energy from the
earth coming up these cones

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:02.090 align:middle line:84%
into your chakras, into
your whole physical being,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.600 align:middle line:90%
is supporting you.

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And we've put a lot
of asphalt between us

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:90%
and the planet, right?

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.110 align:middle line:84%
We've really kind of
separated ourselves.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's not easy
here in Los Angeles.

00:47:16.450 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But anytime you can get
your feet on the ground,

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:25.130 align:middle line:84%
it's amazing what that will
do for your energy system.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:90%
So I encourage you to do that.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage you,
when you ground,

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:32.320 align:middle line:84%
you ground with the
cones, and you equally

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:36.870 align:middle line:84%
allow earth energy to
come up these cones.

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:41.010 align:middle line:84%
I would like to go back
now into our meditation.

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And I would like-- do you
remember when we all tuned in,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and felt where the
resistance was,

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and you guys all
said it out loud?

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:55.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back to that,
wherever that resistance was.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And then go to the
animal and the chakra

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:03.060 align:middle line:84%
that you were at, wherever
that is, and address it

00:48:03.060 --> 00:48:05.230 align:middle line:90%
with that totem animal.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.030 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
give you an example.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you have a badger
in your second chakra,

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're dealing
with back pain.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:21.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to ask for you
to drop into that back pain

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and to also connect with
the badger, all right?

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Everybody got it?

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.826 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going
to close our eyes.

00:48:30.826 --> 00:48:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Go back into your
grounded cones of energy.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Just through your
mind, let yourself

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:43.720 align:middle line:84%
go through first, second, third,
all the way up to seventh,

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.492 align:middle line:84%
just regrounding
those cones of energy.

00:48:46.492 --> 00:48:47.292 align:middle line:90%
Mhm.

00:48:47.292 --> 00:48:49.964 align:middle line:90%


00:48:49.964 --> 00:48:50.764 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:48:50.764 --> 00:48:58.700 align:middle line:90%


00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And then drop into
that place, wherever

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:05.270 align:middle line:84%
that is in your body, where
you have some pain or maybe

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.740 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
resistance, a blockage.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.210 align:middle line:90%
It's tight.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:12.010 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:14.622 align:middle line:90%


00:49:14.622 --> 00:49:17.920 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't feel good.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.948 align:middle line:90%
Go into that area.

00:49:18.948 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And then access and ask for
the animal in the chakra

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:35.269 align:middle line:84%
that that is in, that
area, to come out.

00:49:35.269 --> 00:49:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
ask that animal

00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:48.271 align:middle line:84%
in that area of your pain
to help you with that pain.

00:49:48.271 --> 00:49:58.853 align:middle line:90%


00:49:58.853 --> 00:50:07.679 align:middle line:84%
Ask them to help you to remove,
heal, and mend that pain.

00:50:07.679 --> 00:50:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you have any
excess of anything

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:44.530 align:middle line:84%
that needs to leave
your body, make

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:47.890 align:middle line:84%
sure you send it down
the cone of energy

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:50.470 align:middle line:84%
from that chakra
all the way down

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:51.766 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the earth.

00:50:51.766 --> 00:51:05.390 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And let that animal receive
food, and water, and your love

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:15.920 align:middle line:90%
when they're done.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.358 align:middle line:90%
Honor them and acknowledge them.

00:51:22.358 --> 00:51:49.748 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.748 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
ready, we're going

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.056 align:middle line:90%
to come back up to our eyes.

00:51:53.056 --> 00:52:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.860 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want you to feel your
body and see if that feels

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.232 align:middle line:90%
a little bit different now.

00:52:08.232 --> 00:52:10.736 align:middle line:90%


00:52:10.736 --> 00:52:11.536 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:52:11.536 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:90%


00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Did you guys have your animals
come and help you with that?

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:20.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:24.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.230 align:middle line:90%
Anybody, no?

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.330 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:31.443 align:middle line:84%
I was going to send
mine out to help you.

00:52:31.443 --> 00:52:32.826 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:52:32.826 --> 00:52:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:42.020 align:middle line:84%
OK, my guides want
to do a healing,

00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:50.350 align:middle line:84%
but I'm totally moved to
read you something here

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:55.360 align:middle line:84%
because I think this is quite
inspiring for all of us who

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.660 align:middle line:84%
want to meditate, maybe
do meditate, or think

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.370 align:middle line:84%
about meditating but never
quite get around to doing it.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:07.060 align:middle line:90%
This is chapter 1, "Grounding."

00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:11.170 align:middle line:84%
"There was a girl who sat in
meditation for so long her hair

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.420 align:middle line:90%
grew into a raven.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Her mind released all
that she was attached to,

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.750 align:middle line:90%
and she began to feel peaceful.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:23.500 align:middle line:84%
As she let things
go, her body relaxed,

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and the raven on her head
called out to his friends.

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.720 align:middle line:84%
They sat in her lap
and had a noisy talk.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They discussed the weather
and the latest news.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It was so loud, she felt the
noise dissolve into nothing.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.730 align:middle line:84%
She could feel her
body was no more.

00:53:42.730 --> 00:53:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The birds were
weightless in her arms.

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Her energy started
to dissolve and merge

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.850 align:middle line:84%
with the ravens and
the air around her,

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:55.480 align:middle line:90%
joining with her all that was.

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.660 align:middle line:84%
The ravens grew quiet
and whispered in her ear,

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.610 align:middle line:90%
"Be free, little one.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Allow yourself to be free.'

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.780 align:middle line:84%
She felt a deep peace
that was indescribable

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and encompassed all that she
was and all that she knew.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:18.090 align:middle line:84%
She felt wings sprout out of her
back, and had her body changed.

00:54:18.090 --> 00:54:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Feathers emerged,
and a large beak

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:23.580 align:middle line:90%
formed where her mouth was.

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.460 align:middle line:84%
She took flight
with the other birds

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:30.688 align:middle line:84%
and realized her human form
was not who she really was."

00:54:30.688 --> 00:54:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
things to reality.

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know that a lot of
us have questioned reality.

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.530 align:middle line:90%
Is that really real?

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that person really do that?

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Should I believe that?

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what I
feel or what I believe.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.210 align:middle line:84%
They said this, and
this one said that.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we have an
experience, like you

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.370 align:middle line:84%
guys just did going
into meditation

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and connecting with some or
all of your totem animals.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.760 align:middle line:90%
That's yours.

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.920 align:middle line:90%
That's your experience.

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:13.760 align:middle line:90%
And that is everything.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.707 align:middle line:90%
That's what matters.

00:55:14.707 --> 00:55:17.510 align:middle line:90%


00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:19.070 align:middle line:90%
We can read.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:20.790 align:middle line:90%
We can learn.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.240 align:middle line:84%
We can gather all
this information,

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.730 align:middle line:90%
and we can still be confused.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But what really matters
is what you feel.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And being able to
get at what you feel

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:41.540 align:middle line:84%
means being able to move some
of this stuff out of the way.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.790 align:middle line:84%
In order for me to
be the healer that I

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:47.150 align:middle line:84%
am, 38 years of
doing this work, I

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.510 align:middle line:84%
have to keep my
filters really clear.

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I cannot indulge in anything
in order to do this work.

00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And I take a lot of care
so that I can be in service

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.960 align:middle line:90%
and do this work.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect other people
to live the way that I live.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But for me, this is what I have
to do to honor these gifts.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.780 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
information out there.

00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.460 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot, you guys.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.550 align:middle line:90%
And it is confusing.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And I hear about it
every day, all day long.

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, this person told me this,
and now this is happening.

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I went here and did
this, and blah-- you

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.060 align:middle line:90%
know, I mean, I hear it all.

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.770 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sorry.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it breaks my heart.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:48.030 align:middle line:84%
It really does because I work
so hard to be as genuine and as

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:51.070 align:middle line:90%
integritous as I can.

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And in this industry,
you know, it's

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:57.190 align:middle line:84%
kind of like climbing
Mount Everest sometimes.

00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:58.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:02.620 align:middle line:90%
And my job isn't easy.

00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.370 align:middle line:84%
There's things that I
encounter and that I

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:09.410 align:middle line:84%
do, clearing entities, clearing
aliens, taking implants out

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.470 align:middle line:84%
of people, all this stuff
that I do in my work

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:16.160 align:middle line:90%
that I wouldn't wish on anyone.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But what we all share
is a spiritual path.

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:24.740 align:middle line:84%
We all share this
unity of connectivity.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:90%
And what connects us--

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.760 align:middle line:90%
that saying, we are all one.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:33.110 align:middle line:84%
What connects us is our
emotions, our feelings.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I feel love.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.310 align:middle line:90%
You feel love.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I feel pain.

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.100 align:middle line:90%
You feel pain.

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I feel sadness.

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.980 align:middle line:90%
You feel sadness.

00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:41.000 align:middle line:90%
We share that.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.850 align:middle line:90%
That's how we all connect.

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's so
important for us

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to have our emotional
palette clear,

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that I am painting my
world with a lot of joy.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to paint my
world with a lot of resentment

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:06.120 align:middle line:84%
because that usually
causes problems in my body.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.190 align:middle line:90%
We can't deny what we feel.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But we can process those
feelings and release them.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And now you have the gift,
the tool of the cones.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel you've got a
lot of resentment building up--

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:23.520 align:middle line:90%
let's say it's in your heart.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You just flush that right
down that fourth chakra cone

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.180 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the earth.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:31.280 align:middle line:90%
She can take it.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:35.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why she's there for
us, is for us to energetically

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.030 align:middle line:90%
release into her.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:41.510 align:middle line:90%
She will give us back energy--

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:43.530 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:46.335 align:middle line:84%
And another thing,
while I'm on a roll--

00:58:46.335 --> 00:58:47.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:49.900 align:middle line:90%


00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do this job
without a sense of humor.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.350 align:middle line:90%
I love to laugh--

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:55.740 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you find yourself
getting too serious, call me.

00:58:58.850 --> 00:59:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Because really, we
need to laugh more.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of talk about
3D, 4D, 5D consciousness.

00:59:06.740 --> 00:59:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And I want to explain this
to you guys in relationship

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to what you just did and
understanding how this works.

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:19.130 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
Mayan calendar,

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:22.740 align:middle line:84%
we moved out of the
fourth dimension.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:30.240 align:middle line:84%
As the human species, we've only
been here for 20 million years.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:34.960 align:middle line:84%
The earth is 4.5
billion years old.

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we break it
down to five dimensions

00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:43.785 align:middle line:84%
that the earth has
been in, that is--

00:59:43.785 --> 00:59:45.340 align:middle line:90%
if I can remember my math--

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:51.090 align:middle line:90%
900 million years per dimension.

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:54.050 align:middle line:84%
We haven't even
been here that long.

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:58.160 align:middle line:84%
We dropped in in the middle
of the fourth dimension.

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:03.020 align:middle line:84%
The fourth dimension
was all about love.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.800 align:middle line:90%
We fought wars for love.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We had William
Shakespeare, for god sakes.

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:11.420 align:middle line:90%
We had the Beatles.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.945 align:middle line:84%
We had so many cool things
that were expressing love.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.630 align:middle line:90%


01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the end of
the Mayan calendar,

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.190 align:middle line:84%
we moved into the
fifth dimension.

01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:25.010 align:middle line:90%
This is a whole new ball game.

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.750 align:middle line:90%
We have never been here before.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
This is us as a species going,
whoa, things are moving faster.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.910 align:middle line:90%
The energy is more intense.

01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:36.740 align:middle line:90%
I have weird neck pain.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And why do I have ringing
in my ears forever?

01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this fifth
dimension, all of us

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.900 align:middle line:90%
together, going, I don't know.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And this is what's happening.

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:52.300 align:middle line:90%
It's moving really fast.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Time and space is
moving quickly.

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And we're trying to keep up.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't keep
our energy level

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
high by meditating,
doing yoga, watching

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.440 align:middle line:84%
our favorite movie, "Pride
and Prejudice," if we don't

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.640 align:middle line:84%
do all these things that really
make us happy and excited

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.660 align:middle line:84%
for life, then our energy
is at a lower vibration

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
than the energy that
we're living in.

01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So this fifth dimensional
energy requires us to step up.

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to step up if
we're going to do this.

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so in understanding
3D, 4D, 5D,

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
there are another
aspect to energy

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
that we must have
an understanding of,

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and that is the realms.

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
The realms are the
consciousness that we're in.

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So imagine our whole
galaxy is floating

01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:55.690 align:middle line:90%
in the fifth dimension, OK?

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And then in each one
of us, because there

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.450 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible grid system
set up, there is realms.

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
The earth is naturally in
the second realm, which

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.520 align:middle line:90%
is turbulent and violent--

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
earthquakes, volcanic
eruptions, waves, storms.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.880 align:middle line:90%
It's disruptive.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Humans have been in the
second realm for a good part

01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
of our time here on Earth.

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
We've recently moved into
the third realm, which

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is a little bit more
like, let's work it out.

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:31.640 align:middle line:90%
I won't kill you today.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.790 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it, you know?

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Second realm was more like,
yeah, I'm going to kill you.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.770 align:middle line:90%
Because we warred a lot.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:42.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's not forget our
history, you guys.

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
We've been a very violent
species up until now.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Thank god, we're
more peaceful now.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But we have these realms
that we move in and out of.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.510 align:middle line:84%
The fourth realm is
a much higher realm.

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we are
aiming for as spiritual people.

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama, naturally,
is in the fourth realm.

01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of high
spiritual teachers,

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of spiritual
people have obtained

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and maintain the fourth realm.

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
The fifth realm
is more of a place

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:21.440 align:middle line:90%
where alien consciousness is.

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
The sixth realm is more
of where the angels are.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's these
different kinds of realms.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way I describe
it is the dimensions

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
are these horizontal
lines, and the realms

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.430 align:middle line:90%
are the vertical lines.

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And the realms shift
back and forth.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the trick to
the fifth dimension--

01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:46.220 align:middle line:84%
this is the soup we're
swimming in now--

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
is it's such a high
frequency, portals actually

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:56.100 align:middle line:84%
are opening up with
other dimensions in them.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And these portals
that are opening up

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:03.020 align:middle line:84%
are bringing through
alien life to Earth.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
activity now on Earth

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
because we're in
the fifth dimension.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And they now have access to
coming through these portals,

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:15.140 align:middle line:90%
which are other dimensions.

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.825 align:middle line:84%
Aliens live naturally
in the sixth

01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:21.110 align:middle line:90%
or the seventh dimensions.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So this is important.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to explain this to
you guys so you understand.

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a matter of
having 3D consciousness.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.660 align:middle line:84%
It's understanding the
realms are the consciousness.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.330 align:middle line:90%
The dimension is what we're in.

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the soup we swim in, OK?

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go
back into meditation.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have my
guides shift the energy so you

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:49.500 align:middle line:90%
can feel the different realms.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is, remember
your exercise-- right foot,

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
left foot, right
knee, left knee.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you've got to really
be in your feeling mode

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.780 align:middle line:90%
to feel this, OK?

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:01.315 align:middle line:90%
So stay very grounded, please.

01:05:01.315 --> 01:05:04.050 align:middle line:90%


01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, deep breath, yeah.

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%


01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So again, in your mind,
just go through the chakras,

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.425 align:middle line:90%
grounding them.

01:05:18.425 --> 01:05:19.225 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:19.225 --> 01:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%


01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:38.255 align:middle line:84%
So right now, we're all
sitting in the third realm.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And my guides are
going to shift it

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
so we move into the fourth realm
so you can feel that energy.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:47.790 align:middle line:90%
Stay really grounded.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.942 align:middle line:84%
You guys will feel
this at home as well.

01:05:49.942 --> 01:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%


01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:08.980 align:middle line:84%
You might feel your heart
rate go up a little bit.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:12.584 align:middle line:84%
You might feel kind of
a pressure in your body.

01:06:12.584 --> 01:06:28.985 align:middle line:90%


01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.445 align:middle line:84%
OK, now they're moving
us into the fifth realm.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:40.860 align:middle line:90%


01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So being in the fifth realm
in the fifth dimension

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:47.542 align:middle line:84%
creates a completely
different kind of opening.

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:52.900 align:middle line:90%


01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you let your eyes kind of
roll up to the top of your head

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and look up, you can
see that opening.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%


01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.660 align:middle line:90%
OK, nobody leave your body.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.142 align:middle line:90%
We're not going anywhere.

01:07:13.142 --> 01:07:30.520 align:middle line:90%


01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
OK, and they're
moving us back now--

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.312 align:middle line:90%
fourth and third.

01:07:36.312 --> 01:07:51.252 align:middle line:90%


01:07:51.252 --> 01:07:53.742 align:middle line:90%
OK, and opening up your eyes.

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%


01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Who felt what?

01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:01.360 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt a pressure.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:02.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Pressure.

01:08:02.970 --> 01:08:04.428 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] was
a nice pressure.

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.450 align:middle line:90%
(SINGING) Under pressure.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:09.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, who else?

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:10.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:12.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt more alert.

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Alert, good.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sensitive.

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:18.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:19.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Rapid eye movement.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh, mhm.

01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Anybody else?

01:08:22.310 --> 01:08:24.998 align:middle line:84%
>> I felt [INAUDIBLE]
first did it.

01:08:24.998 --> 01:08:25.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:08:25.798 --> 01:08:27.939 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:27.939 --> 01:08:29.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I felt shivers.

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:33.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:36.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a kinetic
energy and shivers,

01:08:36.925 --> 01:08:39.360 align:middle line:84%
like more like a
temperature change as well

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.290 align:middle line:90%
She felt a temperature change.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Did anybody, when you
rolled your eyes up,

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
notice the opening
that was over us?

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.279 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:51.529 align:middle line:84%
Man, you guys should come
to my meditation retreats.

01:08:51.529 --> 01:08:54.425 align:middle line:90%
It's so much fun.

01:08:54.425 --> 01:08:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] where is it?

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm doing one in March, 8,
9, and 10 at 1440 Multiversity,

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:06.979 align:middle line:84%
which is up in-- outside of
San Jose in Scotts Valley.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be a
really nice weekend.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And then one in Utah,
the Four Corners region,

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
at the end of March,
28, 29, and 30.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.510 align:middle line:90%


01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:21.439 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then one in
Oregon out in October.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.779 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going
to take people

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:29.149 align:middle line:84%
to Molokai, the island of
Molokai, in January of 2020.

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:30.229 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:31.189 align:middle line:90%
You have to come.

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.989 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:09:31.989 --> 01:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Where's your booth?

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have a booth.

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:35.569 align:middle line:90%
I have a virtual booth.

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:36.538 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:36.538 --> 01:09:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> You just looked at it.

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.855 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:09:38.855 --> 01:09:39.750 align:middle line:90%


01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:40.550 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] buy the book?

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to be doing
a book signing at 4:15

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
at the book-signing table,
which is the other way,

01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:54.080 align:middle line:90%
kind of by the--

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.085 align:middle line:90%
thank you-- by the registration.

01:09:56.085 --> 01:09:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, so you could get
my book, and I'll sign it.

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:05.990 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's
important, you guys,

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to just recap a couple of
things, that you understand

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:19.820 align:middle line:84%
most of all, from me to
you, that I believe that we

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
must have faith in these times.

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
We must have faith
in these times.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of when
the demigods stopped

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
coming to the people in the
area of Salisbury Plain.

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And they left the sarsen stones
to remind the people of them,

01:10:42.330 --> 01:10:44.480 align:middle line:90%
which is Stonehenge.

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.800 align:middle line:84%
They left them there
to remind the people,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.230 align:middle line:90%
we will always be with you.

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
We will always be here.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
But we may not
physically return.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is what--

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of the place
we're at because we're

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:02.210 align:middle line:84%
at the end of a
phase of humanity.

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:07.320 align:middle line:84%
We all came in at the end
of Atlantis and Lemuria.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We all reincarnated,
lifetime after lifetime,

01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:15.090 align:middle line:84%
with the agreement
and the dedication

01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
to raise the consciousness of
this species that we inhabit.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Our natural state, of
course, is in spirit form.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're coming to
the end of this phase.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean the
earth is ending.

01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
that time is ending.

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're going
to get a job somewhere else.

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:36.708 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.020 align:middle line:90%


01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us are going to
return to our home planets.

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll
reincarnate somewhere else

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and do it all over again.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's we're infinite.

01:11:50.650 --> 01:11:53.610 align:middle line:90%
We are infinite as beings.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry, you
guys, about, oh, will I ever

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:58.590 align:middle line:90%
see them again?

01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:59.507 align:middle line:90%
Will I ever come back?

01:11:59.507 --> 01:12:00.307 align:middle line:90%
Will I ever?

01:12:00.307 --> 01:12:01.160 align:middle line:90%
Will I ever?

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.760 align:middle line:90%
No, you will.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And we will, and we will
all be together again.

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But we have to have faith
because that's really

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:11.810 align:middle line:90%
the thread.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the cord that
keeps us connected.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Without that, we're
just kind of floating

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
around going, hm, what's next?

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Or like my father
used to say, no, I'm

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
going to die, and just get put
in the ground, and that's it.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:28.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like, no, Dad.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:31.620 align:middle line:90%


01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I did prove him wrong.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:37.100 align:middle line:84%
When he passed, I
helped him cross.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And I literally walked
with him all the way up

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
through the light until
they basically turned me

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.820 align:middle line:84%
around and said, you
have to go back now.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:49.280 align:middle line:84%
And he came to me the
next morning, and he said,

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, I did not believe
that this was possible.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
And it was really beautiful.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It was like, yeah, Dad, yeah.

01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It was so cool.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's just a shift.

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:05.400 align:middle line:90%
It's just a shift for all of us.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage you
guys to remember

01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that our purpose, when you want
to know what your purpose is

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth, is to love
each other at the deepest

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
level of our being.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.660 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:18.660 align:middle line:90%


01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:19.960 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:20.760 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.810 align:middle line:90%
