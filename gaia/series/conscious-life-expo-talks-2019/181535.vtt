00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you all.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.990 align:middle line:84%
Thank you all for coming so
early on a Sunday morning.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a morning person, so
I'm so grateful to all of you

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:90%
for being here.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.360 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have never heard me

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:84%
speak before, not read my
book, not seen my TED Talk?

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, how many have never
heard me speak live before?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, quite a few.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
That means I get to use the same
old jokes, and you'll laugh.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.460 align:middle line:84%
I am so happy to be
here, happy to be here

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.910 align:middle line:90%
in this room with all of you--

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.640 align:middle line:84%
with all of you beautiful
people, beautiful souls.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also happy to be alive
here on this physical Earth,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:84%
because if the doctors were
right, the last day of my life

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.310 align:middle line:84%
should have been
February the 2nd, 2006.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.580 align:middle line:90%
That was 13 years ago.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
13 years ago, I should
have left this planet.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sort of here
on borrowed time.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.440 align:middle line:84%
But on that day on
February the 2nd, 2006,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I had end-stage lymphoma--

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:90%
end-stage cancer.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I had cancer for
four years, which

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.000 align:middle line:84%
had spread and metastasized
all over my body.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
It started with a
lump on my neck.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And over a period of
four years, it spread.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.950 align:middle line:84%
It started with a
diagnosis of stage 2.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then it continued to
spread into my breasts and all

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.800 align:middle line:90%
around my neck.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And by 2006, four years
on, I had tumors--

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
many of them the
size of golf balls--

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.680 align:middle line:84%
from the base of my skull, all
around my neck, under my arms,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and in my breasts, all the
way down to my abdomen.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
By that point, the doctors had
given me three months to live.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, my body had
stopped absorbing nutrition.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I had lost so much weight.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I weighed between
80 to 85 pounds.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
My muscles had
completely deteriorated.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't even have
the strength to stand.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't even hold my head up.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
My head would be
hanging down on my neck.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
My neck didn't have the
strength to hold my head up.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.700 align:middle line:84%
My lungs would fill with
fluid and had to be drained

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%
frequently, regularly.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't lie down flat, or
I would choke on my own fluid.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I breathed with the
aid of an oxygen tank.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
I had an oxygen mask on
my face all the time.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.250 align:middle line:90%
I had open skin lesions.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And on February the 2nd,
2006, my organs shut down.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
I had been in so much pain up
until that point and so much

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.530 align:middle line:84%
discomfort, because I couldn't
walk, I couldn't sleep,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.720 align:middle line:84%
because I would choke
on my own fluid.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So I had to be propped
up all the time.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been in so much pain
and so much discomfort--

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
and I even remember that on
the night of February the 1st,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.180 align:middle line:84%
the nurse gave me an
extra shot of morphine,

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
just so that I'd
be able to sleep.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I was so tired.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.520 align:middle line:90%
I was just so tired.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I had been fighting for my life.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I had been fighting
to stay alive.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Up until that point, I felt
I had tried everything,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
and I mean everything,
to stay alive.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And finally, on February
the 1st, I let go.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I stopped fighting.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:90%
I was done.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:90%
I was just done.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And on the morning of February
the 2nd, I didn't wake up.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And my husband, who was frantic,
was calling the doctors.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors said that
my organs had now shut down,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.560 align:middle line:84%
and these were my final
hours, and that I was not

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:90%
going to come out of the coma.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I had gone into a coma.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors informed
him that I was not

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.780 align:middle line:90%
going to come out of the coma.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
My mom was there.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
She was there because I had
been getting sicker and sicker.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.100 align:middle line:84%
They had been contemplating
calling my brother, who

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:90%
was in a different country.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.420 align:middle line:84%
This was happening
to me in Hong Kong.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And they were contemplating
calling my brother, who

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:90%
was in India at the time.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
And up until that point,
I kept saying to them,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
don't concern him, don't worry
him, he's got his family.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But the interesting thing is,
when I went into the coma,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
he sensed something before he
even got a call from anyone

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:90%
in my family.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:90%
He just felt he had to be here.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And he went to the
airport to get a ticket.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And he was already flying
on his way to see me.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
While I was in the coma,
unbeknownst to everyone

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:84%
around me, I had
actually left my body.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time,
all the pain was gone.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.270 align:middle line:10%
And the fear was gone.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And I felt incredible.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that my physical
body was lying there

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
in that hospital bed.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But I felt so free and
magnificent and powerful.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:84%
I felt so expanded and
powerful that my physical body

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
looked so small and
insignificant compared

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:90%
to how I was now feeling.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I was aware that my
family was distraught.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.612 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted them to
know that I was OK.

00:06:26.612 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I really wanted them to know.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But there was no way for me
to communicate with them.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:90%
My physical eyes were closed.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And even though my
physical eyes were closed,

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of
everything that was

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:90%
happening all around the room.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like using
your physical eyes,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:84%
where you have to kind of
turn your head and focus.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:84%
It was more like a
360-degree peripheral vision,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
where I was just
aware of everything.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't able to
communicate with my family.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
But I could feel what
they were feeling.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I had this
feeling-- even though I

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
could see that they
were distraught,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
I had this feeling
that everything's

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.380 align:middle line:90%
going to be OK, even if I died.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I
was going to come back.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
But there was just this
feeling that everything

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:90%
is going to be OK.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
Even if I die, it's OK.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel myself continue
to expand as if I was just--

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:84%
I call it just
pure consciousness.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:90%
And I continued to expand.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was aware
that I was dying.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.140 align:middle line:90%
But it just felt so beautiful.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I felt as though I was
enveloped in a feeling of just

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:90%
pure, unconditional love.

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And I call it "unconditional,"
because actually, there

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.210 align:middle line:84%
is no other kind of love
except unconditional,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
because if it's
not unconditional--

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.610 align:middle line:84%
if it's conditional,
then it's not love.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.237 align:middle line:84%
As soon as love is conditional,
it's not love anymore.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It's something else.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:90%
It's approval.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like seeking approval,
which is conditional.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I felt there
was nothing like I

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
had ever felt in my
physical life before.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
That was the first time
I had that comparison--

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
that oh, my god, all the things
I thought that were love over

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.378 align:middle line:90%
here, were not.

00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It was just me seeking
approval and needing

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
to behave a certain way
to get people to love me

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.539 align:middle line:90%
or to approve of me.

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was loved,
regardless of who I was

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
or what I had done in my life.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:90%
There was no judgment.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:90%
There was no hell.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:84%
As much as many people here
like to believe there is,

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, I can be
certain that there was no hell.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was what I call
a state of clarity, where I

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.310 align:middle line:90%
felt that I understood my life.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I understood why I had
done everything I had done.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I understood why I got cancer.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And basically, you get
to review your own life.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And you get to, not
in a judgmental way,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.400 align:middle line:84%
but in a very
compassionate way, you even

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
get to review the things
you've done wrong,

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:90%
where you've hurt other people.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And you understand
why you did them.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It was just such an
incredible space,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.325 align:middle line:84%
where I even understood
why I had the cancer.

00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I could
sense the presence

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
of other entities,
which is where

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:90%
the love was emanating from.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It felt like I was just
bathed in this love.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think also
what contributes

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to this feeling of love was that
there's no fear in that realm.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It made me realize how fearful
we are here in the physical.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:90%
And we don't need to be.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:90%
We really don't need to be.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
But it made me realize
that we are all

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.750 align:middle line:90%
brought up on a diet of fear.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
I had been brought up
on a diet of fear--

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
fear of not being good
enough, fear of failing,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
fear of disappointing
people, fear of illness--

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:90%
name it, all the fears--

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:90%
fear of failing.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.710 align:middle line:84%
So my entire life had
been a fear-based life.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And once all that
fear was gone, it's

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:90%
like, wow, this was incredible.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.780 align:middle line:84%
I just felt so free
and loved and light.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I realized, for the
first time, that love

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:90%
is the absence of fear.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think love exists
all the time, all the time.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
But we don't feel it, because
fear is a denser energy.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in the state of
fear, I couldn't feel the love.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I was in this state of love, and
I realized, for the first time,

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that I had access
to it my whole life.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
We all do, every
single one of us.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't accessed it,
because the state of fear

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.635 align:middle line:84%
is so heavy and dense that
the love can't come through.

00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And then-- I apologize for
pausing, but there seems--

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.660 align:middle line:90%
is everything OK?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.993 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'll take questions at
the end, if you don't mind.

00:11:49.993 --> 00:11:52.285 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were having
trouble hearing or something,

00:11:52.285 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
that it was something urgent.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Sorry about that.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
I then became aware that I was
surrounded by beings, entities.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And I became aware
that I was surrounded

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.740 align:middle line:84%
by entities, and many
of them who I had

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:90%
known in this physical life.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know all of them.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't recognize all of them.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:33.750 align:middle line:84%
But all I could feel from them
was pure, unconditional love.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like I knew
what they were trying

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with me,
because we didn't need words

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:90%
in that realm.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:90%
There was no language.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%
We were just pure essence.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And I knew what they
wanted me to know.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted me
to know that they

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:90%
had been with me all the time.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And one of those essences,
one of those entities,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:90%
was my deceased father--

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:84%
my dad, who had passed
away 10 years prior.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, I had
a very turbulent relationship

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:90%
with my dad.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And so it was incredible
for me to see him there.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:90%
See, my parents are Hindus--

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Indian.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.200 align:middle line:90%
So my ethnicity, I'm Indian.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:90%
But I've never lived in India.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in a Western culture.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:90%
I went to a Western school.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So I had one foot
in each culture.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
My parents were Indian.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were trying to groom
me for an arranged marriage.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And I rebelled against it.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.995 align:middle line:84%
And as I was growing
up into my late teens

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and they were trying to groom
me for an arranged marriage

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't want
to have anything

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.820 align:middle line:84%
to do with an arranged
marriage, because I wanted

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to be independent and go out and
work and study and everything--

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.300 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to get me to
start to prepare to one day

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:90%
be married.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, in my culture--

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
in Indian culture--
your value as a woman

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.500 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on how valuable
you are to the men in your life.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.250 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:26.030 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that how
desirable you are as a wife

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
is determined by how good
you are at housework.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing--

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:90%
I was crap at housework.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:90%
I hated housework.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:90%
So I felt totally unvaluable.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.050 align:middle line:90%
I felt unworthy.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
was measured against.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.850 align:middle line:10%
So also, to give you an idea
of the kind of person I was,

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:10%
I was a huge fan
of Cyndi Lauper.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
You remember Cyndi Lauper--

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
the "Girls Just Want to
Have Fun" and "True Colors."

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:90%
That was me.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.390 align:middle line:90%
I used to dress like her.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:90%
This was back in the '80s.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
I used to spray my
hair with neon colors.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And now just imagine,
Hindu parents,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to get their
daughter married.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's like trying
to get Cyndi Lauper

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
into an arranged marriage.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.080 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't going to happen.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But finally, what
ended up happening--

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:84%
see, the other thing
is, Indian women,

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
at that time in the
'80s, we were discouraged

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:84%
from higher education, as
well, because it made you

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:90%
too smart and less desirable.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the less
educated you were,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
the easier it was to get you
married, because otherwise, you

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
start to develop a mind of your
own, which they didn't want.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.910 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, all my Indian
friends all succumbed.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:90%
And they all got married.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.490 align:middle line:84%
My Western friends went on to
college, and I became lonely.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I finally succumbed
to an arranged marriage.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got engaged to a guy.

00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:90%
And we were engaged.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And then when I really started
to see what I got into,

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
because I had to learn to
cook his favorite foods

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and learn to clean the house
and learn to do laundry--

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.420 align:middle line:84%
well, all of which
I don't mind doing.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.930 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't allowed
to go back to school

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.690 align:middle line:84%
or go to work or
any of these things.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:84%
When I started to understand
what I was getting into,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
three days before the
wedding, I ran away.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
keep in mind, this

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
was going to be
an Indian wedding,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.820 align:middle line:90%
where they book all the venues.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like those
week-long affairs.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And the relatives fly in
from all over the world.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So three days before
the wedding, I ran away.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And I was ostracized
in our community,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:55.390 align:middle line:84%
because the way it worked back
then-- this was in 1986, 1987.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
The people in our
community believed

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
that if you do that as
a woman, I was spoiled.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So I was labeled as being
spoiled and choosy and all

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of things,
which brought a lot of shame

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:90%
to my family and my parents.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
My parents were told that no
other Indian man would marry me

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
after what I had done.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So they had to deal
with all of that.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I really thought I
had brought a lot of shame

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to my family and to my dad.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I did finally marry
the man that I did marry,

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:35.500 align:middle line:90%
my dad had already passed away.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And so here he was now
on the other side--

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
my dad and me, his
essence and my essence.

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that I would
get judgment from him.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I had carried the guilt of
letting him down and letting

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
my family down.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But all I felt from him was
pure, unconditional love,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:90%
empathy, and compassion.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized is
that when we cross over

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:84%
from here, when we
die, we don't just

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:90%
leave behind our physical body.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We leave behind our gender,
our culture, our race,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:29.260 align:middle line:84%
our religion, and all
the layers of beliefs

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and filters and
lenses that we've

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:90%
accumulated over a lifetime.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:90%
We leave all of that behind.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we leave all of that
behind, what crosses over?

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
What crosses over is
our pure essence--

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.220 align:middle line:84%
our pure essence, which,
to me, is the same

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.150 align:middle line:90%
as pure love or pure God.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:01.795 align:middle line:90%
We can call it whatever we want.

00:19:01.795 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
just as much as I

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.710 align:middle line:84%
had been a victim of my
culture while I was growing up,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.680 align:middle line:84%
my dad was a victim
of the same culture.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
At the end of it, we're
all victims of our filters

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
and our upbringing and
our genders and so on,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:90%
our cultures.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And here we were, both of
us, without any of that, just

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:90%
our pure essence--

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
my dad's pure essence
and my pure essence.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And all we had for each other
was pure, unconditional love.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And unconditional
love is something

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that goes beyond
forgiveness, because in order

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to forgive someone, you
have to believe that they

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:90%
have done something wrong.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.280 align:middle line:90%
So you have to judge them first.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, I'm
going to forgive you

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:90%
for what you've done wrong.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:90%
In that state, it's beyond that.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.680 align:middle line:84%
You see right
through the person,

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and you understand why
they did what they did.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So all you have for them
is compassion and empathy.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So forgiveness is
not even needed.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It goes right to the
soul, the heart, the love,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:90%
the essence of the person.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what it felt
like on the other side.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I realized that every single one
of us have access to that state

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.900 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But all the filters just
crowd it out, block it out.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Everything was so crystal
clear there-- everything.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything was sharper.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
The colors were sharper.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And wherever I put my
awareness, I could be there.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.880 align:middle line:84%
My awareness then
went to my brother.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And I actually knew,
without having been told,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that he was on his way to fly
down to see me before I died.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started to know that,
oh, my physical body better

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
stay alive a little bit
longer, or my brother will

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
be distraught if he gets
there and I'll be dead.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I could
see whatever--

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.780 align:middle line:84%
wherever I put my awareness,
that's what I could see.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I was aware of other lives.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But they felt like they were
happening right here and now.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:84%
I was aware of a
life that I interpret

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
as a past life,
where I recognized

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:90%
my brother, my husband.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.410 align:middle line:90%
But they had other roles.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I could see my future pan
out before me, as well.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But I had the choice of
whether to come back or not.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
I had the choice
of whether I wanted

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:84%
to come back into
this physical body

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
and live out the rest
of this life or not.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And it was so beautiful on
that side that no part of me

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
wanted to come back,
because my body was sick.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was in so
much pain that I

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.520 align:middle line:84%
didn't see any
reason to come back,

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%
because I had been suffering.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:90%
My family had been suffering.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.790 align:middle line:84%
There was no reason
to come back.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:84%
But in those moments, because
I was in this state of clarity,

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
it's like, as soon as I would
have a thought, an awareness,

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
a focus on something, the
answer would come right away.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
It was like, immediately,
the answer would come.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
In that state of clarity,
I was understanding

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.850 align:middle line:90%
why I had the cancer.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:84%
I understood how every thought
and every decision that

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:84%
had been made from
a place of fear

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:55.990 align:middle line:84%
had contributed to me
lying on that hospital

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.660 align:middle line:90%
bed in that moment, dying.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I understood how and why
it was that I was dying.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I understood what
my purpose had been.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I understood what my intention
had been when I first

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:90%
came into this world.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I understood how
I had lost my way.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:90%
All of that was so clear to me.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to get the clarity

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:90%
that if I chose to go back--

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and I feel it was my dad
that was helping me to get

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.360 align:middle line:90%
to this place of clarity--

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that if I chose to go back,
now that I knew this--

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.320 align:middle line:90%
now that I knew this truth--

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that my body would heal
very, very quickly.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:48.670 align:middle line:84%
I started to understand that
illness is not physical.

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.060 align:middle line:90%
It's metaphysical.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I understood that my
physical body was only

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of the
metaphysical me--

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.260 align:middle line:90%
the soul me, the rest of me.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
understand, because I

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:90%
had feared all the treatments.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:90%
I feared cancer.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:90%
I feared the treatments.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And I started to understand,
while I was there,

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
that what I had, what
I was going through,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.080 align:middle line:84%
my physical illness,
was not something

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that was treatable
from the physical,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.690 align:middle line:84%
because it was my choice
whether I wanted to stay or go.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing,
also, was that I

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
was shown what I would be
doing if I chose to come back.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I was shown that the illness
would heal very, very quickly.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't forced
to come back.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:44.280 align:middle line:84%
I was even shown that
if I chose to leave,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.290 align:middle line:84%
my medical records
would show that I

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
died from organ failure
due to end-stage cancer.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But if I chose to
go back, my organs

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.960 align:middle line:90%
would start functioning again.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And so I could see all of this.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was so clear.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my dad
started to say to me,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:90%
it's not your time.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.450 align:middle line:84%
If you don't go back, you won't
have fulfilled your purpose.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And he told me that my husband's
purpose was linked to mine.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had felt so sad that
my dad hadn't been there

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to see my husband
and I get married.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
He wanted me to know
that he was there.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.850 align:middle line:84%
He had seen us get married,
even though I couldn't see him.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted me to know that
I was meant to be with Danny.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it didn't work
with the previous person.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Danny was my soul
mate, is my soul mate,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and that we had a purpose.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.450 align:middle line:90%
And our purpose was linked.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't go
back, he wouldn't

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.305 align:middle line:84%
be able to fulfill
his purpose, either.

00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And so it was in
that moment that I

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.040 align:middle line:90%
made the choice to go back.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, my dad said,
now that you know this truth,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
go back and live
your life fearlessly.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And it was in those
moments that I started

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:90%
to come out of the coma.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I came out of the
coma, I saw my family around me.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.410 align:middle line:90%
My brother was there.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.860 align:middle line:90%
He'd gotten off the plane.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was right there, and
my mom, and my husband, Danny.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
come out of the coma.

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in the coma for
only a day and a half--

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.870 align:middle line:90%
about 30 hours.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'd gone in the coma
on February the 2nd.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I came out of it on
February the 3rd.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was still really groggy,
like one foot on each side.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was saying to them,
I'm going to be fine.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about me.

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Dad told me it's
not my time to go.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.555 align:middle line:90%
He's here.

00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:55.490 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't know what
I was talking about.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:90%
So they said, what?

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I'm fine, really.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to tell them things

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that had been happening in the
room while I was in the coma--

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.730 align:middle line:84%
things which there was
no way for me to know.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And so they knew something
strange had happened.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.410 align:middle line:84%
They called my
doctor to come in.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And when the doctor came in,
I started to tell him things

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, you took
fluid out of my lungs.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
I was choking at
4:00 in the morning,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:84%
and you took fluid
out of my lungs.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:27.140 align:middle line:90%
And he said, how do you know?

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
You were in a coma.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you
could know that.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I said
to Danny, I said,

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.710 align:middle line:84%
that's the doctor that told you
that these are my final hours,

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not even going to
make it through the night.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And Danny said, there's no
way you could have heard that.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
He said that to me down the
hallway, about 40 feet away

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.330 align:middle line:90%
from your room.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so all these things
started to come up,

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:90%
where I was describing things.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I was describing the nurse who
was poking tubes into my veins.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.250 align:middle line:90%
And it was a male nurse.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And he couldn't find my veins.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually saying,
her veins have retracted.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And they were resigning
themselves to the fact

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:90%
that it was too late, anyway.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:90%
I was gone, anyway.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I was recollecting
all of this for all of them.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:90%
And they were really surprised.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, within four days,
the tumors shrunk by 70%.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:84%
The doctors didn't
even know what

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to write in my medical records.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
My oncologist made the
gesture of throwing

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:90%
my file into the trash.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.440 align:middle line:84%
He was like, I don't even
know what to write in here.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
what to make of you.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what he said.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I am so grateful this happened
to me in the hospital,

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.150 align:middle line:84%
because I have the medical
records to prove it,

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.060 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't aware
of the challenges

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.710 align:middle line:84%
that I would get
later from people

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
who question and question.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So I'm so thankful that
it happened in a hospital.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.810 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, four days later,
after coming out of the coma,

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.270 align:middle line:90%
the tumors shrunk by 70%.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to pull
all the tubes and--

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.620 align:middle line:90%
I was off the breathing tube.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.248 align:middle line:90%
I was off the nutrition tube.

00:29:18.248 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And I was off on a lot
of these different tubes.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting up,
and I was talking.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors really just
couldn't figure it out.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and my organs started
functioning again.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had these
open skin lesions,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.450 align:middle line:84%
which the doctors
thought that they

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.100 align:middle line:84%
would need to use reconstructive
surgery to heal them,

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
because they said, your body
is so weak and so devoid

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.430 align:middle line:84%
of nutrition, you don't have
the strength for that to heal.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.920 align:middle line:90%
They healed by themselves.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.120 align:middle line:84%
In three and 1/2 weeks, they
could find no trace of cancer

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.283 align:middle line:90%
in my body.

00:29:57.283 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They were just waiting
for me to get stronger.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, I was strong
enough to leave the hospital

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and go home and to live
my life cancer-free.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And that was 13 years ago.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.805 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:14.805 --> 00:30:15.755 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:15.755 --> 00:30:20.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So now, though, you'd
think that, OK, I go home,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:84%
live my life cancer-free, and
it's all peachy and roses.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell
you something, that

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:84%
was when the challenge began,
because here's what happens.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
When I went home, I realized
the person that came out

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital was a different
person from the one who

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.470 align:middle line:90%
went into the hospital.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.960 align:middle line:84%
The person that went
into the hospital

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
was someone who was
really scared of cancer,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
really scared of disappointing
people, really scared

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.580 align:middle line:90%
of letting people down.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:90%
I was really scared of illness.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Every decision I made in
my life came from a place

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.030 align:middle line:90%
of fear instead of love.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.470 align:middle line:90%
I was a people-pleaser.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:90%
I was a doormat.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:90%
I had completely lost myself.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Now I realize that the most
important thing I could do

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.720 align:middle line:84%
was to love and honor
myself and to be who I am--

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.580 align:middle line:90%
to truly be who I am.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And I was, in a strange
way, a little bit

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.860 align:middle line:84%
scared of doing it
in the community

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:47.270 align:middle line:84%
that I was in, because
the community was

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the community I was in that I
had built as a people-pleaser.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if I was to go
back to the life I had before

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and be the person
I was before, that

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:07.910 align:middle line:84%
was the person who got cancer,
because I now knew that cancer

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:10.040 align:middle line:90%
is not a physical disease.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:84%
I understood that the
cancer was not my enemy.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.100 align:middle line:84%
People say to me, the
cancer damn near killed you.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.500 align:middle line:10%
And I say, no, I was killing
myself before the cancer.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The cancer came to
me to save my life.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't listening to it.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I continued
to not listen to it.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I continued to not listen
to the wake-up calls

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.950 align:middle line:90%
until I reached near-death.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I tell people, I couldn't
have been very smart

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that it took death for
me to realize this--

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that it took death for me to
realize that all I have to do

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.580 align:middle line:90%
is be myself.

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:90%
And that is the crux of it.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.740 align:middle line:84%
When I learned that
I had to come back

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:90%
and fulfill my purpose--

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
your purpose, your purpose,
your purpose, your purpose,

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.180 align:middle line:90%
and my purpose are all the same.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.830 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very simple, but
we make it really complicated.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:90%
Our purpose is to be who we are.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.050 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.490 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing more than that.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's also to love ourselves.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And what do I mean
by "love ourselves"?

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Many people think
that loving ourselves

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:34.720 align:middle line:84%
means just going for massages
and going for spa dates

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And people say, I love
myself, I treat myself a lot,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.070 align:middle line:84%
but my life still
isn't working for me.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you think
loving yourself is selfish?

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Or how many of you
were brought up

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to believe that loving
yourself is selfish?

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So I was brought up to
believe that loving myself

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.300 align:middle line:90%
is selfish, too.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And quite a lot of you--

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:90%
I saw a lot of hands go up.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Here's where I learned
completely differently

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.760 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.880 align:middle line:84%
What I realized is
that we are all much

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.280 align:middle line:90%
more than our physical bodies.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:14.260 align:middle line:10%
So I want you to imagine this.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Imagine an iceberg.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
When you look at an
iceberg, even a picture

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of an iceberg, what
you're really seeing

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.179 align:middle line:90%
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Does everyone know that?

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:90%
That most of the iceberg--

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.900 align:middle line:84%
a much bigger part
of the iceberg--

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.760 align:middle line:90%
is beneath the water.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:90%
And you can't see it.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:84%
There's about 80%
more iceberg that you

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.770 align:middle line:90%
can't see than you can.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with us.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the same with you and me.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.400 align:middle line:90%
80% of us, you can't see.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And we never developed a
language to tap into it.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.360 align:middle line:84%
When we were born, we knew
that we were much more

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:90%
than our physical bodies.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.650 align:middle line:84%
What you see here--
your physical body,

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.090 align:middle line:90%
my physical body--

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.870 align:middle line:84%
is only a small percentage
of who we really are.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.660 align:middle line:84%
When I died, I realized
I was much bigger.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.480 align:middle line:84%
My space takes up
much more space

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.760 align:middle line:90%
than just where I'm standing.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And so does yours and yours and
yours and yours and all of you.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can actually
sense each other,

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
whether we care to
admit it or not.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.680 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think
your pet dog knows

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:84%
when you're coming home long
before your dog can see you?

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because they're aware of
the rest of their iceberg.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.280 align:middle line:90%
We have denied it from birth.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.230 align:middle line:84%
We've not even
given it language.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So we don't even
consider it a thing.

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you are aware
of it as a child,

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.360 align:middle line:84%
you're told it's
your imagination.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so you start to push it out
and push it away and deny it.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
told that all we are

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.180 align:middle line:84%
is five sensory,
three-dimensional physical

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.630 align:middle line:90%
beings.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:03.086 align:middle line:90%
But in actuality, we're not.

00:36:03.086 --> 00:36:04.580 align:middle line:90%
We're not.

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're living
in so much fear, because we

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:90%
don't see the whole picture.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.900 align:middle line:90%
We don't see the whole iceberg.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I discovered
when I was in the other side--

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.440 align:middle line:90%
that we are all connected.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.730 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:25.070 align:middle line:90%
We're all in this hole together.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much more to
us than this physical body.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And that "more" part of us
overlaps with everybody.

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So if I am in fear,
what am I doing?

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking this fear
with me wherever I go.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.810 align:middle line:84%
If I don't love myself and I
loathe myself, what am I doing?

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking it with
me wherever I go.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm spreading it
to everybody around me,

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:50.270 align:middle line:84%
because the rest of my
iceberg is touching yours

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and yours and yours.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we're doing today.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think there's
so much fear in the world?

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
Because we don't realize it.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing fear.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.280 align:middle line:90%
We're spreading fear.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:90%
What is love?

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.320 align:middle line:90%
Love is the absence of fear.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
To me, love is realizing
you are the whole iceberg.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Fear is thinking you're just
the tip of the iceberg--

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.120 align:middle line:90%
that this is all I am.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.360 align:middle line:84%
And my tip of the
iceberg has to please

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.380 align:middle line:84%
that tip of the iceberg in
order to win their approval,

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:28.420 align:middle line:84%
or I won't be popular,
or they won't like me.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.520 align:middle line:90%
And so what do we do?

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.930 align:middle line:90%
We shrink ourselves.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:90%
And we make ourselves small.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And we bring this fear-based
self wherever we go.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And instead of touching
everybody's lives with love,

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.350 align:middle line:84%
we touch everybody's lives
with fear, because all of us

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.890 align:middle line:90%
are part of a whole.

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, here's the
other thing I learned.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.790 align:middle line:84%
When I say we're
all connected, I

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.570 align:middle line:84%
use the analogy of
fingers on a hand.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if each finger
thought they were

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.410 align:middle line:90%
a separate, individual being.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.620 align:middle line:84%
Each finger thought they were
a separate, individual being.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.980 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if they
thought, I have

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.123 align:middle line:84%
to get ahead of
these other fingers,

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.790 align:middle line:84%
because there isn't
enough to go around,

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and I have to get
ahead of them, and I

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.190 align:middle line:84%
have to get the job before
they do, or compete with them

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:20.660 align:middle line:84%
and make more
money than they do.

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they're fighting
with each other,

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
competing with each other,
trying to get ahead.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And when they die, they
realize, oh, my gosh, we're

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.480 align:middle line:90%
all part of the same hand.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.980 align:middle line:84%
If we worked together,
we could have

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.770 align:middle line:84%
gone so much further
and done so much more,

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:90%
because we're all one.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:35.800 align:middle line:90%
We're one.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:84%
We're part of one entity, one
essence, one consciousness.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:45.950 align:middle line:84%
So my consciousness is connected
to yours and yours and yours

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.480 align:middle line:90%
and yours.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's too bad we only
realize this when we die.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first question
is, why do we only realize this

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.670 align:middle line:90%
when we die?

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And the answer I got was, no,
we knew it when we were born.

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.210 align:middle line:84%
But it got
conditioned out of us.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And so each of us
are all connected.

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
don't love yourself--

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.320 align:middle line:84%
when you don't love
yourself, what happens

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:84%
is that space of lack
of love gets taken over

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:21.200 align:middle line:84%
by fear, because when you
don't love yourself-- so let

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.330 align:middle line:90%
me make it even clearer for you.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.510 align:middle line:84%
If we are all part
of one consciousness,

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:32.120 align:middle line:84%
consciousness has chosen to
come here and represent itself

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:90%
as all of us.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.760 align:middle line:90%
And we can call it God.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:84%
God has chosen to come
and express itself

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.020 align:middle line:84%
as you and you and
you and you and me.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:49.550 align:middle line:84%
God has chosen to express itself
in all these different forms.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
expressing itself

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.770 align:middle line:90%
in all these different forms.

00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:59.480 align:middle line:84%
When you love yourself,
you allow God consciousness

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:04.250 align:middle line:84%
to express itself through you
in the way you were meant to.

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:08.330 align:middle line:84%
You allow yourself to
be who you truly are.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.630 align:middle line:84%
When you don't
love yourself, you

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:15.230 align:middle line:84%
think you are
undeserving and unworthy.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And so you try to be who
everyone else wants you to be.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
you lose yourself.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.600 align:middle line:90%
That's how you lose yourself.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.030 align:middle line:84%
That's how we get
into a state of fear--

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.670 align:middle line:84%
a fear of what everyone
else is thinking of us,

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.940 align:middle line:90%
a fear of disappointing people.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Does anyone relate to that?

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Being in fear of
disappointing people?

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:41.350 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
trouble being who you are

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.476 align:middle line:90%
and expressing who you are?

00:40:44.476 --> 00:40:46.550 align:middle line:90%
See, quite a few of you.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:49.010 align:middle line:90%
So many people relate to this.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you are an
empath, which I

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.060 align:middle line:84%
gather most people in a
conference like this would be,

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.310 align:middle line:90%
you feel it even more.

00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.220 align:middle line:84%
You actually feel the emotions
of other people even more.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it becomes
even more important

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:84%
for you to actually love
yourself and find your joy.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:09.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So what does loving
yourself mean?

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:17.740 align:middle line:84%
It means finding your joy,
following your passion.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.350 align:middle line:84%
But here's the hardest
part for people

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:22.180 align:middle line:90%
who don't love themselves.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.620 align:middle line:84%
To learn to love
themselves, this

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is the hardest thing
you have to do.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:30.490 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
saying no to things that

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:33.950 align:middle line:90%
no longer feel right to you.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:40.340 align:middle line:84%
So many people who
come to my conferences

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and come to conferences and read
books and read my books and so

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:50.150 align:middle line:84%
on, we all fall into
this trap, where we think

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.340 align:middle line:90%
we need to do more, learn more.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And when things go wrong in
our life-- when we feel fear,

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:84%
we think, oh, my gosh, what do
I need to do to get rid of it?

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.260 align:middle line:90%
What more do I need to learn?

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're really judgmental
on ourselves, because we say,

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.483 align:middle line:84%
I'm on this path, I've
read all these books,

00:42:05.483 --> 00:42:06.830 align:middle line:90%
I've been to all these courses.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:07.630 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.380 align:middle line:90%
What am I not getting?

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, sometimes we
have to do it the other way.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
we're doing too much.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.420 align:middle line:84%
The problem is, we're
beating ourselves

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.908 align:middle line:84%
up, thinking that we're
still not getting it.

00:42:22.908 --> 00:42:24.950 align:middle line:84%
We're beating ourselves
up, thinking that there's

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:27.350 align:middle line:90%
more we have to do and be.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.300 align:middle line:84%
What if it's the
other way around?

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.560 align:middle line:84%
What if I told you, you
already are everything

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.450 align:middle line:90%
you are trying to attain?

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.800 align:middle line:90%
You already are.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But you have been convinced,
or convinced to believe,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that there is something
wrong with you.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So you are now going out in
search of how to correct it.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But in actuality, there
is nothing wrong with you.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I like to use the
metaphor of Michelangelo.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo used to carve these
beautiful statues of angels--

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.890 align:middle line:90%
beautiful statues.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And people used to
say to him, how can

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.400 align:middle line:84%
you carve these
beautiful statues

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.760 align:middle line:84%
from these blocks of
marbles without any plans

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.950 align:middle line:84%
or without any
drawings or sketches?

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:21.350 align:middle line:90%
He just chips away.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And he carves up an angel.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And he says, the angel
is already there.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:32.120 align:middle line:84%
All I do is chip away at what
is not part of the angel.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.050 align:middle line:90%
And I set the angel free.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:38.530 align:middle line:84%
So what if I was to tell you,
there is nothing more that you

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:90%
need to do or be or learn?

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.510 align:middle line:90%
But it's the opposite.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.370 align:middle line:84%
You need to let go
of what is not you.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Chip away at what is not
you, and set that angel free.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Set your heart free.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Set your soul free.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what your soul is
really crying out for.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And the way I do that is, we
start by saying things like,

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.780 align:middle line:84%
where have I said
"yes" when I mean "no"?

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:12.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've said "yes" for the
wrong reasons, because I'm

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:90%
afraid of disappointing people.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of what people
think of me, because that's

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.265 align:middle line:84%
one way that we add
all these layers.

00:44:21.265 --> 00:44:26.890 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, what have
I taken on that's not mine?

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:39.020 align:middle line:84%
What have I taken
on that's not mine?

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Am I doing things
for other people?

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Or am I getting into dramas
that are not my dramas,

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.240 align:middle line:90%
into other people's fears?

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So here's where you get drawn
in really, really easily.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.920 align:middle line:90%
And we're in this climate--

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:84%
when I say "this
climate," about the things

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that are going on in
the world right now.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of things
that feel scary and dark.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And you get drawn
in, because people

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:12.060 align:middle line:84%
make you feel guilty that
you have to be in this--

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe a campaign that makes
you feel angry or makes

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.110 align:middle line:84%
you research things that
makes you feel really angry

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:21.270 align:middle line:90%
and makes you feel fearful.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Or even our medical system
comes from a fear-based place.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Our medical system is focused
on looking for illness.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not focused on wellness.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.900 align:middle line:84%
It's focused on
looking for illness.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So all these things are always
focused on the darkness.

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:84%
What I always say is that,
especially in this world

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.120 align:middle line:90%
right now--

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.520 align:middle line:90%
the climate the way it is--

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.620 align:middle line:84%
it's really important that
you focus on your light.

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And don't allow
people, using guilt,

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.610 align:middle line:84%
or you trying to please people,
and people who have dramas,

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:02.580 align:middle line:84%
or people who are involved in
things that you don't like--

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.400 align:middle line:90%
don't allow them to draw you in.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:84%
You are not helping people by
stepping into the darkness.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.190 align:middle line:84%
You help people by
holding onto the light.

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And don't feel guilty about it.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.040 align:middle line:90%
That's super important.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:84%
So now, the other thing
is, let's talk a little bit

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.320 align:middle line:90%
about illness.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And I want to also share a
little bit of a meditation

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.140 align:middle line:84%
with you, because I've created
a new meditation, taking people

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.520 align:middle line:84%
into their own
near-death experience.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I wanted to
do is share a 10--

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:90%
live.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:37.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this live--

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.010 align:middle line:84%
share a 10 or 15-minute
sample with you.

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And then-- bless you.

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And then we can go into
a couple of questions,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.740 align:middle line:90%
if there's time at the end.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:51.520 align:middle line:90%
So a little bit about illness--

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.030 align:middle line:84%
your body is much
smarter than you think.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Your body is capable
of so much more

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.020 align:middle line:90%
than you've been led to believe.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
our medical system

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:06.150 align:middle line:84%
is fear-focused, as opposed
to love or health-focused.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:90%
Unfortunately, this is the case.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.620 align:middle line:84%
If it were up to
me, I would actually

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:16.170 align:middle line:84%
separate medical hospitals
from emergency hospitals.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:84%
In other words, accidents and
emergencies would be hospitals.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But people dealing
with illnesses

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.370 align:middle line:84%
would go into something
else that I might call

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:28.920 align:middle line:90%
healing sanctuaries, retreats.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.180 align:middle line:84%
They need something
very different.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.820 align:middle line:84%
They need to be in
a place that makes

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:39.300 align:middle line:84%
them feel welcomed and loved,
because here's the irony.

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Fear stresses your
immune system.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Fear actually puts you
in fight or flight,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:48.660 align:middle line:90%
which stops your immune system.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.030 align:middle line:90%
How many of you fear hospitals?

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.560 align:middle line:90%
Raise your hand.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a lot.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.220 align:middle line:84%
There's probably
60%, 70% of you.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't it ironic that
the place that you're

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.170 align:middle line:84%
supposed to go for
healing actually

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:84%
suppresses your immune system,
which is what you need most?

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So if it were up to
me, healing centers

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:12.000 align:middle line:84%
would do the opposite
of what hospitals do.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.370 align:middle line:90%
You need to be asked questions.

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:18.030 align:middle line:84%
If you go in with an
illness, a diagnosis,

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you need to be asked questions
like, are you lonely?

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Have you suffered
a trauma recently?

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:middle line:84%
Does your life have
meaning and purpose?

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:31.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Do you have people in
your life who love you?

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Are there people in
your life who you love?

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that there's
passion and humor in your life?

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Do you have fun?

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you have joy?

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.370 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any deep issues?

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.470 align:middle line:90%
Are you having financial issues?

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Do you have people
dependent on you

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.370 align:middle line:84%
who you're afraid
of letting down?

00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:02.820 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds of things
that coaches or people need

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.240 align:middle line:84%
to dig deeper, in order
to really heal where

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.110 align:middle line:90%
the illness is coming from.

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So if it were up to me, we
would have healing sanctuaries,

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:16.110 align:middle line:84%
where, instead of all medical
doctors and radiologists

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and people like that,
we would actually

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:24.390 align:middle line:84%
have a team of coaches who would
help you through your issues.

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you needed physical
support, in whatever way--

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.450 align:middle line:84%
in plant medicine or anything
like that-- you would get that,

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:34.570 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, you
would have other work done.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.220 align:middle line:84%
A dear friend of
mine, Sue Morter,

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.060 align:middle line:84%
does beautiful work-- beautiful
healing work-- on the body.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And hers is really
powerful, by the way.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.840 align:middle line:84%
So there would be so many
modalities like that for you

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.100 align:middle line:84%
to choose from in a healing
sanctuary that could really

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.170 align:middle line:84%
get to the bottom
of your healing

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and allow whatever needs
to be released, to release.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I know that if I had
something like that,

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I would have healed
without having to die,

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:15.400 align:middle line:84%
because for me, the fear
of the illness was huge.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.910 align:middle line:90%
I was so scared of cancer.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:19.030 align:middle line:90%
I was so afraid.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I was watching my best
friend die of cancer.

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was so afraid of cancer.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And what I started to do was
that I started to do everything

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.450 align:middle line:90%
to prevent cancer.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:37.710 align:middle line:84%
I started to live my life
to prevent getting cancer.

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I started to research all
the natural supplements.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would take
boatloads of supplements.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And I started to grow
my own wheat grass.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would take wheat
grass juice every morning.

00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I went completely raw vegan.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I would be paranoid if I
missed a dose of supplements.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I would not eat sweets
or cheesecake or anything

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:08.580 align:middle line:90%
or chocolate or anything.

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.370 align:middle line:90%
I was no fun at all.

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:90%
I'd lost my sense of humor.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I totally had lost
my sense of humor,

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.750 align:middle line:84%
because I was so scared
of getting cancer.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.120 align:middle line:90%
And you know what happened?

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.610 align:middle line:90%
I got cancer.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not saying
don't eat healthy.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.790 align:middle line:10%
But I'll tell you
what's more important.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the fear.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It's the fear.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat healthy from
a place of loving your body

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and loving your life, that
is so much better for you.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you know that your body

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:48.758 align:middle line:84%
is more resilient than you've
been led to believe it is.

00:51:48.758 --> 00:51:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
have that cheesecake

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:54.450 align:middle line:84%
or that glass of wine or that
piece of chocolate, enjoy it.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Just enjoy it.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And what really matters is
going out with people you love

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and sharing food
with people you love

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.760 align:middle line:84%
and cooking food in
the space of energy,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.730 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
actually eating

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.190 align:middle line:90%
is only a very small part of it.

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:16.620 align:middle line:84%
It really is, because in the
end, everything is energy.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So what I'd like
to do right now is,

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I would like to take you
all on a little meditation,

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.340 align:middle line:90%
if you'll let me.

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:35.790 align:middle line:90%
And just relax.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
be 10 or 15 minutes.

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll
bring you out of it,

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and then give you some
time to ask me questions.

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:48.280 align:middle line:90%


00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And put your feet on the ground.

00:52:54.690 --> 00:53:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:11.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:25.530 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to just feel
the muscles and just relax.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Feel any tension in your
muscles just melting away.

00:53:31.570 --> 00:53:35.320 align:middle line:10%
You can close your
eyes, if you wish.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:40.170 align:middle line:10%
And if you choose not
to close your eyes,

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.605 align:middle line:10%
we have some nice visuals
going on on the screens.

00:53:43.605 --> 00:53:54.070 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Feel the muscles in
your neck and shoulders

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.230 align:middle line:10%
just melting away.

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.570 align:middle line:10%
Feel the muscles in your legs
and feet just melting away.

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:25.620 align:middle line:10%
Now, what I'd like you to
do is to imagine your life

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:10%
five years from now.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:36.440 align:middle line:10%
See yourself moving forward
in time, five years from now.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:41.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, see yourself moving forward
in time 10 years from now,

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.450 align:middle line:10%
15 years from now.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:51.940 align:middle line:10%
Now, imagine that you are
at the end of your life.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:04.670 align:middle line:10%
And just see yourself right
at the end of your life,

00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:14.310 align:middle line:10%
lying on a beautiful bed
with silk sheets surrounded

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:17.580 align:middle line:10%
by your loved ones.

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:25.620 align:middle line:10%
And you are aware that
with your next breath,

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:29.030 align:middle line:10%
you will be leaving
your physical body.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.680 align:middle line:10%
So take a deep breath in.

00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.490 align:middle line:90%


00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:41.220 align:middle line:10%
And as you breathe
out, see yourself

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:46.860 align:middle line:10%
stepping into a beautiful,
beautiful, colorful abyss that

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:48.240 align:middle line:10%
waits in front of you.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.540 align:middle line:90%


00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:57.740 align:middle line:10%
Allow it to look like
whatever you want--

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.395 align:middle line:10%
anything that brings
you comfort and joy.

00:56:00.395 --> 00:56:05.520 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.442 align:middle line:10%
What color is it?

00:56:07.442 --> 00:56:10.810 align:middle line:10%
What do you see?

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:11.950 align:middle line:10%
Butterflies?

00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:13.090 align:middle line:10%
Rainbows?

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:14.440 align:middle line:10%
Mountains?

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.930 align:middle line:10%
Sky?

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:19.260 align:middle line:10%
Let it take whatever
form it likes.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, start to become
aware of all the tension

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:37.160 align:middle line:10%
and stresses of this life
that have fallen away.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.730 align:middle line:10%
Become aware of
how light you feel.

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:47.474 align:middle line:90%


00:56:47.474 --> 00:56:53.585 align:middle line:10%
You have left all the tension
of the physical body behind.

00:56:53.585 --> 00:56:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.340 align:middle line:10%
Feel how light
and free you feel.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:18.250 align:middle line:10%
Now, start to notice
that you're surrounded

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:22.900 align:middle line:10%
by a feeling of
unconditional love.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:24.750 align:middle line:10%
It just envelopes you.

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:27.730 align:middle line:10%


00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.770 align:middle line:10%
This feeling has
no judgment at all.

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:35.620 align:middle line:90%


00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:37.930 align:middle line:10%
It just loves you
for who you are.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.525 align:middle line:10%
Just bathe in this feeling.

00:57:47.525 --> 00:57:54.070 align:middle line:90%


00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:58.780 align:middle line:10%
Every discomfort, pain, hurt
that you've ever felt is gone--

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.756 align:middle line:10%
just gone, washed away.

00:58:00.756 --> 00:58:03.720 align:middle line:10%


00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:13.535 align:middle line:10%
You feel amazing, powerful,
magnificent, and free.

00:58:13.535 --> 00:58:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:35.380 align:middle line:10%
You start to become aware that
this is your pure essence.

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.760 align:middle line:10%
This is who you truly are.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:48.430 align:middle line:10%
Now you start to notice a
presence in front of you.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:53.510 align:middle line:90%


00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:58.530 align:middle line:10%
It's a person, a being, a soul--

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.890 align:middle line:10%
a soul.

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:05.865 align:middle line:10%
It's the essence-- the bright,
shining, beautiful essence.

00:59:05.865 --> 00:59:09.050 align:middle line:90%


00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:12.500 align:middle line:10%
Allow them to take
on any identity that

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.323 align:middle line:10%
brings you comfort--

00:59:15.323 --> 00:59:21.570 align:middle line:10%
absolutely any, whether it's
an angel or an ascended master

00:59:21.570 --> 00:59:24.635 align:middle line:10%
or a deceased loved one.

00:59:24.635 --> 00:59:26.120 align:middle line:10%
Who do you see?

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.610 align:middle line:10%
They have a message for you.

00:59:44.610 --> 00:59:48.470 align:middle line:90%


00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:49.555 align:middle line:10%
What is their message?

00:59:49.555 --> 00:59:53.940 align:middle line:90%


00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:04.620 align:middle line:10%
Their message-- their message is
positive and pure and is going

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:07.100 align:middle line:10%
to take you to another level--

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.285 align:middle line:10%
a higher level--
of your own self.

01:00:09.285 --> 01:00:11.900 align:middle line:10%


01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:18.860 align:middle line:10%
Listen to what they have
to say and trust it.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:39.570 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:45.090 align:middle line:10%
This beautiful being now
wraps you in a warm embrace.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:49.740 align:middle line:90%


01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Feel it.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:57.580 align:middle line:10%
Feel their love and
their authenticity.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.400 align:middle line:10%
They want you to know
that you're safe.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:05.910 align:middle line:10%
You're safe to be as
powerful as you can be.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:08.730 align:middle line:10%
You're safe to be as
big as you can be.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:11.400 align:middle line:10%


01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
Your purpose is to be
all that you can be.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:21.905 align:middle line:90%


01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:23.366 align:middle line:10%
And they are with you.

01:01:23.366 --> 01:01:26.290 align:middle line:10%


01:01:26.290 --> 01:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
Their job is to keep you safe.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:34.707 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:38.699 align:middle line:10%
They are with you.

01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:40.695 align:middle line:10%
And they are never leaving you.

01:01:40.695 --> 01:01:51.700 align:middle line:90%


01:01:51.700 --> 01:02:00.670 align:middle line:10%
Now this being says
you need to go back.

01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:03.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not your time to
be on this other side.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:07.560 align:middle line:90%


01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.860 align:middle line:10%
And even though it's
so beautiful here--

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.365 align:middle line:10%
you want to be here forever--

01:02:12.365 --> 01:02:14.980 align:middle line:10%


01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:19.364 align:middle line:10%
the being says, your
work is not done.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:21.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm with you.

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.586 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to help you fulfill
whatever you need to fulfill,

01:02:25.586 --> 01:02:29.010 align:middle line:10%
but you need to go back
into your physical body.

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.164 align:middle line:90%


01:02:32.164 --> 01:02:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And this being guides you.

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:41.620 align:middle line:10%
So now, in your
mind's eye, I want

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:48.280 align:middle line:10%
you to see yourself as a
beautiful beam of light that

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.130 align:middle line:10%
is entering your physical
body from the crown.

01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:56.680 align:middle line:10%
Let the beam of light,
which is actually

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.975 align:middle line:10%
you, your soul, your essence--

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:03.370 align:middle line:10%
let the beam of light enter
your body through your crown

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:08.380 align:middle line:10%
and take on any color
that it wishes to take on.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.010 align:middle line:10%
And let this beam of
light fill your body--

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.810 align:middle line:10%
completely fill your body--

01:03:14.810 --> 01:03:20.830 align:middle line:10%
and radiate outwards so
that it is far greater

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.180 align:middle line:10%
than your body itself.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.460 align:middle line:10%
It extends outwards.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.570 align:middle line:10%
It can be any color you wish
or combination of colors.

01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And this beam of light is so
strong and powerful that it

01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:38.960 align:middle line:10%
creates a big aura-- a big
ball of aura around you

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.415 align:middle line:10%
to protect you with light.

01:03:40.415 --> 01:03:43.920 align:middle line:90%


01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.800 align:middle line:10%
And this beam of
light shoots out

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:51.670 align:middle line:10%
through the soles of your
feet and into the Earth

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:56.150 align:middle line:10%
to ground you in this physical
so that you shall always

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:59.680 align:middle line:10%
feel grounded here
while you are here.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.910 align:middle line:10%
And as it shoots
out into the earth,

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:09.720 align:middle line:10%
it branches out so that it has
a nice, strong foothold here,

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.380 align:middle line:10%
because for now, you
are meant to be here,

01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:16.900 align:middle line:10%
because you have a purpose.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:17.935 align:middle line:10%
You have a purpose.

01:04:17.935 --> 01:04:20.760 align:middle line:10%


01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.835 align:middle line:10%
And your purpose
is becoming clear.

01:04:22.835 --> 01:04:26.096 align:middle line:90%


01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:28.280 align:middle line:10%
your purpose is clarifying.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:36.830 align:middle line:90%


01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And slowly, I want you to start
feeling your physical body

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:41.580 align:middle line:10%
again.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.260 align:middle line:10%


01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:49.890 align:middle line:10%
Your body is feeling
powerful and strong

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:52.590 align:middle line:10%
and with intention and purpose.

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:56.580 align:middle line:90%


01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:03.530 align:middle line:10%
Start to feel your neck, your
head, your arms, your legs,

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:04.900 align:middle line:10%
your fingers, and your toes.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:11.080 align:middle line:90%


01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:17.040 align:middle line:10%
And whenever you're ready,
you can feel yourself back

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:21.884 align:middle line:10%
into this room and
open your eyes.

01:05:21.884 --> 01:05:30.280 align:middle line:90%


01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.400 align:middle line:10%
Stretch.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:35.680 align:middle line:10%
And if you have water,
take a chug of your water.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.690 align:middle line:90%


01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, I said to you that
after I came back--

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:53.350 align:middle line:84%
after I went home
from the hospital,

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
that's actually when
the real work began.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And I started
talking to my friends

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
about what I had experienced
on the other side.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
I shared my story, much
like I shared with you--

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:10.450 align:middle line:84%
that we are so much more
than physical beings,

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that we are just the
tip of the iceberg,

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
that we're all connected,
and it was fear

01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:18.670 align:middle line:84%
that I felt that
was making me small

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and suppressing my energy, which
is why the cancer had manifest.

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:25.360 align:middle line:90%
And I was talking to them--

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.290 align:middle line:84%
not just my friends,
but other people,

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:29.450 align:middle line:84%
even people in the
medical community.

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:31.600 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to understand
more what had happened,

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.630 align:middle line:84%
because oncologists
said what had

01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:36.190 align:middle line:90%
happened to me was impossible.

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
But they had the medical
records to prove it.

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
it was impossible

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.420 align:middle line:84%
for billions of cancer cells
to leave my body so fast,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.990 align:middle line:84%
especially because
my body was so weak

01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and because my
organs had shut down.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And so they couldn't explain it.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.380 align:middle line:84%
So when I would explain
it in my own words,

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
they were like, no, no,
no, no, that stuff was just

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:01.200 align:middle line:84%
your dying brain giving
you all these images.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.040 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
understand the physical.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, that is the point.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The physical is a reflection
of the non-physical.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But of course, people were
not quite with me on that.

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
So I was being challenged.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And even friends
of mine were like--

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
because I started
to say, oh, yeah,

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.200 align:middle line:84%
you can't approach
illness with fear.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Their focus is on fear.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.590 align:middle line:90%
We got to love ourselves.

01:07:26.590 --> 01:07:30.550 align:middle line:90%
If you imagine that you were--

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
if you imagined that
you could see energy--

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
imagine if you could
see energy in your body.

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.050 align:middle line:84%
When your energy
is at its highest

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:41.200 align:middle line:84%
is when you love your life,
when you love yourself,

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
when you're passionate
about life, when you don't

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:47.050 align:middle line:84%
have burdens on your shoulders,
when you're being who you are.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, that energy is
what keeps you healthy.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
When you are in that energy
for prolonged periods of time,

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
you start to heal.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in
this energy of shrunken,

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.730 align:middle line:84%
small, fear,
depression, hate myself,

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.700 align:middle line:84%
pleasing people, doormat,
blah, blah, blah, blah--

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:08.380 align:middle line:84%
then of course,
illnesses are going

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.320 align:middle line:84%
to start to manifest,
because you're suppressing

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.240 align:middle line:90%
your own life force energy.

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So imagine if you
could see your energy.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if you could see
what activities increased

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:24.290 align:middle line:84%
your energies and what
activities or what things you

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%
say--

01:08:25.090 --> 01:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
like, when I say "yes"
when I mean "no"--

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
imagine if you could immediately
see your energy diminish.

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you could
see your energy,

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.200 align:middle line:84%
you would make
different choices,

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
because you would have
this understanding

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.279 align:middle line:84%
that if my energy is up and
out and big all the time,

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:44.090 align:middle line:90%
there is no room for illness.

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:47.479 align:middle line:84%
And so you would do things
that would feed your energy.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:49.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you do things
that feed your energy,

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
that's the energy you're
taking out into the world

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
and sharing with
everyone else, which

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
is why when you love yourself,
you're actually selfless,

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
because you're sharing that
love with everyone else.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.319 align:middle line:84%
When you don't love
yourself and you're

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
depressed and everything,
what are you doing?

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.189 align:middle line:84%
You're drawing on
everyone else's energy.

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:12.279 align:middle line:84%
So when we are taught that
it's selfish to love ourselves,

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:15.490 align:middle line:84%
actually we're selfish when
we don't love ourselves,

01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:19.010 align:middle line:84%
because we're dependent on other
people's energies to feed us.

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.319 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
When you do love
yourself, you expand,

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
and you have energy,
which you bring with you.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So who would you rather sit
next to-- someone who loved

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
themselves or
someone who didn't?

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's more selfish
not to love yourself.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I was sharing this.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.289 align:middle line:84%
And people were telling
me, oh, you're delusional.

01:09:41.289 --> 01:09:42.729 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:42.729 --> 01:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah, but
it's what I learned.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.189 align:middle line:84%
But I thought people
would be interested.

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:52.569 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt that,
no, you're not realistic.

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
You still have to go for the
conventional medical stuff.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.718 align:middle line:90%
And you still need all--

01:09:59.718 --> 01:10:00.760 align:middle line:90%
you've got to be careful.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.190 align:middle line:90%
You had cancer.

01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:03.250 align:middle line:90%
You better be careful.

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.660 align:middle line:84%
You better go for
all your tests.

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.460 align:middle line:90%
You better do this.

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:06.830 align:middle line:90%
You better do that.

01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't going back into
that fear-based world,

01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
fear-based world where

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
you feel you've got to do this,
or the cancer will come back.

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
I tell people who've
had illnesses before,

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I want you to focus on
your purpose for life.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to focus on your
passion, your joy, your love,

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
who you love, loving
yourself, learning more about

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
who am I. That's what I had
to discover when I came back--

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
who am I, really?

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I never
discovered that before.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
things you focus on.

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Don't focus on, oh, I'm worried
I'm going to get cancer again,

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.970 align:middle line:84%
because even when you think
you're doing everything

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
to prevent "cancer," all you're
doing is focusing on cancer.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:52.840 align:middle line:90%
It's not a real disease.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
And I know that's provocative.

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.405 align:middle line:90%
I've said that in public before.

01:10:56.405 --> 01:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, people
will slander it.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
But I will say it here,
that cancer is not

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.380 align:middle line:90%
a physical disease.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a metaphysical disease.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I realized that
I had to isolate myself

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%
from that fear-based community.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:18.480 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Thank god, my husband
who was with me

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.320 align:middle line:90%
through the whole journey--

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%
we both transformed together.

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:27.720 align:middle line:84%
And so he knew he couldn't live
in that fear-based community,

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
either, because we had
experienced something which

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:34.020 align:middle line:90%
even science didn't understand.

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.060 align:middle line:90%
So we moved.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.910 align:middle line:84%
We moved to a neighborhood
where nobody knew us.

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was only after, I
was able to really discover

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
who I am in a neighborhood
where I felt safe,

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
because nobody knew me.

01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
There was no expectation
of who I used to be.

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you don't allow
yourself to be who you are,

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the message you are
sending yourself

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
is that I am not a
good person, so I

01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.940 align:middle line:84%
have to control who I am
and try to be someone else.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.020 align:middle line:84%
That's actually not true,
because who you are underneath

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness, love, God.

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.090 align:middle line:90%
That's who you are.

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:14.640 align:middle line:90%
How dare you suppress that?

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.910 align:middle line:84%
When you think about it,
how dare you suppress that?

01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:19.470 align:middle line:90%
That is your essence.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to
discover and started

01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:26.220 align:middle line:84%
to go inward and started
to discover who I am,

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:28.890 align:middle line:90%
my life started to change.

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get out
and heal people.

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But I was really
careful where I went.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
to discover that this

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:38.160 align:middle line:90%
is what I wanted to do.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote about
it on a website.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.640 align:middle line:90%
I wrote about my NDE.

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I signed it just
"Anita M's NDE--

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Anita M's Near-Death Experience.

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Unbeknownst to me, it
started to go viral.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And then it was discovered by
the late, great Dr. Wayne Dyer.

01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
He discovered it
on the internet.

01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And he took it to
his publishers.

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.980 align:middle line:90%
He told them, track her down.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:06.130 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.030 align:middle line:90%
She agrees.

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
She agrees with me.

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.800 align:middle line:90%
She's like, Wayne did that.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Wayne Dyer did that.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.060 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.900 align:middle line:90%
He's in the room.

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.720 align:middle line:90%


01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
The doggy can sense
Wayne in the room.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.900 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Yep, he or she sees Wayne.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.020 align:middle line:90%
What a cute dog.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:32.850 align:middle line:90%
She's so cute.

01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:34.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's me with the dog.

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So Wayne Dyer contacted me
and had Hay House contact me.

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.320 align:middle line:90%
And they tracked me down.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, I had
been reluctant to speak

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.380 align:middle line:90%
about my story.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.720 align:middle line:84%
One day, a friend of mine
asked me to share my story

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.130 align:middle line:90%
in a healing group.

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And after I shared it
with the healing group

01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
and I saw how they
were affected by it,

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.970 align:middle line:90%
I realized that is my purpose.

01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.240 align:middle line:90%
My purpose is to share my story.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.590 align:middle line:84%
The very next day was the day
that I got an email from Hay

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.650 align:middle line:84%
House, saying, Wayne Dyer
discovered your story

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:20.700 align:middle line:84%
on the internet and has
asked us to track you down.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'd never communicated
with Hay House before.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd never communicated
with Wayne Dyer before.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
It was the first I
was hearing of it.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said that
we want to ask you

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:38.220 align:middle line:84%
if you would like to write
a book of your story, which

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer would like to
write the foreword to.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:45.930 align:middle line:90%
I was like, would I?

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
Who gets a book deal in an
email, just handed to them?

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So they said, Wayne
Dyer would like

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:51.720 align:middle line:90%
to write the foreword to it.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And he would like to share
it with his entire audience.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:58.390 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, whoa.

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
I started crying when
I got that email.

01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:04.260 align:middle line:90%
And so of course, I said, yes.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote back, and I
said, oh, my god, what

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.100 align:middle line:90%
do I have to do?

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So they said, we'll send
you a book contract,

01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and you just have to sign it.

01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:13.800 align:middle line:90%
I was living in Hong Kong.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.230 align:middle line:90%
I signed the contract.

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Hay House flew me to the US.

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:19.950 align:middle line:90%
I appeared on stage with Wayne.

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:25.590 align:middle line:84%
He pulled me on stage in front
of an audience of 3,000 people.

01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And there was live streaming
for another two million.

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first
time I was on stage.

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I was sitting in
the audience, in the front.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.992 align:middle line:90%
And he starts to share my story.

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and
there's this woman

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
in Hong Kong who died,
and then tells them

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:43.470 align:middle line:90%
about cancer that healed.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And then he says,
but she's here,

01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:47.920 align:middle line:84%
so let me get her
to share it herself.

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was shaking.

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And he pulled me up on stage.

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And he hands me the mic.

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And he says, go on,
share your story.

01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So there I was in
front of 3,000 people.

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was really shaking.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:03.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said, are you scared?

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.980 align:middle line:90%
He was really incredulous.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.750 align:middle line:90%
He was like, are you scared?

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said, of course I am.

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
I haven't spoken in front
of 3,000 people before.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've
been dead and back.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.780 align:middle line:84%
What have you got
to be scared about?

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And I actually said
to him, it's easier

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:21.270 align:middle line:90%
being dead than public speaking.

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:24.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And that's true.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:33.270 align:middle line:84%
But thanks to Wayne, my
book, "Dying to Be Me"--

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:34.890 align:middle line:90%
he brought me on a TV show.

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:37.380 align:middle line:90%
And it hit the New York Times.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And then it got published in 45
languages, which was amazing.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is,
what I discovered

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:52.470 align:middle line:84%
later was that it took Hay House
five months to track me down,

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:54.570 align:middle line:90%
because I was in Hong Kong.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:57.300 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't even put my
full name to the story,

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.460 align:middle line:84%
because I wasn't sure
I wanted everyone

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.360 align:middle line:90%
to know that it was me.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But having said that, the
day that they found me

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
was the day that I knew
that my purpose was

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:13.510 align:middle line:90%
to share my story, to the day.

01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:16.710 align:middle line:84%
It was like, the night I
realized, this is my purpose,

01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:18.360 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm
meant to be doing--

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the next morning, the
email landed in my mailbox.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
So my point is, I said
we are all connected.

01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:30.330 align:middle line:84%
When you are ready for
something, it comes to you.

01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
go out and chase it.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It comes to you.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.360 align:middle line:84%
You just have to
be ready for it.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the years have gone
on and I'm living this life

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
post-NDE, where I feel
I have created my life--

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:47.580 align:middle line:90%
pre-NDE, I was reacting to life.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:50.760 align:middle line:90%
Post-NDE, I'm creating my life.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Those same old friends
that said I was delusional,

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
they're back in my life.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh, my
god, I love your life.

01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I want what you have.

01:17:57.930 --> 01:17:59.730 align:middle line:90%
How do I do what you do?

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I guess you
got to be delusional.

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:03.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:07.110 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:08.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
So stay on your unicorn.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:16.470 align:middle line:90%
And just follow your dreams.

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:17.820 align:middle line:90%
And don't chase them.

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:21.348 align:middle line:84%
Every time you feel you have
to chase and pursue and fight,

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:22.890 align:middle line:84%
you're just telling
yourself-- you're

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
sending the message that I'm
not good enough for this.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.640 align:middle line:84%
You need to feel it
from the inside--

01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
from the inside-out,
from the inside-out.

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Illness, as well-- the physical
is the last place anything

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.930 align:middle line:90%
shows up.

01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:41.880 align:middle line:90%
It starts from the inside.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.262 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to go into
a couple of questions.

01:18:44.262 --> 01:18:45.970 align:middle line:84%
I know a couple of
people have questions.

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:50.400 align:middle line:10%
But before I do, I created
a near-death experience

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.930 align:middle line:10%
meditation CD.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to give them out
to two people, any two people.

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
throw one on each side.

01:18:58.830 --> 01:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had 500.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%
Oop.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Oops.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
See, and I was
throwing it that way.

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.900 align:middle line:90%
See, you were meant to get it.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.050 align:middle line:90%
One on this side.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:10.930 align:middle line:10%
Oops.

01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I am so sorry.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:14.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
So that meditation
CD, I'm so thrilled.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:21.220 align:middle line:84%
We put it out on 2nd of
February, like, a week ago,

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.190 align:middle line:90%
which is--

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.360 align:middle line:84%
no, two weeks, three
weeks ago, because that

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.730 align:middle line:90%
is the anniversary of my NDE.

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:29.490 align:middle line:90%
And it hit the billboard charts.

01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.360 align:middle line:90%
It hit number 2.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
We were so happy.

01:19:31.330 --> 01:19:34.620 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.560 align:middle line:10%
For anyone who's
interested, also, I

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:40.050 align:middle line:10%
do a lot of retreats
and events where

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:43.260 align:middle line:10%
we like to take people
into that space of feeling

01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.910 align:middle line:10%
like they are expanded.

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:48.030 align:middle line:10%
And we keep you in that space
for the entire duration.

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing a cruise in June--

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:53.850 align:middle line:10%
an Alaska cruise, where we
get to see real icebergs.

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
So if anyone wants
to join me, we've

01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:58.350 align:middle line:84%
left a flyer on
the chair for you.

01:19:58.350 --> 01:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So I would love it if
you guys joined me.

01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:03.990 align:middle line:10%
It's seven days of
lectures and fun

01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:06.010 align:middle line:10%
and tours and stuff like that.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think I have time
for, like, two questions.

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:11.940 align:middle line:90%
Anybody?

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You had a question
from the beginning,

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:15.730 align:middle line:90%
so I'll let you go first.

01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:17.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, wait for-- yeah,
there's a microphone there.

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Yes, if you have a
question, there's

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.930 align:middle line:90%
a microphone right there.

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:24.730 align:middle line:90%
I didn't realize.

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, please.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.890 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I also had a
afterlife experience.

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
curious what you seen?

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I seen a amber
energy, amber light.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies were reddish orange,
and everything else was yellow.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And I saw my friends.

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And I still saw the
shape of their body,

01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:57.210 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't actually see--

01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see any form, their
facial features, or anything

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:01.530 align:middle line:90%
like that.

01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly it.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't see their
facial features.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.870 align:middle line:90%
But you kind of see their form.

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know from their
essence that it's them.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And also, there was
a lot of clarity.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of what I
could see, the colors

01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.130 align:middle line:90%
were clearer than here.

01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:20.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was like wherever
I put my awareness, that's

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:21.900 align:middle line:90%
where I was.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%
A metaphor that I often use--

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.030 align:middle line:84%
it was like I could see
everything all at once.

01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you watch my TED
Talk, you'll see this.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And I've even got it in my book.

01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:35.340 align:middle line:84%
A metaphor I use
is the warehouse.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It's as if you've
spent your whole life

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
in a darkened warehouse
with one little flashlight.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And everything
you've ever seen is

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
just what your little
flashlight has shone on.

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.670 align:middle line:84%
So you can only see
one thing at a time.

01:21:51.670 --> 01:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
One day, the flood lights go on.

01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that you're in
this huge warehouse with lots

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and lots of things-- many
things you've never seen before,

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because your flashlight
never shone on it.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
felt like in my NDE.

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was
aware that everything

01:22:07.770 --> 01:22:09.880 align:middle line:90%
existed simultaneously.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I was aware, from
that perspective, looking down

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
on physical life,
that on this life--

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.130 align:middle line:84%
the bad, the good, the negative,
the positive-- everything

01:22:20.130 --> 01:22:21.810 align:middle line:90%
exists simultaneously.

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:25.410 align:middle line:84%
But what we experience is
what we shine our light on.

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So for example, dark and
light-- fear and love.

01:22:29.190 --> 01:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
All of this exists
simultaneously.

01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:35.040 align:middle line:84%
But it depends what
we shine our light on.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And people seem to believe that
where their light is focused--

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:42.990 align:middle line:84%
when the warehouse is dark
and you can't see anything

01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:45.360 align:middle line:84%
except what your
flashlight is shining on,

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
you think that's all
there is to life.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.360 align:middle line:84%
So if your light
is shining on fear,

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
you think, wow, life
is fearful, when

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:58.380 align:middle line:84%
you don't realize that love and
joy and passion also all exist.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So what I always tell
people, the flashlight

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:04.980 align:middle line:84%
is the analogy of our
awareness while we're here.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you're there,
you become aware

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:08.220 align:middle line:90%
of the whole thing.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And over here, our awareness is
only focused on a little piece.

01:23:12.610 --> 01:23:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And just real quickly,
I want to try something

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.740 align:middle line:90%
that I did before.

01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
For those of you who've not
watched my TED Talk or heard me

01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:24.660 align:middle line:84%
speak before, I want you to
look around the room and find

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
everything in the room
that is red in color--

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:32.790 align:middle line:84%
any family of red,
red-orange, dark red--

01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:34.470 align:middle line:90%
and commit it to your memory.

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Anything in the room--
look around, look around.

01:23:36.900 --> 01:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Commit it to your memory.

01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
test you in a minute.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:43.320 align:middle line:90%
So face the front.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Now face the front.

01:23:44.730 --> 01:23:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.730 align:middle line:90%
No peeking.

01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to
recollect everything

01:23:50.370 --> 01:23:52.552 align:middle line:90%
in the room that's blue.

01:23:52.552 --> 01:23:56.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

01:23:58.400 --> 01:23:59.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So now open your
eyes, and look around.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Look around at what you missed.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
You're probably wearing
something yourself

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:11.440 align:middle line:84%
that you forgot that's
blue-- your own shirt.

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing--
from where I'm standing,

01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:15.940 align:middle line:84%
there's more blue in
the room than red.

01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Your flashlight
was focused on red.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
But there's more blue
in the room than red.

01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:22.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what we do with fear.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Fear sells.

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So people will keep
feeding you fear.

01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.000 align:middle line:84%
As long as you keep
your awareness--

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.060 align:middle line:84%
your flashlight--
focused on fear,

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:33.250 align:middle line:84%
that will be your
experience of the world.

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And you will completely
miss the joy, passion, love,

01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:39.332 align:middle line:84%
of which there is
more of in the world.

01:24:39.332 --> 01:24:41.040 align:middle line:84%
So that was the reason
for that exercise.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.984 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:41.984 --> 01:24:42.928 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:24:42.928 --> 01:24:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:24:45.290 --> 01:24:49.690 align:middle line:90%
And let's do one more question.

01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:51.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes, come on up to the mic.

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.880 align:middle line:90%


01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.600 align:middle line:84%
>> They call me Mr.
Red, by the way.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.682 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

01:25:02.682 --> 01:25:03.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I have a question for you.

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:05.682 align:middle line:84%
I've heard the thing
about loving yourself.

01:25:05.682 --> 01:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And I never got the
proper definition.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain,
how do you love--

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.580 align:middle line:90%
how do you love yourself?

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you buy a lot
of expensive things

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:15.380 align:middle line:90%
or buy things for people?

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.990 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted to ask you.

01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:18.590 align:middle line:90%
I've heard about, love yourself.

01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:20.840 align:middle line:84%
But I've never found
out, how do you do it?

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Great question.

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Mr. Red.

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:27.140 align:middle line:90%


01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:28.280 align:middle line:90%
So there's many ways.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, it's
to love your whole self.

01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:33.290 align:middle line:84%
I like buying
expensive things, too.

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:35.275 align:middle line:84%
But I like it when
people give me--

01:25:35.275 --> 01:25:36.900 align:middle line:84%
but anyway, that's
a whole other thing.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
So loving yourself does not--

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm kidding.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Loving yourself does not
mean buying expensive things.

01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:44.890 align:middle line:90%
But you can.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.690 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
When you don't love
yourself, you actually

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.630 align:middle line:84%
do things to
compensate, like buying

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
yourself expensive
things, trying to keep up

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:56.080 align:middle line:90%
with fashion, and all.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
When you love
yourself, you actually

01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:00.190 align:middle line:90%
lose interest in those things.

01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:02.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what I
actually want to say.

01:26:02.380 --> 01:26:06.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you love yourself,
you're unafraid to say no.

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.900 align:middle line:90%
You're unafraid to say no.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:11.860 align:middle line:84%
You're unafraid
to honor yourself.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:13.360 align:middle line:90%
You put your health first--

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.430 align:middle line:84%
your well-being,
sorry, not health--

01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
your well-being
before anything else.

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
When you don't
love yourself, you

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:22.690 align:middle line:90%
fear not having enough money.

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
You say yes to things
for the sake of money,

01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:28.450 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to for the
sake of well-being.

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you're in a job you hate,

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.400 align:middle line:84%
it means you don't
love yourself enough.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
If you're in an
abusive relationship

01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:37.570 align:middle line:84%
but you're too
afraid to get out,

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
it means you don't
love yourself enough.

01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You're not giving yourself
the same priority that you're

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.080 align:middle line:90%
giving other people.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
If you fall flat on
your face and fail

01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and you judge yourself
and beat yourself

01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:50.380 align:middle line:84%
up more than anyone
else does, that

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.360 align:middle line:84%
means you don't love
yourself enough.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.520 align:middle line:84%
So those are examples
of not loving yourself.

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.200 align:middle line:84%
When you love
yourself, you realize

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.960 align:middle line:84%
you are much more than
your physical being.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
You realize you have
a greater purpose.

01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And you put your
well-being-- your health--

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:09.690 align:middle line:84%
you realize you are an
expression of the divine,

01:27:09.690 --> 01:27:11.080 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.690 align:middle line:90%
And that is a priority to you--

01:27:13.690 --> 01:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
to be that channel, to be
that vessel for the divine

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.420 align:middle line:90%
to express itself through you.

01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And in order for the divine
to express itself through you,

01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
you do whatever it takes
to be that channel.

01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And if it means sometimes
spending more money on things,

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:35.680 align:middle line:84%
or if it means sitting in first
class for your well-being,

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:37.420 align:middle line:84%
you do that, because
your well-being

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.930 align:middle line:90%
is the most important thing.

01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But you do it for different
reasons than someone

01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:45.930 align:middle line:84%
who is just trying to compensate
for not loving themselves.

01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And for me, the big one
that I learned was I

01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
realized that I was doing
things for the wrong reasons.

01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I was doing things because I was
afraid of disappointing people.

01:27:58.450 --> 01:27:59.920 align:middle line:90%
That was the big one for me.

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the big one
about loving myself

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
was learning to say no.

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:07.150 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that
clarified somewhat.

01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:10.165 align:middle line:90%
Let's do one last one, I think.

01:28:10.165 --> 01:28:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just curious
about one thing--

01:28:13.150 --> 01:28:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They can't hear you.

01:28:14.290 --> 01:28:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They can't hear you.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just a
snippet to what--

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:17.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all right.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.493 align:middle line:90%
We want to hear you.

01:28:18.493 --> 01:28:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's possible
that it's a practice?

01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not just getting
in that right place

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:25.020 align:middle line:84%
or buying the first
class, but it's really

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
maybe a practice that's a daily
sort of practice to love self

01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to get into that
place more often?

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It is a practice.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So first, there has
to be that insight.

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:41.720 align:middle line:84%
There has to be the
insight, the desire.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:43.550 align:middle line:90%
That has to come first.

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:45.980 align:middle line:90%
But it does take time.

01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:47.600 align:middle line:90%
And you know why it takes time?

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Because we've built a habit.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:53.150 align:middle line:84%
We've made a habit of
putting ourselves last.

01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to kind
of undo that habit.

01:28:56.210 --> 01:28:57.560 align:middle line:90%
We have to become aware.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you're
putting yourself last,

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
you have to become aware
that, oh, I'm doing it again,

01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:04.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting myself last again.

01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
We really have to
become aware of that.

01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:08.720 align:middle line:84%
How many people
here have trouble

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
saying no when you really
don't want to do something?

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:13.640 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So here's something I
want you to remember.

01:29:17.630 --> 01:29:19.790 align:middle line:84%
When you say yes
because you're just

01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:22.700 align:middle line:84%
afraid of disappointing
someone, now

01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.620 align:middle line:90%
imagine-- just imagine this.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if everything that
everyone has ever done for you,

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:32.720 align:middle line:84%
they've done it because they're
afraid if they don't do it,

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.510 align:middle line:90%
they'll disappoint you.

01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:35.310 align:middle line:90%
Imagine.

01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:36.750 align:middle line:90%
How does that feel?

01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:38.990 align:middle line:84%
How does that feel
if people have--

01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:41.780 align:middle line:84%
everyone that's said
yes to you, have said it

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.540 align:middle line:84%
because they're
afraid of saying no,

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:47.730 align:middle line:84%
not because they really
want to do it for you,

01:29:47.730 --> 01:29:50.210 align:middle line:84%
but because they're
afraid of saying no.

01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't you wish that they
would rather have been honest?

01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:55.400 align:middle line:90%
You do, right?

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.710 align:middle line:90%
That's where the dissonance is.

01:29:57.710 --> 01:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
We don't like the feeling
of someone doing it to us.

01:30:00.860 --> 01:30:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But we do it to other
people and think

01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:04.910 align:middle line:90%
we're good people for doing it.

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:08.210 align:middle line:84%
We think that, oh, I'm
too nice to say no.

01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:09.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a dissonance.

01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the dissonance that
gets you to become inauthentic.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the trap.

01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.040 align:middle line:90%
So remember that.

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Remember that.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Treat other people the way
you want to be treated.

01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:23.480 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget,
love yourself first.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:27.385 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want other
people to be honest with you

01:30:27.385 --> 01:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and say no to you
when they don't

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:32.130 align:middle line:84%
feel like doing something,
do that for them, as well.

01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So thank you all for
coming this morning.

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I so appreciate you.

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:39.520 align:middle line:90%
