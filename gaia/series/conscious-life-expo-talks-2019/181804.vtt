00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So get ready to be amazed,
be dazzled, and intrigued,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.290 align:middle line:90%
and inspired.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.820 align:middle line:84%
And I guarantee
you, once you hear

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:84%
this story, one
hell of a journey,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
you may be scratching
your head, and you

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:90%
will be smiling for sure.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.933 align:middle line:84%
You'll be laughing and
you will be touched.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:84%
But most of all,
you'll be saying,

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.150 align:middle line:90%
thank you, Mr. Rocket Man.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let me finally introduce

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
the man that really
wants to tell you

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:90%
this story, David Adair.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.766 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Alexis.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I get so embarrassed when
people talk like that around me.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, she's right.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I've lived all these stories.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.880 align:middle line:90%
And just like I told critics--

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.173 align:middle line:84%
you know, one critic
told me, he said,

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to say mad at you.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%
You're so damn nice.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you mad at us?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:90%
I said, not at all.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
If I heard my stories from me,
I wouldn't believe them either.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And I've lived them.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And I still don't believe it.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The thing about it, though,
the stories have not stopped.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's still going.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
That's something I'll tell
you in a little bit here.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's all the wild,
crazy stuff I've been doing.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.230 align:middle line:84%
It's about to ratchet up
about five times that amount

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.772 align:middle line:90%
is what's about to happen next.

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me go
ahead and tell you.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
In April, this coming
April, I'll be on my way

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:90%
to the Middle East.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:84%
You know, you live
in such a bubble.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You realize that the
Middle East is no longer

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
a bunch of countries, where
you have Saudi Arabia,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.558 align:middle line:84%
and you've got
Jordan, Egypt, Syria.

00:01:55.558 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
They're not all separate
countries anymore.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
They have formed together like
the United States of America.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.340 align:middle line:84%
Now it's called the
United Emirates.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of those countries
now function as one unit,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's changing the
entire outlook of everything.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's caused a number
of things to happen.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
For instance, did you know
that the Middle East now

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.330 align:middle line:90%
has its own space program?

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%
In December, anybody notice
that Saudi Arabia launched

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.730 align:middle line:90%
a satellite into space?

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, they did.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't get much
on the national news.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't care for
Trump that much,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.870 align:middle line:90%
but he's right about fake news.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.180 align:middle line:84%
You just don't get what's
going on out there.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians launched
the satellite.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Saudi Arabia was in charge.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.315 align:middle line:84%
They got the country Japan
to build the satellite

00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and launch it for them, and
it's replacing the CIA satellite

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:57.308 align:middle line:90%
they're using.

00:02:57.308 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
So they're developing
their own set of satellites

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:90%
like the CIA has.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:90%
But that's just the start.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.620 align:middle line:90%
They're just cranking up.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I get an email
from Serena Wright Taylor,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
who works at the
expo here, and she

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:90%
was contacted by this group.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And she said, David,
I think these people--

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:84%
you really might
want to talk to them.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the email
and I went, are you serious?

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:90%
I get so many offers--

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:90%
dozens and dozens every year.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
People want to give me a
billion dollars to do this,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
finish that, and none of it's
real and I just blow it off.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought this was another one.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:90%
I was wrong on that one.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:84%
These people said, we'd like
to fund all your projects.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:90%
And I went, yeah?

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can think of one
of the very first projects,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.220 align:middle line:90%
it'll be about $150 billion.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.190 align:middle line:84%
That's with a B.
And they went, yeah,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.720 align:middle line:84%
where do you want
the funds sent?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- so I said,
oh, man, wait a minute.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Let me come over and visit you.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we're--

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
in April, I will
go there and visit.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But I said, well, what
else do you want me to do?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And they started running
their grocery list,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's every project
I've ever designed.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know, you're
going to be in trillions,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to
make quintillions out

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
of it, which is the figure
of money they use now.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.725 align:middle line:90%
That's $100 trillion.

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
They've more money-- if you
would take the combined wealth

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
of America, the Soviet Union,
and China-- the big three--

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
and add it up, they have a
million times more than that.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I embarrassed them
when I talked to them.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I said, what about
your grandsons?

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
They went-- the King is
going, what about them?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
I said-- what are
you referring to?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:90%
Their cars?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:84%
They took two big
Mercedes 550 SLEs

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and glued half a billion
dollar diamonds on each one

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:90%
so they can drive around.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know there's
better ways to spend money,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And they said, yeah, that's what
we want to talk to you about.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, what
do you want to do?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, start
with, like, come over

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:90%
here and run the space program.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.953 align:middle line:90%
That sounds cool.

00:05:42.953 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to do-- what
programs do you want to do?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:90%
The ones you want to do.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:84%
First thing I'd do is I'm
going back to the moon.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you hadn't heard, two
days ago, what did Israel do?

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:84%
They launched a
spacecraft to the moon.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's going to soft
impact on March 12.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:84%
All it's going to do is
just land, and that's it.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:90%
They want two things out of it--

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
The Apollo effect,
which is where everybody

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
gets excited to go back to
the moon; and the other one

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:84%
was to prove that a
private company could

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.217 align:middle line:84%
land a probe on the moon, which
when that thing sets down,

00:06:21.217 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:90%
it will be the first to do that.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%
So they got their goals.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've got two goals, and
they're a little bit different.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
First thing I would do is
send my fleet to the moon.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
There'll be 12 of them, and
they're very specialized AI

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:90%
robots.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know where
we're going to land?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
NASA launched the
Israeli spacecraft out

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:90%
of Cape Canaveral.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
We're not launching
out of Cape Canaveral.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.670 align:middle line:90%
We're going to launch--

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:84%
when I get everything
prepped down there--

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
they've just got a million acres
in the center of the Congo,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Africa.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Here's more real news
y'all don't know about.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember-- you've
probably vaguely heard things

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
like Mandela, apartheids.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.505 align:middle line:84%
Well, they've got a
racism problem down there

00:07:16.505 --> 00:07:19.250 align:middle line:90%
that pales compared to America.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And all the native
chiefs have formed now

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
a thing called
the African Union.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And the African Union's
just joined the group

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.290 align:middle line:90%
that I'm joining.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, they
wouldn't want to help us

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.960 align:middle line:90%
with-- what do you need?

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'd like to have a
couple acres in the Congo.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Said, we've got a million.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.070 align:middle line:84%
You know what runs through
the center of the property?

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:90%
The equator.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
You know what I
can do with that?

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
When I launch a space probe out
of the center of the equator--

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
NASA charges $10,000
per pound into orbit

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.270 align:middle line:84%
because they're about 4,000
miles north of the equator.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is spinning.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
So remember when we used to
play on a merry go round,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.565 align:middle line:84%
and someone might stick
their arm out and grab you,

00:08:09.565 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and you go really flying
and go swinging off?

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what the earth
will do with the spacecraft.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't pay $10,000 a pound.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.120 align:middle line:90%
I pay $100.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Think I'm going to
make some money?

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:84%
No one has ever
launched a spacecraft

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:84%
from the equator
as of this moment.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Not one single person or nation.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.870 align:middle line:90%
Which I don't know why that is.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.919 align:middle line:84%
I guess because the
area is so remote.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Plus the natives in Africa
had a tendency to throw

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:84%
spears in you because
they don't like--

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.899 align:middle line:84%
and I said, now that we're
talking about that, how

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
do you guys feel about this bald
headed white dude coming down

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:84%
there and starting launching
rockets into space?

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
anything in the ground.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't want--

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want
a blade of grass.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:84%
See, Africa is an
undeveloped nation,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
but it has more resources than
the entire world combined.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.065 align:middle line:84%
They've got tons of nickel,
zinc, chromium, diamonds.

00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:10.435 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And everybody comes down there,
they want to dig in the ground.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't want
to dig in the ground.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to put some
concrete over top of it

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and shoot these
rockets in space.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.700 align:middle line:90%
So the African Union went, cool.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Come on down and shoot them.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.100 align:middle line:90%
We'll watch.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So I can just imagine
I'm down there launching,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got all these
big bleachers,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and all these natives sitting
with spears, and feathers,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and stuff watching
the rocket go.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you can't
make up stuff like this.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to
be happening, y'all.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
You've seen the big push lately,
trying to become a space faring

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.867 align:middle line:90%
nation.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine I'm sitting
in the middle of the equator

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.640 align:middle line:90%
with a spaceport?

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
I'm going to do?

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be business.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
So they liked all that.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I do is
fire about 12 of them off

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%
and we go to the moon.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Where we going?

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
NASA put the Israeli
space probe down

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:84%
in Marinus C, which is just like
a big open flat piece of land.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the bottom
of the ocean floor.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.520 align:middle line:90%
You know where I'm going?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed a little video
tape that said moon bases

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and I watched it
and I took notes.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to land at all 12
sites of those weird things

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.670 align:middle line:90%
we've heard about.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
So some of you hadn't seen--

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.970 align:middle line:90%
I suggest you see it.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a tower out there
that stands miles high.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what that is.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:53.577 align:middle line:90%
I want to go find out.

00:10:53.577 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even going to speculate.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But the material does not look
indigenous to the moon at all.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an arch out
there that's-- you know the St.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Louis arch?

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, this thing's
about 25 times the size

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:08.410 align:middle line:90%
of the St. Louis arch.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.500 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
It just goes on
and on, the list.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:90%
And these things deserved--

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:90%
when I land, I'll be about--

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:21.283 align:middle line:84%
I want to land about
200 yards away from it.

00:11:21.283 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right on top of it.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
get out and drive away--

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the robots will drive the
weights right on to it.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.187 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a door,
we'll see the door knob.

00:11:31.187 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
find out what it is.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
You think people are
going to watch this?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.240 align:middle line:90%
I told the Arabs, I said--

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:84%
somebody said, pay
for views, David.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:90%
7.5 billion views.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
get some dollars.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, we're
going to give it away.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, OK.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
I said, don't feel
too bad, guys.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.120 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Because you're going to have a
two mile long line of sponsors,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and there'll be a trillion
dollars sitting there.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:84%
They went, we like
the way you think.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.110 align:middle line:90%
So you'll get to see it free.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:90%
And no delays.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Real time.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:84%
Whatever I see, we'll see
together at the same time.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:18.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, I have--

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I could go for hours
on just this subject.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
On all the stuff
we've talked about.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:84%
But just know that some
day in April this month

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.810 align:middle line:84%
that we'll be going to Cairo,
and we'll sit down, negotiate.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't believe all the
other stuff I got going there.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What about the
dark side of the moon?

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.070 align:middle line:90%
>> The what now?

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The dark side of the moon?

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Dark side of the moon.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Well, I have a whole secondary
fleet that goes back there.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And my mother ship
that arrives in orbit--

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
you know, line of
sight signal, so we

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.820 align:middle line:90%
can see whatever is back there.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Man, if this was-- if
the moon was a patient,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
there's not going to be
a hole left unexplored.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to see
what's up there.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:84%
See, I grew up-- my surrogate
mother was Viola Armstrong.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.060 align:middle line:90%
That's Neil's mother.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.348 align:middle line:84%
When Neil was walking
on the moon that night--

00:13:22.348 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:90%
I hate that question at dinner.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.748 align:middle line:90%
It comes up.

00:13:24.748 --> 00:13:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Where were you when Neil
was walking on the moon?

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, oh, god.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.300 align:middle line:90%
You know, I have a choice--

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.530 align:middle line:84%
A, lie that I was sitting at
home just watching it; or B,

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.293 align:middle line:90%
tell the truth.

00:13:36.293 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
When Neil was
walking on the moon,

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm leaning back against
Viola Armstrong's knees,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.900 align:middle line:84%
with her husband Stephen, and
the Mercury Seven astronauts--

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
all seven were on
the floor in front

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:52.885 align:middle line:84%
of me watching on TV in their
home in Wapakoneta, Ohio.

00:13:52.885 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And when Neil was
sleeping on the moon,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.875 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping in his
childhood bed because I--

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
she was like my
surrogate mother.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Stanton Friedman, he
said, no, he didn't know him.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all a lie.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:90%
It never happened.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.080 align:middle line:90%
You know, what a piece of crap.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, I said, really?

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, I made a video over
here with him saying that.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And then as he's saying it,
rolls up my press credentials

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and my security signed by the
head of the security of NASA.

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:90%
How do you Photoshop that?

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Whoops, there, Stanton.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:90%
And he's made several--

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I've caught him in two lies,
and I busted him each time

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.100 align:middle line:90%
on that video.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So you might want to
check out that video.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.313 align:middle line:90%
His health's not doing well.

00:14:44.313 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:84%
I was going to
send him the video,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
but I'm afraid to give
him a heart attack.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's the thing about
people that research me.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:55.810 align:middle line:90%
They say they're researchers.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, how come all my contacts
never heard of these people?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
They never heard of
Stanton Friedman.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:90%
So in that video--

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I made that video for y'all.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether
you believe me or not.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.000 align:middle line:84%
You know that
song, I don't care.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.380 align:middle line:84%
I threw your crap in a bag
and threw it downstairs.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
That's my ringtone on my phone.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:23.773 align:middle line:84%
So I really don't care
because, you know,

00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see those
people standing there

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:84%
with me when I was going
through all this stuff.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.892 align:middle line:84%
But if you want
hardcore documents,

00:15:33.892 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:90%
the film will show it to you.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:90%
For instance, there is--

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
if you would call the probate
judge in Maryville, Tennessee,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.280 align:middle line:90%
he'll pull out the records.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And you ask him,
who was the executor

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
of Colonel Arthur
Bailey Williams,

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
the XO of General LeMay?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And the executor will
say, David Tyson Adair.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:90%
How do you Photoshop that?

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The probate judge
will tell you that.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So that means Colonel
Williams was real

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:90%
and I was his executor.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is-- this
is a good one here.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
The people who were
making the film,

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.880 align:middle line:90%
they were skeptical at first.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
let's have some fun.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So we went to Ashland,
Ohio to the library,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.343 align:middle line:84%
the congressional library,
Congressman John Ashbrook.

00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the Congressman
that helped

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:84%
me build the rocket
I'm going to tell you

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:90%
about in just a minute.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And the camera walks
in, and they walk back

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:84%
with the curator to this big
vault. And they spin the wheel,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.125 align:middle line:84%
and they open the door, and
they bring out this tray,

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:90%
and there's these letters.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:47.628 align:middle line:84%
And the first letter
they lay down,

00:16:47.628 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
the camera goes right to it.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:90%
No breaks.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Right into it.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it says, Dear David,
Congressman Ashbrook's out

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.980 align:middle line:84%
running for President
of the United States.

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And while he's doing that, we're
in the process of obtaining

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:90%
the Titan missile for you.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.890 align:middle line:90%
Stop right there.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
A Titan missile back in 1970.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:90%
That's a state of the art ICBM.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:21.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the most powerful
nuclear warhead we've got--

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
the rocket.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:29.210 align:middle line:84%
It stands 130 feet tall, and it
takes about a 20 man military

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:90%
crew to move it around.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.380 align:middle line:84%
It's got one million
pounds thrusting engines.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:90%
So what's that mean?

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:90%
Look at the date of the letter.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:90%
June 10, 1970.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I was born in 1954.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
How old am I?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm 15 years old.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Congress, with their
letterhead stationery,

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
is handing over state of the
art ICBM to a 15-year-old.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't you find
that a little odd?

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
I remember this cameraman
was looking at it.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.530 align:middle line:84%
All we heard out of
him was, oh, god.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:05.302 align:middle line:84%
And so the producer looked at
it and said, are you kidding?

00:18:05.302 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if you like that
letter, look at the other 13

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
It's my whole story,
told by Congress.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
So Stanton, put that in
your pipe and smoke it.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:18.050 align:middle line:90%
And there's more.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Just documents after document.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
This one document took
me two years to get.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.440 align:middle line:84%
General May went and burnt my
mother's retirement records.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And Stanton Friedman said
my mother was some kind

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
of caregiver for General LeMay.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:90%
Caregiver.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:90%
Bull crap.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
My mother was 41
years old in 1966

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and she just became the first
CC technician, coronary care

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.630 align:middle line:84%
technician, with a
brand new hospital

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
called Rowan Memorial
or Martin Memorial.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And that don't sound
like a big deal?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.330 align:middle line:90%
This 1966, y'all.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the first critical
care unit for hearts.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It's a big thing.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was
the first female

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
to operate the thing
in the state of Ohio.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And she worked night shifts.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:90%
She left at 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:90%
She loved that shift.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, she had a
patient laying there.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.570 align:middle line:84%
His name is Irving LeMay,
and he's 93 years old

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and mean as a snake.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.648 align:middle line:84%
And he knocked her out of one of
my mother's nurses with a cane.

00:19:30.648 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, mother went down
there and grabbed the cane

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.960 align:middle line:84%
and broke it across
his headboard,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and had him by his
neck and told him,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I will beat you to death
if you touch another nurse.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, he became real
friendly with my mother.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
So his son named Curtis LeMay,
four star Air Force General,

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Chief of the Joint Chiefs,
designer of the B-52

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Stratofortress, and
founder of SAC--

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Strategic Air Command-- our
nuclear deterrent resistance

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.045 align:middle line:84%
system that's still
in place today.

00:20:05.045 --> 00:20:06.530 align:middle line:90%
A little important person?

00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:90%
He was mighty important.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:16.340 align:middle line:84%
He had a paparazzi problem
that wouldn't quit in 1970.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Let's see, 1966.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
So he liked coming in at 3:00
in the morning to see his dad,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and he had to go
through my mother.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.505 align:middle line:90%
She's in charge.

00:20:31.505 --> 00:20:34.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And when Curtis found out my
mother took his dad's cane

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
and threatened to beat
him to death with it,

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.360 align:middle line:90%
he really liked my mother.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So they became really good
friends, and Curtis came often,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and he got to know my
mother really well.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't think being an LPN it
makes you a caregiver, Stanton.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Curtis LeMay asked
my mother about her family.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:90%
She says, I've got three sons.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:12.275 align:middle line:84%
Two of them are normal
kids, but that third one,

00:21:12.275 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
you've got to keep
an eye on him.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.810 align:middle line:90%
Something not right about him.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:90%
He goes, why?

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with him?

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You know, drunk driving?

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I wish he was like that.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead, he builds these
rockets and missiles

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and launches them
out of cow fields.

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And Curtis is
going, he does what?

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
And then Curtis asked, does
he write anything down?

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:90%
He's got this big notebook.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So he said, can you
bring it one night?

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So she agreed.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's 11:00 PM
she goes to work.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to bed.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:90%
She takes my notebook.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:47.820 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know about it.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.660 align:middle line:84%
She takes it up there
and LeMay looks at it.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And he asked my mother,
do you have a photocopier?

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So he photocopies
about a third of it,

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and then he heads off to a
place called Battelle Memorial.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
You ever heard of it?

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this audience would.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Battelle Memorial's
a giant think tank.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:84%
In 1966, they had 137 Nobel
laureates on their staff

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.360 align:middle line:90%
in science.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Powerful organization.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:90%
Still there today.

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.450 align:middle line:90%
You want to know a secret?

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:90%
A real one?

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Not BS?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.230 align:middle line:84%
What Battelle Memorial does,
besides being a think tank,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:84%
they manage laboratories
all over the country.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Guess who one of
their clients is?

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Groom Lake.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
That is who manages Area 51.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Come in and blow my brains out.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
you're not going

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to learn from anybody
else in this building.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So they're looking at
all of my formulas.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And LeMay asked them, is
this just chicken scratch,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:90%
or is it something real?

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
and they went,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
who is the person
who's writing this?

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Where are they?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And he said, why?

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Is there something to it?

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:17.770 align:middle line:84%
The person's closing in
on thermonuclear fusion

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:18.890 align:middle line:90%
containment.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:19.690 align:middle line:90%
You mean it's real?

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:20.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Who-- what lab is he in?

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:26.320 align:middle line:84%
It's just some teenager flying
rockets out in a cow field.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.088 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you mean
there's something to it?

00:23:30.088 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, there's some to it.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.590 align:middle line:90%
When can we meet him?

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:84%
So boy, things were never
the same after that.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Cause once LeMay saw
what was happening--

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
this is all my story
of how it's happening.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.570 align:middle line:84%
I was building rockets
out in cow fields.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Four farmers had four farms
that all came together

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:90%
in the center.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They dug out a big earth pit and
they let me launch rockets out.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:90%
This is 1966.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:84%
October, a TV show started
called "Star Trek,"

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and these four farmers
were Star Trekkers.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
What's the odds
of that happening?

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so they let me
have these four farms.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
So I had nearly
1,000 acres of fenced

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.000 align:middle line:84%
off property that could launch
out of and land back in,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and nobody could
mess with my rockets.

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's how everything
started-- evolution up

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:22.840 align:middle line:90%
from there.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:23.860 align:middle line:90%
God, I'm jumping around.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to do this.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.660 align:middle line:90%
It's is like "Pulp Fiction."

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm jumping all over the place.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Let me back all the
way up to Florida.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I was two years old.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Welch,
West Virginia.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:43.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was born a poor
black child in the--

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I did that in Atlanta
to a black church

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.980 align:middle line:84%
called New Hope and 14,000
black people in there.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And the cardinal invited
me in to talk to him

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and he introduced me, all these
immaculate laurels and things

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I've done.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And I stand up, and I
start off with that.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:90%
"I was born a poor black child."

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.540 align:middle line:90%
Steve Martin, "The Jerk"?

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:04.796 align:middle line:90%
And nobody's laughing.

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, oh, god.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.000 align:middle line:84%
So I turn around and look
at the cardinal and went--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:90%
his name's Carl.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
He's actually Carl McNair.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:90%
He's going to shoot me for this.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.105 align:middle line:84%
His brother was Ron
McNair, the black astronaut

00:25:16.105 --> 00:25:17.960 align:middle line:90%
that died on Challenger.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.460 align:middle line:90%
See how it all connects, right?

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.200 align:middle line:90%
I live in that world.

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at Carl and
went, wow, Carl, I've

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
never seen a black
man turn white before.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- and I thought,
still no reaction.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:90%
Just quiet.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
I'm dying here.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And a soprano behind me, big
lady, about three feet across,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
and she just goes [LAUGHING].

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.860 align:middle line:90%
And she just broke out laughing.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Then everybody started laughing.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, god.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.160 align:middle line:90%
I've been saved.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And when I got off the podium,
the cardinal got up and went,

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.920 align:middle line:90%
you're right, Carl.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
One hour and five minutes,
and not one minute in a box.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:84%
He said, that boy's not off the
chain, he done left the yard.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:90%
And it was a lot of fun.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, so I was born
in Welch, West Virginia.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.882 align:middle line:84%
My dad was a
functional illiterate.

00:26:06.882 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't read or write.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.620 align:middle line:84%
My mother taught him
to read and write.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And here I am at age 7, working
quantum physics differential

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:90%
Go figure, y'all.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:20.580 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea why
this is happening.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And one woman entered
my life at that moment.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:90%
It was the librarian, Mrs. Hunt.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.205 align:middle line:84%
And she's looking
at me and she goes,

00:26:29.205 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
why are you sitting in
that corner over there

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:90%
in the 600 section?

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
That's where all the
technical books are.

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.887 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, I'm reading.

00:26:35.887 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
She says, are you
reading those books?

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want to
sound like a smart aleck,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.155 align:middle line:90%
but it came out that--

00:26:41.155 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, there's no
pictures in the books.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.052 align:middle line:90%
She's about 80 years old.

00:26:48.052 --> 00:26:50.010 align:middle line:84%
She goes, how much of
these books you remember?

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Everything in each one.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.137 align:middle line:84%
So she pulls this book out and
she goes, what's in this book?

00:26:56.137 --> 00:26:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It's at the preface.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
What's it say?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it would
help to have the title.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And she went, oh,
fluctuations in singularities.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
you at the preface?

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.520 align:middle line:84%
In a singularity,
when you form, it's

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.900 align:middle line:84%
the death of a collapsing
star, and it will eventually

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
regret back to its
original event horizon.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And she's going--
puts it on the shelf.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.530 align:middle line:90%
So you do remember this stuff.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
How many of these
books have you read?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:90%
All of them.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And she went, are
there other books?

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but we're in
Welch, West Virginia.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get a book in here.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, come back to
the library at 8 o'clock.

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:90%
I want you to meet somebody.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Came back and saw the
librarians having a meeting,

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:47.550 align:middle line:84%
and saw women and girls, and
they made me a librarian.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going, I
don't want to be a librarian.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And she leaned over
to me and she said,

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.510 align:middle line:84%
librarians are allowed
to order any books

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.880 align:middle line:84%
they want, as many as they
want, forever as they work here.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, I want
to be a librarian.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And I learned the
Dewey Decimal system

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:11.160 align:middle line:90%
like you wouldn't believe.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:90%
Index cards.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:13.920 align:middle line:90%
But I started ordering books.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And that little lady had
no idea what a monster

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:90%
she'd turned loose.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've read everything
on planet Earth.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
And I could speed read.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:23.820 align:middle line:90%
And I have an eidetic memory.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I remember everything.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow over
here in the red shirt,

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:84%
I just proved to him I have
an eidetic memory, don't I?

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.060 align:middle line:90%
He sent me an email.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I remembered the time, the
date, and quoted everything

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.010 align:middle line:90%
in that email right back to him.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And he's going, how do
you know that stuff?

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:90%
You emailed me.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Brain just went snap, snap,
snap, and I got it all.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.680 align:middle line:90%
That's rare.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't get to demonstrate
that too much like that.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.408 align:middle line:90%
There's no way to fake that.

00:28:54.408 --> 00:28:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You put me over here and
told me to say all that.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't tell them that.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:01.380 align:middle line:90%
I want my $20 back.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.770 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:84%
You people are a
hoot as audiences go.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot of fun to come
in here and talk to y'all.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.778 align:middle line:84%
I have colleagues ask me
why do I come and talk

00:29:16.778 --> 00:29:18.000 align:middle line:90%
to these groups.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.582 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I go
over there to get educated.

00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And they're looking
at me-- really?

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.840 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%
They know so much.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Stuff you don't think about.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:90%
And I really mean that.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Y'all ask the smartest questions
I've ever heard in my life.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, back to the rockets.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So now I've got all these
books, I've read all this stuff.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.860 align:middle line:84%
Now my brain is
loaded like a gun,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and now I'll start building.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm building
rockets, and I start off

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.290 align:middle line:84%
with whatever I can
find, assemble together.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I was born only three
miles from Coalwood, which

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.840 align:middle line:90%
is the home of Homer Hickam.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.900 align:middle line:90%
"October Sky"?

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:90%
That's Homer.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:90%
We know each other.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We were born three
miles from each other.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.210 align:middle line:90%
Weird, isn't it?

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And in his movie,
"October Sky," you'll

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.240 align:middle line:90%
see an old man in a black suit.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.090 align:middle line:84%
That's his daddy's boss,
the mine superintendent.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:90%
That's my mother's dad.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.830 align:middle line:90%
That's my grandfather.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected, y'all.

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not accidental.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:25.030 align:middle line:90%
It all flows like a river.

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, Homer and
I, when we got together

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:84%
with Chuck Yeager, the guy
who broke the speed barrier,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
he's in the movie
"The Right Stuff."

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
All three of us were
sitting at a table.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We were being indoctrinated
into West Virginia Hall of Fame.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And we all looked at
each other and went--

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I said-- no, as Homer said,
must be something in the water.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, they were
fun to hang out with.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I will tell you
one private joke.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Chuck Yeager said-- he asked
me a question, real serious.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
David, what do you call a
cow that's had an abortion?

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:03.720 align:middle line:90%
What, Chuck?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.260 align:middle line:90%
That cow's been decaffeinated.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.298 align:middle line:90%


00:31:08.298 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
That's the man who
broke the sound barrier.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, I've had a
most interesting life.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Believe me.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:90%
So now I've got all this stuff.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm building rockets.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:90%
And my rockets are--

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.400 align:middle line:84%
you know, Homer's
was about 12 inches.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Mine is like 8 feet.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're big, and they're
moving along pretty good,

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:40.480 align:middle line:84%
but I need bigger rockets with
more power so I could research.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And then that's where my
dad enters this story.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.890 align:middle line:90%


00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.930 align:middle line:84%
The superintendent of the
mines, my mother's dad,

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
looks at my dad and he says,
Fred, I'm taking you out

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:84%
of the mines because
people are killed

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.510 align:middle line:90%
every single week at the mines.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So he didn't want
his grandchildren

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:02.540 align:middle line:90%
to not have a dad.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So my dad, who was a
functional illiterate,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.040 align:middle line:84%
was gifted in auto mechanics
like you would not believe.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So my superintendent
granddad, he got a garage

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and put my dad in it.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And now my dad has his
own service station,

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and it was a success
from the first week.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:90%
All these cars would come in.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.037 align:middle line:84%
Now, these cars would come in
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

00:32:28.037 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And I remember my mother and dad
putting blankets over windows

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.470 align:middle line:84%
so you can't see the lights
because there's somebody

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:36.620 align:middle line:84%
out there looking for
lights in a garage.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Because these cars
come in, under the hood

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.210 align:middle line:84%
is like a 392
Chrysler hemi engine.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Powerful.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:84%
In the trunk is a
200 gallon tank.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.020 align:middle line:90%
A gallon weighs nine pounds.

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.590 align:middle line:90%
1,800 pounds in the trunk.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.480 align:middle line:90%
They're moon runners.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:90%
Moonshine runners.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And the revenuers are
looking for the garages.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Where are these big, high
powered cars getting tuned up?

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.840 align:middle line:90%
My dad.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And dad would turn these cars
into Mopar Missiles, man.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at-- like
a 426 hemi would come in.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.600 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at
800 horsepower.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.270 align:middle line:84%
But they got to do
130, 140 miles an hour

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:90%
with 1,800 pounds in the trunk.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And they got real good at
steering mountain roads, right?

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is where all the
NASCAR drivers came from.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:32.550 align:middle line:90%
They were moon runners.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Buddy Baker, Fred Lorenzen,
and AJ Foyt, Lee Petty.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.230 align:middle line:84%
All these guys did
all this stuff.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.860 align:middle line:90%
Didn't know that, did you?

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:90%
It's all over the internet.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, my dad's tuning up these
cars and getting them out.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
So dad's working during the
day, and this guy comes in.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
His car broke down.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:55.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a Spicer carburetor.

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:57.180 align:middle line:84%
You had to see this
thing to believe it.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It's got a water
jacket around it.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It'd take you a whole day
to change a carburetor.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Dad looked at it and he
said, I can change it out

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.060 align:middle line:90%
in about 1 hour and 10 minutes.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And the owner of the car said,
can I stand and watch this?

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:10.679 align:middle line:90%
He said, sure.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.969 align:middle line:90%
Dad was lightning fast.

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And the man asked him,
are you always this fast?

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And dad said, yeah, when
I can see what I'm doing.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.850 align:middle line:90%
He didn't get the joke.

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:19.699 align:middle line:90%
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:23.699 align:middle line:84%
So he changed it, and the
guy said, holy smokes.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:27.210 align:middle line:90%
He said, you're right.

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:29.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my way from Detroit.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I've signed contracts
with Chrysler.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm on my way to Daytona.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to race on
the beach on the sand.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hire
you as my mechanic.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.635 align:middle line:90%
You'd like that?

00:34:38.635 --> 00:34:39.510 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to do it?

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:90%
He said, sure.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.090 align:middle line:90%
The guy sticks out his hand.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Hi, my name is Lee Petty.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.889 align:middle line:84%
And so we ended up moving to
Florida and did the racing.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:90%
My dad was Lee Petty's mechanic.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Then they moved to
Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.040 align:middle line:84%
where I moved with them, and
by that time I'm three or four.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.770 align:middle line:90%
But I grew up in that shop.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And he had a son
named Richard Petty.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.630 align:middle line:90%
You ever heard of him?

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.260 align:middle line:84%
The most famous NASCAR
driver in history.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Why does this mean
anything to you?

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Inside a NASCAR shop
and a NASA shop,

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.880 align:middle line:90%
they are mirrors of each other.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
They got the same equipment,
materials, fuels, everything.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We were running
drag racers, so we

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:32.480 align:middle line:84%
had nitro, methane, liquid
oxygen, liquid hydrogen

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.700 align:middle line:84%
with all the special
equipment because it's

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.070 align:middle line:90%
325 degrees below zero.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.540 align:middle line:90%
Cryogenics.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Same thing NASA's got.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.790 align:middle line:84%
We have shears, benders,
cutters, splitters, rollers

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.830 align:middle line:90%
to build the cars.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.610 align:middle line:84%
What do you think I could
build in there, y'all?

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.310 align:middle line:84%
So I started to building my--
well, let's back up just a bit.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:57.680 align:middle line:84%
The first engine I ever built
was a 426 Chrysler hemi engine.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.410 align:middle line:90%
Had 2 4 barrels, side drafts.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And on the dynamometer, I
made it to 975 horsepower.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:90%
That thing won a Grand National.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:90%
And my dad was so thrilled.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, boy, wait
till the people find out

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:20.150 align:middle line:84%
my son, only 12 years old,
built this powerful engine.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And Lee Petty went,
wait a minute, Fred.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.600 align:middle line:90%
Hold on, hold on.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.130 align:middle line:84%
We can't say anything
about it, you understand?

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:28.600 align:middle line:90%
We've got two reasons.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.787 align:middle line:84%
One is the child labor
laws, and the other one

00:36:31.787 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
is that man standing over
there named Bill France,

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.040 align:middle line:90%
chairman of NASCAR.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:84%
He's going to hang us all
dead from this tree over here

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.150 align:middle line:90%
because you can't be doing this.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, David,
you understand?

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.490 align:middle line:90%
It's no problem.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I was just glad to get to
build an engine like that.

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why some scientists
have asked me, how in the world

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.410 align:middle line:84%
did a rocket scientist get
an arm that looks like that,

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.210 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, from honing
big block engines.

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:03.660 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the Pettys
looked at me and--

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:90%
especially Richard.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we feel
bad about this, David.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.270 align:middle line:90%
Anything we can do for you?

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:90%
Could I have this shop at night?

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:90%
Give me a set of keys.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.823 align:middle line:90%
Give me alarm codes.

00:37:13.823 --> 00:37:16.230 align:middle line:90%


00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.480 align:middle line:84%
If there's any material
you can't find in here,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.950 align:middle line:90%
we'll order it.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Man, I am so set.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing
there in the middle

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Pettys'
state-of-the-art NASCAR shop,

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
looking around at night, by
myself, doors are locked,

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and it all belongs to
me, and I start building.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first rocket
that came out of there

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.530 align:middle line:90%
was almost 10 feet tall.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Weighed about 1,000 pounds.

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And when I launched the
thing out of the backyard,

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I incinerated an area the
size of a football field.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.490 align:middle line:90%
It went 52,500 feet up.

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:90%
That's over 10 miles.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It was clocking
4,300 miles an hour.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Not bad for my first rocket.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So the Pettys just saw--
came to one of my launches

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and they went, this is insane.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.730 align:middle line:90%
You built that out of the shop?

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> What year?

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> What year?

00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:19.250 align:middle line:90%
That year was 1964.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So we went on, and
my dad got injured,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.470 align:middle line:90%
and so we quit the racing stuff.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Moved to Ohio, and
then that's when

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I thought my rocket
stuff would slow down.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:84%
It went full bore because my
mother had to work, go to work,

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.250 align:middle line:90%
and my dad was hurt too bad.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So she met Curtis LeMay.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I was still building
rockets and firing them out

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.820 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth pit.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, by time
LeMay caught up with me,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I had a pretty
advanced shop going

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:00.220 align:middle line:84%
as it was because I
inherited all of Dad's tools.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.840 align:middle line:90%
So they were looking at it and--

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
LeMay came in and looked
at the shop and he said,

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea.

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, I can't wait
to see what this guy's idea is

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.860 align:middle line:90%
going to be like.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:20.290 align:middle line:84%
I knew of him, but I didn't
know how much power and weight

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.960 align:middle line:90%
he threw around.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:27.310 align:middle line:84%
He had the entire military
industrial complex

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:90%
carte blanche--

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Curtis LeMay?

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.800 align:middle line:90%
And he handed it to me.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.970 align:middle line:84%
He said, you know that big, new
type of rocket you're building?

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:38.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to give you
everything you want,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.230 align:middle line:90%
and all the personnel.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Just build it.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:51.910 align:middle line:84%
so his XO knocked on the
door on January 6, 1969.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.650 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is that important?

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Because back on November
1968, Curtis LeMay

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.320 align:middle line:84%
ran for vice president
of the United States

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.560 align:middle line:84%
with the president
candidate George C. Wallace.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember all that?

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.320 align:middle line:90%
They lost.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And the reason LeMay was
running for vice president,

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:90%
he got fired.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.047 align:middle line:90%
He was a general that said--

00:40:15.047 --> 00:40:17.630 align:middle line:84%
he told North Vietnamese, if you
don't come to the Paris Peace

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Talks, I'll bomb you
back into the Stone Age.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And his nickname was Bombs
Away LeMay from World War II.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.590 align:middle line:84%
So he got fired the next
morning by Robert McNamara.

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:29.300 align:middle line:90%
Remember that name?

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Secretary of defense.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.420 align:middle line:90%
So was he going to quit?

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, that man, 56
years old, being fired,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.860 align:middle line:84%
now, he ain't looking
at retirement.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:41.382 align:middle line:84%
He's just looking
at the situation.

00:40:41.382 --> 00:40:42.590 align:middle line:90%
So he ran for vice president.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't get it.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.170 align:middle line:90%
When do you vote?

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:90%
Second Tuesday of November.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.470 align:middle line:90%
Holidays go by.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.248 align:middle line:84%
Soon as the holidays are gone,
I get a knock on the front door.

00:40:52.248 --> 00:40:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And I open it up, and
there's a full bird Colonel

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.660 align:middle line:84%
standing there in uniform,
looking at me, saying,

00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.090 align:middle line:84%
General LeMay sent
me here, and I

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:01.340 align:middle line:84%
am to help you put
together everything

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.502 align:middle line:90%
you want to build that rocket.

00:41:04.502 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:90%
I went, OK.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.120 align:middle line:90%
And we start.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And lord have mercy, they
walk out and look at my lab.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.850 align:middle line:84%
My lab was an old car
dealership, you know?

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:21.643 align:middle line:84%
The big garage, grease
pits, and all that stuff.

00:41:21.643 --> 00:41:23.560 align:middle line:84%
My parents bought a
house, and it came with it

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.380 align:middle line:90%
at the far end of the property.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, LeMay and Colonel
Williams walked in there

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and looked at it and
said, yeah, that'll work.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.200 align:middle line:84%
There was an open area
as big as this room.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And they built-- they
boarded up the windows,

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:84%
they built fake
sliding walls, and they

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.450 align:middle line:84%
brought in a state of
the art machine shop.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I had plasma arc welders.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I had spectrometers.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.990 align:middle line:90%
I had chemical analysis.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it looked like something
from James Bond sitting in

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.080 align:middle line:90%
this little--

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.710 align:middle line:84%
this big building now sitting
in the middle of Mount Liberty,

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Ohio, and we started to work.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Colonel Williams
if all the Air Force people

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.560 align:middle line:84%
would take their uniforms off
and wear blue jeans and plaid

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.210 align:middle line:84%
shirts so they'd blend in
with the farm community,

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and they did.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.457 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go to school in
the morning, come back

00:42:19.457 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon,
and all these people

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.290 align:middle line:84%
were in this building
waiting for me to walk in,

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.670 align:middle line:90%
and we'd start construction.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:84%
We worked till about 11 o'clock
at night, and I'd go to bed,

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.740 align:middle line:90%
and we'd get up, day after day.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.730 align:middle line:84%
26 and 1/2 months we
worked on this thing.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:90%
And I ordered materials.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.170 align:middle line:90%
And LeMay was smart.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.990 align:middle line:84%
When things come in, they'd
tear all the labels off

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.230 align:middle line:90%
and burn them.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.370 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't see where all
the stuff was coming from,

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:90%
but it did catch a few names.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.990 align:middle line:84%
Lawrence Livermore
Laboratories; Los Alamos;

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.140 align:middle line:90%
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.840 align:middle line:90%
The list just went on and on.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And so one thing Stanton
Friedman's right,

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:03.040 align:middle line:84%
he said, you can't build a
rocket like he says he built,

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:05.380 align:middle line:90%
you know, just in a local shop.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.460 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.590 align:middle line:90%
I had an army of personnel.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Literally an Air Force army.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And every laboratory in
America and other countries

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.920 align:middle line:90%
were helping.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And they all make
certain little parts.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.540 align:middle line:84%
It's modulized and
it hooks together.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And nobody knew what the final
assembly was, except for me.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, we put
that thing together.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:84%
26 and 1/2 months
later, it's done.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.880 align:middle line:90%
And y'all need to see--

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.860 align:middle line:90%
you haven't seen Pitholem yet.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:35.930 align:middle line:84%
I have some pictures going
around on the internet.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.330 align:middle line:90%
That's not Pitholem.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.590 align:middle line:90%
That was the dummy.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:43.150 align:middle line:84%
We built a fake rocket so we
could carry it around on cars,

00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and people in the
community got used

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to seeing us dragging
missiles around.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.050 align:middle line:90%
And they never saw the real one.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The real one looked
like something

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.530 align:middle line:90%
from a Buck Rogers movie.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:58.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's another incident.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what day to day
operations are like.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.110 align:middle line:84%
LeMay came up to
me and said, you're

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.180 align:middle line:84%
going to need a body for
that rocket engine, yeah?

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what's
the biggest, baddest thing

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:13.220 align:middle line:90%
you've got?

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.360 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well,
the Titan missile.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, give
me a Titan missile.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.740 align:middle line:90%
And he does.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.657 align:middle line:84%
Congress gives me
a Titan missile.

00:44:21.657 --> 00:44:22.740 align:middle line:90%
And I said, wait a minute.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You got to have a
military escort crew.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Let me ride over and
look at the missile.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.683 align:middle line:84%
So I went down to
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:44:28.683 --> 00:44:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Base, Dayton, Ohio,
there's the missile.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I do some tests
on it, look at it.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.220 align:middle line:90%
And they ask me, what happens--

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.930 align:middle line:90%
he said, will that rocket work?

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And I said, let me answer
your question with a question.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.840 align:middle line:84%
What's the last thing going
through a mosquito's mind

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.260 align:middle line:84%
when he hits a windshield
at 80 miles an hour?

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.100 align:middle line:90%
His ass.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.430 align:middle line:84%
And the lady said,
what are you saying?

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:58.050 align:middle line:84%
My rocket engine will go through
this rocket like Styrofoam.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not strong enough.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:00.960 align:middle line:84%
He goes, that's
the baddest thing

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.690 align:middle line:90%
we've got in the US arsenal.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not going to work.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So I built the engine, and then
I built the rocket around it.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And you have got
to see this thing.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to build the rocket
as heavy as I can make it

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.570 align:middle line:84%
because, see, I'm worried about
the engine on a power curve.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.600 align:middle line:84%
This type of engine shouldn't
even be launched on Earth.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It should be launched,
hell, out at L5,

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.600 align:middle line:84%
which is the
gravitational equilibrium

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.160 align:middle line:90%
between the Earth and the moon.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.110 align:middle line:84%
This thing's going to
have so much power.

00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:32.430 align:middle line:90%
There's only two speeds--

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:90%
off and wide open.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.610 align:middle line:84%
So he said, you think
you can build it?

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can build it.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I made it out
of a special material,

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:47.730 align:middle line:90%
which this is weird in itself.

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.620 align:middle line:90%
It came from England.

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Don't know where-- the origin
of the metal is unknown.

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It was discovered
in World War II.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something that
came out of Nazi Germany.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But this material
is called carbnit.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said that on Art Bell,
and everybody said, oh, he's

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.800 align:middle line:90%
copying "Star Wars."

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Han Solo was frozen
in carbonite.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And I went, I'm from the South.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I approach English
as a second language.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.930 align:middle line:84%
I come from where "y'all" is
singular and "all y'all" is

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.870 align:middle line:90%
plural.

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:22.680 align:middle line:90%
It's carbnit.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:23.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Carbonite-- it's
C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E--

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is what Han Solo
became a Popsicle.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, this is
C-A-R-B-N-I-T. Carbnit.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's unlike anything
you've ever seen.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.050 align:middle line:84%
When the metal's in a finished
form, it's as slick and shiny

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:90%
as glass.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what--

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:56.230 align:middle line:84%
the melting point,
5,500 degrees.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:90%
That is mind boggling.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:02.140 align:middle line:84%
To give you an idea, at 1,350
degrees, aluminum melts.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:05.170 align:middle line:84%
This stuff had to have five
times that temperature.

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:08.278 align:middle line:84%
You ever wonder-- you know,
you have a big cauldron

00:47:08.278 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and you pour in all
this molten metal

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.028 align:middle line:84%
and the cauldron takes it
over here and pours it out?

00:47:12.028 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:90%
You've seen it.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.680 align:middle line:84%
What's that cauldron
made out of?

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Inconel.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.060 align:middle line:84%
This thing had twice the
temperature of Inconel.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.512 align:middle line:84%
Who in God's name even
made a material like this?

00:47:22.512 --> 00:47:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Where does that come from?

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.110 align:middle line:84%
There was only
2,000 pounds known,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and I got every pound of it.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it from this planet?

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.878 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:47:31.878 --> 00:47:33.170 align:middle line:90%
It's funny you should say that.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:35.582 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:47:35.582 --> 00:47:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought the same
thing, so I run it

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.840 align:middle line:90%
through a metallurgy analysis.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.580 align:middle line:84%
About a third of the
thing didn't even

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.510 align:middle line:90%
show up on the chart.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, man, this stuff
is not from the neighborhood.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:50.540 align:middle line:90%
But it worked.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was so beautiful
when we got done with it.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:59.482 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I used to sleep
in a bed, a cot, in the lab.

00:47:59.482 --> 00:48:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And it was wintertime,
it was cold,

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and they had the
furnace running.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:04.930 align:middle line:84%
Remember those square
furnaces on the wall?

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.460 align:middle line:90%
They had porcelain, orange blue.

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.430 align:middle line:84%
It'd be running,
and it's shining off

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.740 align:middle line:90%
the hull of Pitholem.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.770 align:middle line:84%
The most beautiful
thing you ever seen.

00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'd lay there, go
to sleep looking at it.

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:18.820 align:middle line:90%
Just amazing.

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, I'll get
that thing built,

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:22.150 align:middle line:90%
and y'all will get to see it.

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.330 align:middle line:84%
You'll look at it and go, man,
that is not a normal rocket.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.800 align:middle line:84%
That's something
from somewhere else.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.760 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way
I had to build it.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.723 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we got it
built, got it completed.

00:48:35.723 --> 00:48:38.140 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of parts to these
stories I'm skipping over.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.370 align:middle line:90%
This takes so long.

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It took Art Bell from
11:00 PM to 7:00 AM

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to get this whole
story out of me.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:47.900 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I have the longest
interview on "Coast to Coast"

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.700 align:middle line:90%
in history.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.570 align:middle line:84%
That was told to
me by George Noory.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.970 align:middle line:84%
So he said, you know,
you've got the longest--

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.920 align:middle line:90%
seven hours nonstop.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.450 align:middle line:84%
A couple of times, Art Bell
stopped and told everybody,

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.210 align:middle line:90%
stop writing in.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:10.210 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's going to come on
air, do a seven-hour lie--

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.190 align:middle line:84%
dozens of characters,
thousands of details.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Nobody can do that.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So just stop and
listen to the story.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So anyway-- so I got
this thing completed.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere
along all this way,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.510 align:middle line:84%
the Congressman
Ashbrook got involved.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:30.910 align:middle line:90%
And I liked the congressman.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.640 align:middle line:84%
He was the last
of the Boy Scouts.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.120 align:middle line:90%
I swear, man.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:39.490 align:middle line:84%
He was so hon-- can you
imagine an honest congressman?

00:49:39.490 --> 00:49:40.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, there was one.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.770 align:middle line:90%
I actually met him, you know?

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like I got a picture
of Bigfoot, you know?

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually got a picture
of an honest congressman.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.560 align:middle line:90%
And it got him killed, though.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.360 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:56.140 align:middle line:84%
He was murdered by a
really sweet little guy

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.200 align:middle line:90%
named Arthur Rudolph.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Look his name up
on the internet.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Came in through
Operation Paperclip

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:04.720 align:middle line:90%
with Wernher von Braun.

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.470 align:middle line:84%
He is the chief architect of
the F-1 Saturn V moon rocket

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:90%
engines.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.680 align:middle line:84%
He's the winner of the
Distinguished Service

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Award, the highest
award NASA can give.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:18.040 align:middle line:84%
He's also a full
colonel in the gestapo

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and murdered 100,000 people
personally, and medaled for it.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It's where they built
the V-2 rockets.

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And if you made a mistake
on the assembly line,

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:32.540 align:middle line:84%
he disemboweled you with a hook
bill and its big curved blade

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:35.632 align:middle line:84%
And they'd hang you from the
rafters by your intestines

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:38.830 align:middle line:84%
until you stunk so bad that
the guards would bury you.

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:44.230 align:middle line:84%
That's the recipient of NASA's
Distinguished Service Award.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Ain't that wonderful?

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And you think I'm
making this up?

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Look it up on the internet.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this all
the way back in 1968

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:54.425 align:middle line:90%
because I was dealing with him.

00:50:54.425 --> 00:50:58.540 align:middle line:90%


00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:03.730 align:middle line:84%
He's blond haired,
blue eye, Aryan race.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:08.040 align:middle line:84%
And, boy, that guy
got on my case.

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And von Braun warned
me that if he ever

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:12.360 align:middle line:84%
showed up in my projects,
I'd be in such trouble.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, come to find out
later, he was exactly right.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So we take the rocket out and
we put it in a Piggly Wiggly--

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that's a real name
of a grocery store.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.390 align:middle line:84%
I looked at Piggly
Wiggly and I asked

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
my mother one time, went,
is there a bigger version

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:32.490 align:middle line:90%
called Hoggly Woggly?

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:35.160 align:middle line:84%
She said, you're
demented, David.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.420 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, we put Pitholem
inside Piggly Wiggly's semi,

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and we take it to
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:42.870 align:middle line:90%
Base.

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And I get there, and we pull up,
and there's a C-141 Starlifter.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.500 align:middle line:90%
You ever seen one of them?

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Magnificent thing.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Big four engines.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's a ring of
military people with guns,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:58.350 align:middle line:90%
and they're all standing there.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And we pulled up there
and I told the driver,

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:84%
don't pull past
that ring of guards.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.370 align:middle line:90%
We'll get shot.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And he turned around--

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:06.075 align:middle line:90%
they're here for you.

00:52:06.075 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:90%


00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:09.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.440 align:middle line:90%
They're protecting your rocket.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.160 align:middle line:84%
So we put the rocket in the
Starlifter, and off we went.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And we flew to White
Sands, New Mexico.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.652 align:middle line:84%
White Sands Missile
Proving Grounds.

00:52:23.652 --> 00:52:26.920 align:middle line:84%
That's not its name now,
but that was its name then.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So we got out and went to
the far end of the pads

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:33.730 align:middle line:84%
down at the very last one,
and we put Pitholem in place,

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
ready to fire it off.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.930 align:middle line:90%
And Rudolph shows up.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
standing at the hangar,

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:45.690 align:middle line:84%
and this black DC-9
came in and stopped--

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and rolled up to a stop.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And I asked Colonel Williams,
where's the white bunny head?

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.550 align:middle line:84%
See, back in those
years, Hugh Hefner

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.160 align:middle line:84%
had a black DC-9 with
a white bunny head.

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Except I noticed Colonel
Williams wasn't smiling.

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.680 align:middle line:90%
He said, hold on a minute.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.520 align:middle line:90%
And out came these people.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And here come all these
guys in black suits,

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.530 align:middle line:84%
little skinny black ties,
and mirrored sunglasses.

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:11.360 align:middle line:90%
So help me.

00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And every time I see "MIB,"
I seen them people before.

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, they came off
the plane, came over to us,

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and behind them came off a
guy with little khaki shorts.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.210 align:middle line:90%
Looked like Steve Irwin.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I heard Colonel
Williams go, oh, god.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:27.220 align:middle line:90%
I said, what?

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, that's
Rudolph coming here.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:34.534 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered the
name from von Braun.

00:53:34.534 --> 00:53:35.870 align:middle line:90%
I went, we got problems?

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:36.770 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Big time.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So he comes up and
he asks me who I am.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I'm the guy
that built the rocket.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him, who are you?

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:84%
He says, I'm just
a guy that goes

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.450 align:middle line:84%
around looking at
new technologies

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:55.260 align:middle line:90%
for the government.

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.760 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.040 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.510 align:middle line:90%
So I know he's lying.

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.710 align:middle line:90%
So he came over--

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.820 align:middle line:90%
he wanted to see Pitholem.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So I opened up Pitholem, and I
have a bar of metal in my hand.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.930 align:middle line:90%
Weighs about two pounds.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just slide
it down the hull.

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And what was no seams,
these seams come up,

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:20.165 align:middle line:84%
the panel raises up,
and slides to the side.

00:54:20.165 --> 00:54:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at that
and he goes, what is that?

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's called
a dissimilar metal lock.

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.560 align:middle line:90%
It's old.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It came from technology
World War II.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:31.950 align:middle line:90%
It came with the carbnit.

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:34.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling, y'all, there's
something weird about that

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.660 align:middle line:90%
whole package when it showed up.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I don't
know anything about that.

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yeah, I thought
that's kind of arrogant.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know
about it, it's not real?

00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said, you know,
it worked fine.

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:52.332 align:middle line:90%
So he's got his head down there.

00:54:52.332 --> 00:54:54.540 align:middle line:84%
He's across from me, and he
bends down and looks down

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.500 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought, it's a
good time to do it.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:55:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So I got down over by his
ear, and I look in there

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.900 align:middle line:90%
and I tell him, see that engine?

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.930 align:middle line:84%
Is gone half a million times
the power of the Saturn V

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:09.510 align:middle line:90%
engine, Dr. Rudolph.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And his head popped up, and
he's all red as a tomato.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:14.440 align:middle line:90%
He asked me, who are you?

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.620 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I'm just
a kid that launches

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.570 align:middle line:90%
rockets in the cow field.

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.260 align:middle line:84%
They brought me down
here to test this thing.

00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.400 align:middle line:90%
He's all bent out of shape.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:26.670 align:middle line:84%
But he takes over
the entire project.

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:28.710 align:middle line:84%
He takes Colonel
Williams, and arrests him,

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and puts him in his own
quarters and locks him up.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man,
this is not good.

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:37.170 align:middle line:90%
And then I said--

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:44.400 align:middle line:90%
well, let's see.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.650 align:middle line:84%
We got, what, an hour and
a half when we started?

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.050 align:middle line:90%
Started at 2:00?

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm skipping over
some large chunks,

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.230 align:middle line:84%
but it's so much
fun if you hear it.

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:56.780 align:middle line:90%


00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Before he got locked
up, Colonel Williams, we

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.050 align:middle line:84%
went to the block house and
we test fired Pitholem out

00:56:03.050 --> 00:56:04.480 align:middle line:90%
of there.

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:90%
So Pitholem is winding up.

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:08.380 align:middle line:90%
The cyclotrons are starting.

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.570 align:middle line:84%
The fields are
starting to sustain.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I can see all the readings.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting this
vibration in the ground

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.250 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
to be significant.

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:21.520 align:middle line:84%
They have it on a pad
about two miles from us,

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and the entire missile
range is closed down.

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:30.070 align:middle line:84%
There was an old guy that
called in on Art Bell, said,

00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I retired from White Sands and
I remember the day, June 20,

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:39.250 align:middle line:84%
1971, they shut the range
down, first and only time,

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.650 align:middle line:90%
and now I know why.

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Because this guy.

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.870 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, I guess so.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So everybody had to
go into buildings.

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was allowed
to be walking around.

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So we test fired
this thing, and I'm

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:55.690 align:middle line:84%
glad they did that because it
would've been uncomfortable

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.830 align:middle line:90%
on some people.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:00.190 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, it's
winding up and you

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:03.633 align:middle line:84%
can see a light come out of
the bottom of the engines.

00:57:03.633 --> 00:57:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It's distorted
looking, but that's

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:10.460 align:middle line:84%
from the magnetic fields that
is coming out of the rocket.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I extended the
magnetic fields out

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:16.240 align:middle line:84%
past the tail of the rocket,
because if I didn't, the rocket

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.780 align:middle line:84%
would get burned up
from the exhaust.

00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:23.360 align:middle line:84%
The exhaust is about 100
million degrees centigrade.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's worn out, and it's
getting brighter and brighter.

00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:32.620 align:middle line:84%
It's going from blue to
white to super bright

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.320 align:middle line:90%
where it's metallic bright.

00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:36.610 align:middle line:90%
An arc welder.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Same-- one million candle
power per square inch

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:41.710 align:middle line:90%
is what it's doing.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You can't see-- it's the sun.

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.260 align:middle line:90%
So it detonates.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:90%
It takes off.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.110 align:middle line:90%
But we don't see it--

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:50.410 align:middle line:84%
it's just a massive
explosion and it's gone,

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.120 align:middle line:84%
and everybody thought
the rocket blew up.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there and
I'm watching my watch,

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.680 align:middle line:90%
counting the seconds.

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And then this red
phone goes off.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So Williams picks it up and
he's looking at it on the phone.

00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:04.870 align:middle line:90%
He says, yeah.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.570 align:middle line:84%
He said, you hear the
guy on the red phone?

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:08.560 align:middle line:90%
You know who it is?

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.950 align:middle line:90%
NORAD.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:12.060 align:middle line:84%
North American Air
Defense Command.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:15.730 align:middle line:84%
They're tracking a missile
that has left White Sands.

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the speed-- you can hear
the guy clear across the room

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:19.840 align:middle line:90%
on the phone.

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:23.980 align:middle line:84%
He's yelling because, what
did you people do down there?

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had a civilian
rocket blow up.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Blow up?

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Hell.

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you
see where it's at?

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:37.160 align:middle line:90%
It's 126 miles in 3.2 seconds.

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.090 align:middle line:90%
That's about Mach 37.

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:42.120 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing on
Earth that's that fast.

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this guy is
just freaking out.

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And they said, no, we
didn't see anything leave.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And the guy said, yeah, can
you see a 30-aught-6 bullet

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.040 align:middle line:90%
leave a rifle barrel?

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:55.030 align:middle line:84%
That's about what
you've got there.

00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:56.490 align:middle line:90%
And he said, it's way too big.

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:59.770 align:middle line:90%
It's tons of-- it's gone.

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.020 align:middle line:90%
And they're all looking at me.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:03.390 align:middle line:84%
But I skipped a
very important part.

00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:06.450 align:middle line:84%
When it was winding up,
getting brighter and brighter--

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Williams,
who had a background,

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.660 align:middle line:90%
he had a PHD in astrophysics--

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and he turned to me and
said, when did you have time

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.800 align:middle line:90%
to test the magnetic shields?

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.050 align:middle line:90%
I said, when?

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.930 align:middle line:84%
You've been with me every
day for 26 and 1/2 months.

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:25.835 align:middle line:90%
This is the test.

00:59:25.835 --> 00:59:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I could
see his face and I

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.950 align:middle line:90%
could see the wheels turning.

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, look, see the
big flat wall behind us?

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's do a jumping jack.

00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll make the coolest
shadows you've ever seen.

00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:41.310 align:middle line:84%
'Cause if those
fields don't sustain,

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:44.025 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at the
sun two miles away.

00:59:44.025 --> 00:59:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It's Hiroshima.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.850 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
just disintegrated.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.170 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, oh, god.

00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And he hit the red button.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It's too late.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.200 align:middle line:90%
It's on internal power.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Rudolph is out of his chair,
dropped his coffee cup,

00:59:55.650 --> 00:59:57.490 align:middle line:84%
and was standing
right next to me,

00:59:57.490 --> 01:00:00.040 align:middle line:84%
so fast I didn't
even see him move.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, are
you worried too?

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:08.100 align:middle line:84%
So it held together
and it worked.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I just don't know
how, in god's name,

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.335 align:middle line:90%
we ever got it right first time.

01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was at a point, since
everything's been taken over,

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.080 align:middle line:84%
we'll just disintegrate
everything and be done with it.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It will be a flash, and then
I'm not in Kansas anymore, Toto.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.440 align:middle line:90%
So I wasn't worried about it.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:24.570 align:middle line:90%
But they were worried about it.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
So the technicians
all standing there.

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember the coffee pouring
out of this one guy's mouth

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
because he just heard,
this is the test.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.270 align:middle line:90%
So it worked.

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And the guy on the
phone said, do you

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:40.670 align:middle line:90%
see where it's coming down at?

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:42.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Arthur programmed it.

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And it was so high, it just
had to do a hyperbolic curve

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.450 align:middle line:84%
at apogee, and it just
peered right on over

01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and floated in where
it wanted to go,

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
which was about 456
miles Northwest of us

01:00:56.940 --> 01:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
in a place called Groom Lake.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.070 align:middle line:84%
So he programmed it
to go to Groom Lake.

01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And I asked him, why--

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.800 align:middle line:90%
going all the way there?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.633 align:middle line:84%
You can drop it right
back on the base here.

01:01:06.633 --> 01:01:08.850 align:middle line:84%
We'd only have to go
a mile to pick it up.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:10.600 align:middle line:90%
Different agenda.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So Pitholem ends
up at Groom Lake,

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
right dead center in the
middle of the dry lake bed.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We get on a plane
and we take off.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Bell's arrested
and put in house arrest.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:25.140 align:middle line:84%
I get on the jet,
and I said, you

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.290 align:middle line:84%
know it's rubber tires
under this plane?

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:28.700 align:middle line:90%
You're going to a dry lake bed.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
You're going to bury up to
the belly in this thing.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.140 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with you people?

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Shut up and get on board.

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, we get there, and
there's a huge base.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not even on the map.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
You can see where they're
staking out in line

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.670 align:middle line:90%
for 10,000 foot runways.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.720 align:middle line:90%
We landed on a taxi ramp.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.550 align:middle line:90%
That's how big it was.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And we just leaned
on the taxi ramp

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and went to the center hangar.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:00.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's Area 51, y'all.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that name.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.708 align:middle line:90%
I knew nothing about it.

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But I could see Pitholem
sitting out there,

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and its parachutes
fluttering in the wind.

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I thought, damn.

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.660 align:middle line:90%
It made it.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was pretty thrilled about
that, but nobody is talking.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.090 align:middle line:10%
So we get out of the plane,
we go to the center hangar,

01:02:15.090 --> 01:02:17.160 align:middle line:10%
go sit in these golf
cart looking things.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.660 align:middle line:90%
They were weird.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Everything on this base
just didn't add up.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing made sense.

01:02:24.810 --> 01:02:28.390 align:middle line:84%
These golf carts had
a light in the center

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
that was recessed back in.

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:30.940 align:middle line:90%
You could see what it was.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.650 align:middle line:90%
Made the strangest sound.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It winds up and it
gets brighter inside.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And these things are
fast and they take off.

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So we pull into the hangar
and we're sitting there.

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, well, this is good.

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Nice hangar.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
noticed the hangar.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
If you get right
up to the walls,

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
it's painted to look old,
but it's brand new inside.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And the lights on
top of the roof

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
have louvers, so the
lights shine straight down.

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you're straight out there
somewhere, you can't see it.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want this whole
place to be seen at all.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And making it look
painted old, that

01:03:10.030 --> 01:03:12.160 align:middle line:84%
may fool the
satellites over by--

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
so there's something
up with this place.

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sitting there and
then the floor, bigger

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.130 align:middle line:90%
than a gymnasium, just drops.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
The whole floor.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's concrete.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, god
almighty, it's an elevator?

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the weight
on this thing.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.040 align:middle line:90%
Just the floor alone.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And so when we got
down below the floor

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're going on
down the pit, you

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
can see what's
carrying everything.

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:40.720 align:middle line:90%
There's these giant worm screws.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen the garage door
opener, the thing that spins?

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.280 align:middle line:90%
That's a worm screw.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.640 align:middle line:84%
These worm screws, the
size of sequoia trees.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.070 align:middle line:90%
12 of them.

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:54.790 align:middle line:84%
So whatever they're picking up
and down, it is ungodly heavy.

01:03:54.790 --> 01:04:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So it goes down about, let's
say, 200 feet, 20 stories,

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:02.110 align:middle line:90%
and flush out on the floor.

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And now we're looking
down a causeway that

01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
has a kind of an arched roof
with sides that come down

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and they counter where they're
perpendicular to each other.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And then these walls are shops,
and work bays, and hangars.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And we take off on this
stupid golf cart thing

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and we're driving
down through there.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the other
thing I noticed.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.935 align:middle line:90%
We're way underground, right?

01:04:28.935 --> 01:04:30.280 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the stories?

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.850 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly lit.

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:34.530 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful lighting.

01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I went like this, and
I went, you're kidding.

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.760 align:middle line:90%
No shadows.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, how
is that working?

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:44.850 align:middle line:90%
And then I looked around.

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
No light fixtures.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The whole place is
perfectly lit, evenly,

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.168 align:middle line:90%
like a paint booth in a car.

01:04:52.168 --> 01:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Because you can't have shadows.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You get to running the
paint and not see it.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Perfectly lit.

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.462 align:middle line:90%
No light fixtures.

01:04:57.462 --> 01:04:59.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, are you telling me

01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:03.690 align:middle line:90%
the atmosphere is the lights?

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:05.507 align:middle line:90%
What is wrong with this place?

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:06.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it phosphorous?

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:10.920 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea how that worked.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, this is why I said
nothing seems quite right down

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.840 align:middle line:90%
there.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, this is
not a normal facility.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So we get down,
drive about a mile.

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And we get down,
and over on the left

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is this giant Iris
like a camera.

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Except that thing's
40 feet in diameter.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And a man jumps
out, puts his face

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
in this tunnel looking thing,
got both hands on this panel.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:43.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a flash,
then the iris opens.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there going,
is that a retina scanner, palm

01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:50.280 align:middle line:90%
sc--

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.200 align:middle line:90%
it's 1971, y'all.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't even have
handheld calculators yet.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And they got this stuff going?

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Man, it's more of things
don't look right down here.

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:02.850 align:middle line:90%
When did they get that?

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So we drive in,
the lights come up.

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:07.140 align:middle line:90%
No light fixtures.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.580 align:middle line:90%
No shadows.

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:09.840 align:middle line:90%
Lights come up.

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, how do they do that?

01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And we drive over to the
end of this big, big room,

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
and there's a stage over there.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:22.380 align:middle line:10%
Like a big, metal platform
stage, and these big,

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.070 align:middle line:10%
heavy curtains made of rubber.

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.810 align:middle line:90%
You know, like a mud flap.

01:06:26.810 --> 01:06:30.320 align:middle line:84%
You ever try and pick
up a semi mud flap?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.020 align:middle line:90%
It weighs as much as you do.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, these things
were gigantic,

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.100 align:middle line:90%
so they would weigh tons.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to run
over and go, take a look.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So the chains go off, up in
the ceiling, lifts thing up.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And then setting
on this stage is--

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.250 align:middle line:90%


01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I was disappointed.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.000 align:middle line:10%
See, I just built an
electromagnetic fusion

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.170 align:middle line:10%
containment engine, and
it was about this big.

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.260 align:middle line:10%
I thought, man, I'm
hot stuff, you know?

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, they lift the
curtains up on this thing,

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and there, the size
of an 18 wheel semi,

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
is an electromagnetic
fusion containment engine.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had a Model A, and
they've got a Lamborghini.

01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And but one thing that you
can look at both them--

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:21.820 align:middle line:84%
you look at a Model A
engine from Henry Ford

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.668 align:middle line:90%
and a Lamborghini of today--

01:07:23.668 --> 01:07:25.210 align:middle line:84%
the one thing you
can tell by looking

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:28.910 align:middle line:84%
at both them, internal
combustion engine.

01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:30.557 align:middle line:84%
So when I looked
at this thing, I

01:07:30.557 --> 01:07:32.890 align:middle line:84%
knew it was an electromagnetic
fusion containment engine

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:35.680 align:middle line:84%
because it's built
very similar to mine,

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
but way more sophisticated
and way more powerful.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
odd stuff star--

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:45.670 align:middle line:84%
it's got an
ectoskeleton structure.

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
That's not normal.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And the skeleton structure's
got vertebrates and ribbings.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, man,
that's not normal.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And I thought--
later on, I think,

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
it was 1978, Sigourney
Weaver and "Aliens"?

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And the guy named HR Giger
came out with something

01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
he called organic technology.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at it,
going, I've seen that before.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:15.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was down--

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:16.310 align:middle line:90%
never mind.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.069 align:middle line:90%
It was in a basement somewhere.

01:08:18.069 --> 01:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, inside are the big
spheres that the cyclotrons

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:25.810 align:middle line:90%
would be on mine.

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And its surface was
like a dolphin skin.

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:32.729 align:middle line:90%
I used to pet dolphins.

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
Felt just like a dolphin.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.550 align:middle line:84%
I go, what is up
with this thing?

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So I asked Rudolph, can I
go up there and look at it?

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.600 align:middle line:90%
And he said sure.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.760 align:middle line:90%
Base personnel said no.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.750 align:middle line:90%
But I got to go.

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:46.520 align:middle line:90%
So now we know who's in charge.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.729 align:middle line:84%
So I go up there
and I look at it.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I get closer to it, and
on the floor, no shadows.

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
When I get about three feet
from it, as soon as I get close,

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.062 align:middle line:90%
there's my shadow.

01:08:58.062 --> 01:08:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm going-- looking around.

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.729 align:middle line:90%
No light fixtures.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:06.620 align:middle line:84%
But you go like this, and
about one half of one second,

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.200 align:middle line:84%
your shadow is
behind you, trailing.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's slow.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
And I went--

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
metal and I thought--

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, what pea
brain knowledge I had,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought, are you
telling me this

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.399 align:middle line:84%
is heat seeking
recognition alloy,

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.901 align:middle line:84%
and it's picking
up on my body heat?

01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:27.109 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought it was.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.390 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, dang.

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:33.229 align:middle line:84%
So I asked, can I crawl
up on top of this thing?

01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:35.160 align:middle line:90%
No-- Air Force.

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:35.960 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph-- Yeah.

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:36.884 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:09:36.884 --> 01:09:38.180 align:middle line:90%
So I crawl up on it.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.410 align:middle line:90%
And as soon as I put my--

01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:41.405 align:middle line:90%
I'm going up the ectoskeleton.

01:09:41.405 --> 01:09:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect ladder.

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.870 align:middle line:90%
So I'm crawling up this thing.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Stop, reach in, and
put my hand on the hull

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of this thing, and boy,
that's where the fun started.

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Soon as I slapped my hand
on it, everywhere the skin

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:57.500 align:middle line:84%
was touching with the hull
had these blue radiating

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.210 align:middle line:84%
waves that would do
this kind of number.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.130 align:middle line:84%
You ever seen them
things for executives

01:10:03.130 --> 01:10:05.060 align:middle line:90%
that go back and forth?

01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Motion waves that
calm executives down?

01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyway, that's what it's
doing down through the hulls.

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.972 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sitting there going--

01:10:12.972 --> 01:10:14.430 align:middle line:84%
pulled the hand
off and it stopped.

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I went, man, what
is that, you know?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:18.730 align:middle line:90%
So I keep on going up.

01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And I turned around and
looked over my left shoulder

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
while I was doing that, and
I'm looking at the Air Force

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:30.790 align:middle line:84%
people, and I'm glad I did that
because everybody down there,

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:34.296 align:middle line:84%
including Rudolph,
were all going--

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And I went, oh, they
hadn't seen that before.

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So I went on up
top, walked down,

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.430 align:middle line:90%
stepping over the vertebrates.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And inside the vertebrates
is a trunk case

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:50.780 align:middle line:84%
of some kind of fiber
wire looking stuff.

01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.270 align:middle line:10%
Today we would call
it fiber optics.

01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But inside the fiber optics
there's a liquid flowing.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Looks like MercuroChrome.

01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:00.260 align:middle line:90%
Y'all remember that?

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who don't remember
it, if you get a scratch,

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
let me put it on for you.

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
That stuff burns
like liquid fire.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.000 align:middle line:84%
But you never got an
infection, you noticed that?

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But your mother
come at you going--

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:15.480 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES DIABOLICALLY]

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.280 align:middle line:10%
God, I hate that stuff.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:18.650 align:middle line:90%
But it's a beautiful color.

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:20.570 align:middle line:90%
It's iridescent.

01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:23.005 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow,
that's the only stuff

01:11:23.005 --> 01:11:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I've ever seen other than
in a bottle, burn you up.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:26.870 align:middle line:90%
It's in this liquid.

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to go
down toward the center

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
where the two big
spheres meet, and that's

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:37.430 align:middle line:84%
where the figure eight
is being met up with.

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole thing's
configured in a figure

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.570 align:middle line:90%
eight pattern.

01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So I get down there and I
want to look over in the side.

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:49.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a hole about 4
and 1/2 feet in diameter.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And the stuff is blown inward.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So whatever the force was
came from the outside.

01:11:57.470 --> 01:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, metal
should be bent, and rigid,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and cut the heck out of
you if you touch it, right?

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, unfortunately,
I had the experience

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
to see a whale
harpooned, which has

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.230 align:middle line:90%
a grenade in the front of it.

01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
It goes inside the
whale and explodes.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:18.732 align:middle line:84%
Blow a hole five feet in
diameter inside of the whale.

01:12:18.732 --> 01:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's how
you kill a whale.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
With a harpoon.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an explosive charge.

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And that hole that I was looking
at looked just like a whale.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.450 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like blubber.

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And I reached down and
felt it, and it's smooth.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.830 align:middle line:84%
It's firm like
rubber, and not sharp.

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, man, what
is up with this thing?

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:44.230 align:middle line:90%
And I thought it was organic--

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
or inorganic-- the machine.

01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I saw the way
the flesh, or whatever

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that material was, and
now it looks organic.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:54.400 align:middle line:90%
So what is this thing?

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Inorganic or organic?

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:57.690 align:middle line:90%
Both?

01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of
hybrid, I guess.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I remembered
laying down on it

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and turning my head
inside to look,

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and there's a whole
compartment area.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, see, I know what it
should look like inside cause I

01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.460 align:middle line:90%
built one, right?

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So I get in there and there's
a partially blown seat

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.240 align:middle line:90%
that this force came through.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.440 align:middle line:84%
It was disintegrating
everything as it went through.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Came through the
outer and inner wall,

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
came through the compartment,
blew half the chair away.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But when it hit
the firewall, which

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.760 align:middle line:84%
is the inner wall
of the chamber,

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.940 align:middle line:84%
of the electric magnetic
field, it stopped.

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, how in
the hell did it do that?

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But the chair was built like
this chair I'm sitting in.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:53.670 align:middle line:84%
It's made for a
bipedal anthropoid.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
what's with that?

01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.642 align:middle line:84%
And I remember sitting down
in what was left of the chair.

01:14:00.642 --> 01:14:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
sat down, I looked

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
across the detonating
chamber where

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
the figure eight is, and there's
another station like this one.

01:14:08.730 --> 01:14:11.190 align:middle line:84%
One on each side,
left and right.

01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wow, maintenance
technicians must sit in here.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:24.510 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, no sooner I sat back
in the chair and settled down,

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:29.338 align:middle line:84%
panel rolls back, up comes
these two pods, domes.

01:14:29.338 --> 01:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And on top of the domes,
you've got these cutouts

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that look like that.

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
If you take your fingers,
that's the way it looked.

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And the hands were a little
bit bigger than mine.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'll just
put my hands in there.

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

01:14:44.130 --> 01:14:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did that,
I remember my mother saying,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
don't be sticking your hands
in things you don't know about.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.320 align:middle line:90%
God, my mother is right.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Because as soon as I
got my hands in there,

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.407 align:middle line:84%
there's these rings
that were interlocking

01:14:57.407 --> 01:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that just went chink,
chink, chink, all the way up

01:14:59.490 --> 01:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
to my top knuckles.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.038 align:middle line:84%
They got all 10 of my fingers,
and they're tightening down.

01:15:04.038 --> 01:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's going to
cut all 10 of my fingers off,

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
so I yell for help.

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Soon as I get a lung
full, get ready to go

01:15:10.170 --> 01:15:15.960 align:middle line:84%
help, a clear voice
says, David, be quiet.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.910 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of tight.

01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Can you loosen up?

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.550 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't let go.

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:26.197 align:middle line:90%
And now this thing--

01:15:26.197 --> 01:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I swear to God, the
voice sounded just

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:28.710 align:middle line:90%
like Lauren Bacall.

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:31.980 align:middle line:90%


01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to make
up for that, you know?

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> What a reward.

01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.380 align:middle line:90%
It got my attention.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was going ask her, I said,
you know where Humphrey is?

01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, she says,
sit still a minute.

01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:51.050 align:middle line:90%
This might hurt.

01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:53.135 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going-- first
thing went through my mind

01:15:53.135 --> 01:15:54.410 align:middle line:90%
is what the doctor says.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
This might be a
little uncomfortable.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:59.120 align:middle line:84%
Means it's going to hurt
like hell, you know?

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.680 align:middle line:90%
So I started tightening up.

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And you could feel it
coming up your arms.

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:04.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like liquid fire.

01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And it gets to right here
at the carotid artery.

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And, man, here comes
the light show.

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.150 align:middle line:90%
Just millions of images.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.400 align:middle line:90%
And your brain's on fire.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And where you can't feel
you're taking it anymore

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.170 align:middle line:90%
and just can't stand no more.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:20.840 align:middle line:90%
And my nose is bleeding.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I just go,
I can't take no more.

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Oh, good, cause we're
through, and it lets go.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, that was fun.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.740 align:middle line:90%


01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
It's what we said on
a panel earlier today.

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:39.700 align:middle line:90%
It was a download of some kind.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
It was something coming in.

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know how
much came in until later.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Months and years later.

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Then you start realizing,
what did that thing do to you?

01:16:55.270 --> 01:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
It downloaded-- I
guess it's like--

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.680 align:middle line:90%
better lack of words.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Mr. Spock had it right.

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:05.470 align:middle line:90%
Katra.

01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Its entire essence.

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything it ever
knew in its life.

01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Except these things are
a little bit old, y'all.

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:17.600 align:middle line:84%
They're over eight
billion years old.

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.610 align:middle line:84%
More than half the life
of the entire universe.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's the oldest
thing I ever heard of.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So if you imagine a race
1,000 years ahead of you,

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
how about eight
billion years ahead?

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I was worried, and
it was worried, I might leak.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So I get out, crawl
up-- and I thought

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
I was there for like five hours,
and Rudolph didn't say anything

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:51.892 align:middle line:90%
when I came out.

01:17:51.892 --> 01:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what did you
think of the damaged area?

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And I went, it's messed up.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of force definitely
blasted into this thing.

01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So I came up, and then you
have this rhetoric between us,

01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:08.830 align:middle line:90%
which was--

01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:12.330 align:middle line:90%
it just set me off.

01:18:12.330 --> 01:18:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I was much more aggressive
when I came out.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:18.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like you suddenly
figured out what's going on.

01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
It's not good.

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
You're being lied
to something fierce.

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's hard for--

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:29.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm 17 years old, y'all.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm starting to realize
the government's lied to us.

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:37.230 align:middle line:84%
How much more
betrayal have you got?

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:40.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used to go to
sleep listening to Anita Bryant

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.910 align:middle line:90%
records.

01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:43.030 align:middle line:90%
That bad off.

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Had an American
flag for a blanket.

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Now all that is shattered.

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing there
and they're asking me,

01:18:50.610 --> 01:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
can you help us figure
out how this works?

01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Well, you built it.

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.688 align:middle line:84%
How come you don't
know how it works?

01:18:55.688 --> 01:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, the people
who's working on it,

01:18:57.230 --> 01:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
they're on vacation like you're
on summer vacation right now.

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:01.190 align:middle line:90%
They're on vacation.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's nice.

01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Did they leave any notes?

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.080 align:middle line:84%
They took it with them because
they have homework like you do.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there
going, can you believe this?

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm where I'm at and they're
talking to me like this.

01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And I just suddenly
got really angry.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
this is not ours.

01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not theirs-- the Soviets.

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not even from the
neighborhood, is it?

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, and I said, how
long have you had this thing?

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Did you dig it up when you
were digging this place out?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, what did
you do with all the dirt?

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they got really
mad about that one.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Never thought I'd make
anyone get mad over dirt.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.290 align:middle line:90%
But where did all the dirt go?

01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was really angry, and
then Rudolph told me, get down.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:45.600 align:middle line:90%
So I'm coming down.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.830 align:middle line:84%
As I'm getting down, I put
my hands on the smooth parts.

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just red and
fiery wherever I touch.

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And that catches my attention.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:54.980 align:middle line:90%
I stop.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.590 align:middle line:90%
You know, what's wrong with you?

01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm fascinated by the
interaction, I calm down.

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It goes from the red
back to the blue.

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, it's not
heat recognition alloy.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.350 align:middle line:90%
This thing is like a mood stone.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:14.720 align:middle line:90%
It's picking up your feelings.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This whole thing's operated by
some kind of feeling mechanism.

01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So I got down and looked
down at him again.

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's mouth-- yeah.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Y'all haven't seen this before.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So I get back on the
back of the golf cart

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
and we go back upstairs.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
We're on our way to Pitholem
and I hear them whispering.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But, see, these
giant brains aren't

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.230 align:middle line:90%
thinking about something.

01:20:45.230 --> 01:20:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They're up at the
front whispering.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:47.990 align:middle line:90%
We're driving that way.

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm at the back.

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:51.020 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:52.640 align:middle line:90%
Wind.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Sound carries on wind.

01:20:54.650 --> 01:20:56.553 align:middle line:90%
Their whispers are right here.

01:20:56.553 --> 01:20:57.720 align:middle line:90%
I can hear them really good.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking
out the back, so I

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.875 align:middle line:90%
act like I don't hear anything.

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And I hear them whispering.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
They're going, we
got to get this kid

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:04.752 align:middle line:90%
to help us with this thing.

01:21:04.752 --> 01:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're not going to
get it functional fast enough

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:08.700 align:middle line:90%
to get first strike.

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:09.500 align:middle line:90%
First strike?

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting
there going, what,

01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
are they playing baseball
down here or what?

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:16.040 align:middle line:90%
What is first strike?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.300 align:middle line:90%
And then they said, you know--

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:19.100 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
They said, well,
we're going to have

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to get it done so we can finish
the game with the Russkies.

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going, Rus--

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Russians.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
nuclear weapons.

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So they want-- what
they want is my engine.

01:21:33.930 --> 01:21:36.060 align:middle line:90%
How fast was it?

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:40.080 align:middle line:90%
125, 126 miles, 3.2 seconds?

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that with a
warhead on the end of it.

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And the other-- that's
part A. Part B, LeMay

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.730 align:middle line:84%
was going to replace all
B-52s with the XB-70.

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:54.910 align:middle line:90%
The Valkyrie.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of you've seen
that on the internet.

01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
A delta wing bomber, built and
designed in 1958 at Area 51.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And it cruises at 85,000
feet at 2,000 miles an hour.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.470 align:middle line:90%
1958.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
We ain't got today nothing to
do that, that altitude or speed.

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Can't get there.

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were going
to put Pitholem

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
inside of the Valkyrie.

01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, go into fail-safe
into edge of Soviet Union.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Drop Pitholem out.

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.168 align:middle line:90%
Off it goes.

01:22:30.168 --> 01:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Soviets look at their
scopes and go, what's that?

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:35.280 align:middle line:10%
By time they get to
what, blinding flash,

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.210 align:middle line:10%
and they're gone.

01:22:37.210 --> 01:22:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Burnt to a crisp.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:43.780 align:middle line:84%
You win MAD, Mutual Assured
Destruction, by first strike.

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:46.540 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is mad
because you've got--

01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
what a perfect name
for the program.

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I asked them, I said,
well, what about the subs?

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Oh, we'll lose 30%,
35% of the population,

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.640 align:middle line:90%
but we find that acceptable.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Not if you're in
the 30%, you're not.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.210 align:middle line:90%
And it's just how they think.

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.290 align:middle line:90%
It's just madness, y'all.

01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:08.740 align:middle line:90%
And it hasn't changed a bit.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.370 align:middle line:90%
So I realize I've got to--

01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:15.970 align:middle line:84%
now I've got to take
out my own rocket.

01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I've got to blow it
into a million pieces.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
How do you blow up
a top secret rocket

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
on a top secret military
base that doesn't exist?

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, and
you're 17 years old.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.090 align:middle line:90%
Can we make this any harder?

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So anyhow, I looked
out the hangar doors,

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and I start complaining I'll
never get to see my rocket.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So Rudolph said, take
him out see the rocket.

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And I had my hand in the hub of
the wheel of the hangar door.

01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:46.800 align:middle line:90%
Graphite grease.

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Got a wad of it.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.710 align:middle line:84%
So we take off, we get
out there to see Pitholem,

01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:53.270 align:middle line:84%
and I told the
guards, stay back.

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:54.930 align:middle line:90%
The thing might be leaking.

01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:55.848 align:middle line:90%
They don't leak.

01:23:55.848 --> 01:23:57.140 align:middle line:90%
Well, anyway, they didn't know.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
They were happy to
stay in the cart.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
So I open up the
side panels, get in,

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and drop in the graphite grease
into the induction chambers.

01:24:06.230 --> 01:24:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Ask any physicist
what happens when

01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:13.520 align:middle line:84%
graphite grease meets deuterium
at the speed of light.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.540 align:middle line:90%
It's violent, y'all.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.550 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I tell the guards,
this thing's going to blow up.

01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:21.140 align:middle line:90%
It's leaking.

01:24:21.140 --> 01:24:22.580 align:middle line:84%
So I get in the
cart and run off,

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're heading
back to the hangar.

01:24:24.710 --> 01:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the guard asked
a really good question

01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:28.860 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think about.

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:29.840 align:middle line:90%
What's a safe distance?

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.830 align:middle line:90%


01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:38.700 align:middle line:84%
What if thing goes nuclear
and we're in Nevada?

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him
and I said, Chicago.

01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:44.260 align:middle line:90%
He goes, god.

01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.260 align:middle line:90%
We take off.

01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:49.870 align:middle line:10%
And it did not go
nuclear, but it blew--

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:52.160 align:middle line:10%
Pitholem blew into
in a billion pieces.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
The biggest piece they found was
about the size of my thumbnail.

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:58.675 align:middle line:84%
So all my stuff
back at the lab, I

01:24:58.675 --> 01:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
had worked it out with my
dad on a telephone call.

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:02.840 align:middle line:10%
Skipped some stuff.

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.030 align:middle line:10%
Dad burned everything
in the lab.

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:07.550 align:middle line:84%
All the paperwork's gone,
all the models are gone,

01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and the prototype's gone.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.950 align:middle line:90%
The only thing left is me.

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
Rudolph got violent.

01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:17.030 align:middle line:10%
And he looked at
me and he said--

01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:18.480 align:middle line:10%
show you how smart he was.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:19.560 align:middle line:10%
He's looking at me.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:20.935 align:middle line:10%
He asked the guard
what happened.

01:25:20.935 --> 01:25:22.290 align:middle line:10%
He said it was leaking.

01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:26.910 align:middle line:10%
And there's this huge
explosion hole out there.

01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:30.448 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at me, grabs
my hand and looked at it,

01:25:30.448 --> 01:25:31.740 align:middle line:90%
then looked at the hangar door.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And he went-- you know, it was
almost like from "Laugh-In,"

01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:39.750 align:middle line:90%
you know, very smart.

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:41.500 align:middle line:90%
He's very clever.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he hit me so
hard he knocked my lower

01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:46.180 align:middle line:90%
teeth through my lip.

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.510 align:middle line:90%
It was sticking out.

01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:48.900 align:middle line:90%
I was trying to get my lip off.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm spitting blood.

01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm on all fours
looking at the floor.

01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.780 align:middle line:90%
I hear all these guns cocking.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm going, this is just great.

01:25:57.460 --> 01:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And I look up, and all the Air
Force people got their guns

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.360 align:middle line:90%
at Rudolph's head.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started thinking
about something.

01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The World War II only
ended a couple decades ago.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
These guys fathers
were fighting him,

01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:15.330 align:middle line:84%
or some of the older guards
may have fought him himself.

01:26:15.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And now you just had a
gestapo slap a Midwest farm

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:23.040 align:middle line:84%
kid in the mouth
and he's bleeding,

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and they didn't like that.

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So I looked up and I went,
well, maybe, Rudolph,

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:30.180 align:middle line:84%
you're not in charge as
much as you think you are.

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So these other guys in the
black suits pick me up,

01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.600 align:middle line:90%
take me back to a room.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.400 align:middle line:90%
No windows.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
Just a bulb hanging from a wire.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:38.970 align:middle line:90%
And there they locked the door.

01:26:38.970 --> 01:26:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And Rudolph showed me
something on the way in.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.000 align:middle line:84%
A 17-year-old body, his
dental records been altered,

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.368 align:middle line:84%
and that's been burnt to
a crisp, and that's me.

01:26:48.368 --> 01:26:50.160 align:middle line:84%
They're going to send
it back to my parents

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and say I was killed
at White Sands,

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be here for
the rest of my life.

01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And that is horrifying.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.220 align:middle line:84%
The only funny scene
I saw about that

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.400 align:middle line:84%
was Brent Spiner in
"Independence Day."

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't get out
much, Mr. President.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.470 align:middle line:90%
You know, that was my future.

01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:09.540 align:middle line:90%
I was going to be there forever.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And they slammed door and
lock it, and there I sat.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And about eight hours
later, there's a big ruckus,

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and the door flies open,
and there's a huge figure

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:24.680 align:middle line:90%
with a stogie going like this.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And he's got the Colonel
of the base by the tie

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and bouncing his head
against the wall.

01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:32.742 align:middle line:90%
And he said, did you do that?

01:27:32.742 --> 01:27:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, no,
we didn't do that.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Rudolph did it.

01:27:35.210 --> 01:27:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Well, where's he at?

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:37.382 align:middle line:90%
He just left when you got here.

01:27:37.382 --> 01:27:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, go get him.

01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:42.810 align:middle line:90%
So meantime, clean him up.

01:27:42.810 --> 01:27:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Put him on my plane.

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So General LeMay showed up, and
he got me out of Groom Lake.

01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Flew me all the way back
to Wright-Patterson.

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.687 align:middle line:90%
And he told me, be ready.

01:27:52.687 --> 01:27:53.520 align:middle line:90%
They're not through.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:55.560 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
keep coming at you.

01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.200 align:middle line:84%
The only edge you've got is that
you've destroyed everything.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't build another rocket.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, I had--

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:06.580 align:middle line:84%
the Air Force car took
me from Wright-Patterson

01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:10.230 align:middle line:84%
back to Mount Vernon
and back at my house.

01:28:10.230 --> 01:28:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And I remember next week
I had to go to school

01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and the English
teacher asked me,

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
what did you do on
your summer vacation?

01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:19.530 align:middle line:90%
Write that up.

01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And I told them, I
worked at Pizza Hut.

01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:26.130 align:middle line:90%
So that was nuts.

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:28.500 align:middle line:90%
Things were quiet that fall.

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.440 align:middle line:90%
Then winter rolled around.

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Quiet spring.

01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Graduating high school.

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I've now graduated.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm in cap and gown, shaking
hands with the parents

01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:39.750 align:middle line:90%
as they go by.

01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And telling them, yeah, I'm
going to Ohio State University.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Got a full scholarship.

01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Theoretical astrophysics.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.040 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, grabbed this hand
while I'm talking to parent,

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's ice cold,
man, like it's dead.

01:28:54.590 --> 01:28:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And I look-- two guys in black
suits with mirrored sunglasses.

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And they just hand me this
paper and I open it up,

01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:03.870 align:middle line:90%
and it says, greetings.

01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:05.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm drafted.

01:29:05.850 --> 01:29:07.380 align:middle line:90%
It's June 1972.

01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Draft didn't shut
down till when?

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:10.440 align:middle line:90%
1975.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:11.370 align:middle line:90%
They grab me.

01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:12.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my cap and gown.

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
They drag me across the
parking lot, throw me in a car,

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:16.980 align:middle line:90%
screaming parents.

01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And on that video
over here, they

01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:22.990 align:middle line:90%
found my high school classmates.

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.105 align:middle line:84%
And they wonder,
where did he go?

01:29:25.105 --> 01:29:25.905 align:middle line:90%
He disappeared.

01:29:25.905 --> 01:29:28.470 align:middle line:10%
And with some guy
yelling at his parents

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:29.970 align:middle line:10%
about legal conscription?

01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.850 align:middle line:90%
And I'm gone.

01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I end up at Port Columbus.

01:29:35.340 --> 01:29:37.650 align:middle line:90%
We have another standoff there.

01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:40.770 align:middle line:84%
I ask Colonel
Williams to calm down.

01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:43.110 align:middle line:84%
He's pulling all these
guns on the guys in suits.

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They pulled their guns.

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:48.490 align:middle line:84%
It's now the CIA versus the Air
Force, and I'm in a tug of war.

01:29:48.490 --> 01:29:51.240 align:middle line:84%
So I tell Colonel Williams,
just drop your guns and go home.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Let everybody go home
to their families.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.490 align:middle line:90%
I'll go with these guys.

01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:58.510 align:middle line:84%
So I end up in Langley,
Virginia, home of the CIA.

01:29:58.510 --> 01:30:00.660 align:middle line:10%
And I'm in this medical room.

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:03.480 align:middle line:10%
And I turn around, door
opens, and guess who walks in?

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Arthur Rudolph.

01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:07.880 align:middle line:90%
With all of his lab friends.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And they throw this
table back, the covers,

01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and it's all these
needles and jars.

01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at the bottles,
sodium pentothal, sodium

01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:17.200 align:middle line:90%
barbital.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, man.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.950 align:middle line:90%
It's all of the "tal" family.

01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So they stick it in
my vein right here,

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:26.870 align:middle line:90%
and it was like liquid fire.

01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered the last
thing was going out and--

01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:35.430 align:middle line:84%
you're only supposed to be
under 30 minutes for this stuff.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I remember coming to and
listening and I said,

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
he's been under
two days, Rudolph.

01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
If you gave him anymore,
he's going to be an eggplant.

01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:45.520 align:middle line:90%
And he said, I don't care.

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.850 align:middle line:90%
They put me back under.

01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Two more days.

01:30:47.650 --> 01:30:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Four days I was
under this stuff.

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:51.950 align:middle line:84%
They did not get
what they wanted.

01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:53.262 align:middle line:90%
Still pissed off.

01:30:53.262 --> 01:30:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big
argument in the hallway.

01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
I hear more rumbling
around out there.

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm assuming it was LeMay.

01:31:00.130 --> 01:31:01.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to see.

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:04.778 align:middle line:84%
They said, you're
going to Camp Lejeune.

01:31:04.778 --> 01:31:06.070 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be in the army.

01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:07.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll send you to Vietnam.

01:31:07.210 --> 01:31:08.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll be dead.

01:31:08.650 --> 01:31:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Then they came back and
said, can you work on jets?

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.490 align:middle line:90%
I said, sure.

01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:19.240 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to Millington,
Tennessee, joining the US Navy,

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and start off there.

01:31:20.410 --> 01:31:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I end
up in the United States

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Navy for the next 11 years.

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So that day cost
me a little bit.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I never got to go to college.

01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:35.420 align:middle line:84%
I was 40 years old when
I got my first degree.

01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.090 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, that's where it is.

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:41.440 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.667 align:middle line:90%
