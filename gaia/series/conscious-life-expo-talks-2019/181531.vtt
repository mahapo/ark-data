00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.471 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:23.292 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to be here.

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:24.092 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.964 align:middle line:90%
Conscious Life Expo 2019.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:35.221 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Oy, yoy, yoy.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
One of these expos will be in
orbit somewhere around Jupiter,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.445 align:middle line:90%
hopefully soon.

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:56.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:90%
I am so glad to be here.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.720 align:middle line:84%
It's taken a lot for me
to be here this year.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:10%
So, like, I am--

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.010 align:middle line:10%
you know, because
it's been crazy busy.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.660 align:middle line:10%
I don't know about your lives.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:10%
But everything seems to
be accelerating right now.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:26.240 align:middle line:10%
And you know, with acceleration
comes heat and friction.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And you know, as I
usually say, it's

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
all about friction
and fluid dynamics.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So tonight, we get a
little bit of the fluid.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.800 align:middle line:90%
We get the juices going, right?

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Some lubrification of the
mind and some experiencing.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm really, really, really
excited to present tonight

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
a paper that just passed
peer review two days ago

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.145 align:middle line:84%
and was accepted
for publication.

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.436 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.105 align:middle line:90%
It's so exciting.

00:02:15.105 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Here it is, in the Journal of
Scientific Research publishing.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the journal
itself, I believe,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is High Energy
Physics, Gravitation,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:90%
and Quantum Physics?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:90%
Quantum Cosmology.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's published with
Dr. Amira Val Baker.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Val Baker in the house.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Come over here.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.210 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Come over here.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about it.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:02:55.978 --> 00:02:59.866 align:middle line:90%
Oh, oh, oh.

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about it?

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:90%
- How long did it take?

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It took four years to do.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, it took actually--

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
so I met Nassim
about four years ago.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And he said, can you--

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
we were going to write
this paper together.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And it took about six months.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:90%
But then things happened.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And then something
else happened.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was annoying because
it kept taking so long.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But in a way, it was good,
because along the way,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
we found all these other
scientific results that

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:90%
came out.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:90%
And that added to it.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And so now, it's
better than it could

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
have been if all those
obstacles hadn't happened.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:90%
So it was good.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Good job.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:90%
So I'm really excited about it.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:10%
It sounds a little,
you know, catastrophic.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:90%
But it's a good thing.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.600 align:middle line:84%
The title of the paper
is "Resolving the Vacuum

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Catastrophe, a Generalized
Holographic Approach."

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go through it
a little bit together tonight.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And the reason this talk is
called "The Universe and You"

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.063 align:middle line:84%
is that by resolving this
problem in physics, which is

00:04:24.063 --> 00:04:25.355 align:middle line:90%
called the vacuum catastrophe--

00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Actually, another part of our
team is Oliver over there.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Olivier Alirol is a
physicist from France.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.768 align:middle line:90%
Olivier, stand up.

00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Part of our team.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And on our way here,
my van, which I'm

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:90%
a single dad half the time.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:10%
So my van had the traces
of my kids all over.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:10%
And so we tried to clean it
up real quick on the way here.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.872 align:middle line:90%
But we had a vacuum catastrophe.

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it was very
serendipitous to what

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to present tonight.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:10%
It's a different kind of
vacuum, but it sucks as well.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And it really is about
a fundamental issue

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that has occurred in physics as
a result of the physics we've

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.000 align:middle line:90%
written over the past century.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's a catastrophe because it
doesn't agree from one scale

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It has a scale at
the quantum level,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
at the atomic level, at
the level of all the atoms

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
that makes up you,
that says something

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
very fundamental,
very deep, something

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
that says that
spacetime is quantized,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:90%
that spacetime is discrete.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
this catastrophe

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
that happens as you grow
the system towards planets,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and stars, and
galaxies, and universes,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.810 align:middle line:90%
where the math don't add up.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.180 align:middle line:10%
They don't not just a
little bit don't add up.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.800 align:middle line:84%
They really, really, really,
really, really, really

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:90%
don't add up.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
Because the vacuum catastrophe
is the largest oh shit moment

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%
in physics ever.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a discrepancy of
122 orders of magnitude.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.350 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.455 align:middle line:10%
So you know, so
people understand--

00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, orders of magnitudes,
they're exponential,

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.440 align:middle line:10%
so it's a lot.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It's-- a lot doesn't
quite cut it.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, like, when you add
zeros in your bank account,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:90%
you--

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.350 align:middle line:90%
You have four zeros after the 1.

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK, you can maybe,
you know, in California maybe

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.140 align:middle line:90%
you can gas your car.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
If you have five
zeros, it's better.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
If you add another
0, now, at six zeros,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
it's starting to get
real good, right?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But every zero you
add, it changes a lot.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
If you add another is 0,
like, seven, eight zeros,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:90%
it's like, whoa.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
122 zeros, it's big.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And so if you-- imagine,
you're writing your equation.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And you end up at the
end of the equation,

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and you're off by, like, 122
zeros, it's really not good.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So this has been
something that physicists

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:90%
have been struggling with.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
it's the difference

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:90%
between the density--

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum density at the
quantum level and the vacuum

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
density at the universal
level, the universal density.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.515 align:middle line:84%
So let me explain
what that means.

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this was accepted just now.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is a new presentation.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
have to bear with me.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There might be a few
of those moments.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So I want to go to a place
because I just want to say--

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
how many people
here know my work?

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.060 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you've seen me
throughout the years talking

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.050 align:middle line:84%
about, space is not empty,
the vacuum is full of energy,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
quantum fluctuations
are occurring,

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:90%
we can write physics on this.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.620 align:middle line:10%
Maybe instead of ignoring
this for 100 years,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:10%
maybe we should actually start
realizing that's probably

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:10%
the source of everything.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.700 align:middle line:10%
You know?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:10%
Since it's very much
high energy intensity

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:10%
in the vacuum and
the whole thing.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.490 align:middle line:90%
So you've heard me say all this.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, recently, in 2017, but
I discovered it only recently,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw what I believed
to be one of the most critical,

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
the most inspired, the
most fundamental thought

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:90%
talk in physics I've ever seen.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.265 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen a lot of
physics talks, a lot.

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, like,
trying to stay awake

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:45.660 align:middle line:84%
after days and days of
listening to data and like,

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and then the square root of
this over this da, da, da, da.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But nothing is more
fundamental than this talk that

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
was given by a brilliant,
brilliant physicist, Frank

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Wilczek, Nobel Prize winner
in physics, a talk that

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:90%
was titled the material--

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:90%
The talk is called--

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.420 align:middle line:90%
mmm, do I have it on the slide?

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:90%
"The Materiality of the Vacuum."

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:84%
The Materiality of the
Vacuum," I'm sorry.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.540 align:middle line:90%
I had a senior moment.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens after
30 years of physics.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been talking about
the materiality of the vacuum

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:90%
all this time.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Wilczek discussed it so
directly, so bluntly,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.840 align:middle line:90%
so clearly.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:90%
It's such an amazing talk.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a big step
for the scientific community

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:90%
to start talking this way.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot of
spine for a physicist

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
with the background
of Frank Wilczek

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:90%
to start talking this way.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:90%
So I really want to honor him.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:90%
He's a brilliant man.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And here is a little
bit of his discussion.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
A vacuum, to us in
physics, people commonly

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
talk about a vacuum as what you
get if you remove everything

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:42.140 align:middle line:84%
you can easily or even
with a lot of effort.

he's meaning is, like,

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
he's not talking about
the vacuum, like,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:01.200 align:middle line:84%
your vacuum cleaner, or a vacuum
chamber in a laboratory where

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:84%
you tried to remove
a lot of this stuff.

- But that, we've
learned, doesn't

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
deserve to be called
empty because it

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
contains a lot of structure,
a lot of activity.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And we can't
understand the behavior

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:84%
of the things we do see
if we don't ascribe space

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:90%
itself those properties.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.935 align:middle line:90%

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know,
after all these years

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
of talking this
way, it really is

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
heartwarming to hear that level
of physicist talking this way.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Here's another extract.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.773 align:middle line:84%
- To put it another way, again,
it's a vacuum is not void.

00:13:51.773 --> 00:13:52.573 align:middle line:90%
Void.

00:13:52.573 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Void.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.210 align:middle line:10%
- Now, I want to ask--

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:10%
- The absence of particles,
the absence of excitations,

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:10%
is not the absence of structure.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only is it that he's
saying that space is not empty

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not a void, he's
saying not only is it not empty

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's not a void,
but it's structured.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.600 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:90%
It has structure.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
It has materiality.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:90%
It has a function in reality.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Because most of the
time, in physics,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
this energy and the
structure of space

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.210 align:middle line:84%
that you're bathing in
right now, that you're

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
made of-- you're made of
99.9999999% space, right?

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.750 align:middle line:84%
That energy's in
you right now has

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
been ignored because it's
been thought that it was just

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:56.710 align:middle line:84%
completely chaotic, stochastic,
completely incapable

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.320 align:middle line:90%
of producing structure.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And as you saw throughout the
years, as I wrote my equations,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:10%
I showed that not only is
it producing structure,

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:10%
but the structure it produced
is what we call matter,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:10%
is what we call reality.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It's what we call you.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So there comes the
most beautiful part

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:90%
of Wilczek's discussion.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.300 align:middle line:10%
- This is another example.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So in that very strong sense,
we are ethereal beings.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We are children
of the ether, just

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
as fish are children of
the water, if you like,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and citizens of Siliconia
would be children of silicon.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:54.316 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:15:54.316 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Remember me throughout
the years giving the example

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:10%
of a fish in the water would
never know there's water?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.040 align:middle line:10%
Like, if there's
water everywhere,

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't know it's there.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:90%
He talks about this.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
He talks about
people of Siliconia,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:22.090 align:middle line:84%
if there was silica everywhere,
if space was a crystal,

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
nobody would know that
space is a crystal

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:90%
because it would be everywhere.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And to them, it would
be like nothing.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:30.884 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And he used that example because
a crystal has structure and can

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:90%
propagate--

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:90%
information can propagate.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Energy can propagate.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
Wave form can oscillate, can
propagate phonons and so on.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So he gives this
example in his talk.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.090 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.090 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So this is remarkable from Mr.
Wilczek telling us literally,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:84%
from the mainstream,
not from me,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:90%
we are children of the ether.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.754 align:middle line:10%
We are ethereal beings.

00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:12.554 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:15.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.859 align:middle line:84%
That's like let that sink,
because the world is changing,

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:90%
folks.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.159 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's changing.

00:17:24.159 --> 00:17:27.160 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:90%
The opening is happening, right?

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if we get all
these guys behind us,

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
now, we're going to
have some serious push,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.890 align:middle line:90%
some serious power.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So here, we saw throughout
the years that--

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:56.430 align:middle line:84%
I used this energy to
describe the material world.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:10%
The structure of space,
the dynamic of space

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:10.370 align:middle line:10%
that creates everything we
see is actually not something

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:11.660 align:middle line:10%
that--

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:10%
it's something you
can philosophize about

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:10%
and you can talk about,
but you can actually

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:10%
write physics on it.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.366 align:middle line:90%
You really can.

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:90%
You can quantify it.

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And you can quantify it
because it's pixilated.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
That means that it's quantized.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:10%
That means that, at
the very fine level,

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:10%
there's little bits
of information that

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:42.570 align:middle line:10%
are very specific,
they are quantifiable.

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
like wow, it's cool,

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:90%
it's like a fluid whatever.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
you can count.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
can write physics on.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It's something that you can
extrapolate and calculate,

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
compute, and see if it
matches our reality.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And it does.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
are familiar with

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
my holographic mass solution?

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:10%
So basically, what
I've done is that I've

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:32.920 align:middle line:10%
shown that this ether, this
structure of space itself,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:10%
is the source of the material
world, the source of the nuclei

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:10%
of atoms and the electron,
that if I take a proton,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and I count how many of
these little pixels--

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:10%
So spacetime has
these little pixels.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And if I count these
little pixels--

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.220 align:middle line:84%
they're called Planck
Spherical Units.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:10%
And the reason this was
not discovered earlier

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:07.220 align:middle line:10%
is because the typical way
the equations were written

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:10%
is that they were written
in Planck squares and Planck

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.870 align:middle line:10%
cubes.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And guess what.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.620 align:middle line:84%
The universe is just
not making cubed pixels.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.870 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It's not doing that, right?

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:38.270 align:middle line:84%
It exists, then go for,
like, the typical application

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:90%
of our computers.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
It did a little bit
better than that.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:90%
It made spheres, right?

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So I clearly took this
fundamental value.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is a Planck
pixel fundamental?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:10%
It's fundamental because
if a photon is moving,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.530 align:middle line:10%
you can imagine that it
can have long wavelengths.

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
When it's moving, it can
have very long wavelengths.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And these wavelengths
would be in the space

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:90%
everywhere around us.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.900 align:middle line:90%
We know there's radio waves.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.760 align:middle line:90%
We know there's microwaves.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.520 align:middle line:10%
There's all kinds of stuff
in the space around us.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But then, there
would be wavelengths

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that are getting shorter and
shorter and shorter and shorter

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and shorter and shorter, and
with the frequency going up.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Wah!

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.027 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's going up, the
shorter, shorter, shorter,

00:21:32.027 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:90%
shorter, shorter, shorter.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
the distance

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:44.370 align:middle line:84%
that a photon would travel
to go across the wavelength

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
would be faster than
the speed of light.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It reaches the speed of light.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.190 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And at that speed, then
it has that length.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
That wavelength is the
shortest wavelength

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
a photon can travel
for that distance.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.425 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
So there's a lower limit.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, am I saying that
the speed of light

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:90%
is the limit of the universe?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Or that the Planck length is the
smallest thing in the universe?

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is a lower
limit for our universe

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:31.210 align:middle line:90%
and our experience.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:32.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
From our scale, our
relationship to the universe

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:90%
will be the speed of light.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's not an ultimate
speed limit.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It's only a boundary
condition to our experience,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
just like the speed
of sound is a boundary

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:90%
experience to our ear.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we break it,
we hear it, right?

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:07.360 align:middle line:90%
We go through the sound wall.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.632 align:middle line:84%
So that little pixel is
then the fundamental pixel

00:23:14.632 --> 00:23:19.560 align:middle line:84%
of our universe relative to
the size of our universe.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
If our universe had
a different size,

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the pixel size
would be different.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, because of our
universe having this size,

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and because of everything
in our universe

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:84%
expanding at the same
time, then the relationship

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.100 align:middle line:90%
stays the same.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So the pixel size has
the carrying capacity

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.560 align:middle line:84%
of our universe because it's
a harmonic relationship.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.900 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is
one bloody thing.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not like this
is that, and this

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:90%
is that, because we do that.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We make boundaries.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.700 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we make boundaries
in science where we say,

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
this is biology, and this is
physics, and this is chemistry,

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and this is psychology.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is-- do you
think the universe thinks

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:90%
of itself that way?

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.370 align:middle line:90%
Probably not, right?

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:10%
It probably doesn't go,
oh, this is physics,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:10%
and this is biology.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:10%
So then there are
completely different rules.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.250 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't do that.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:44.550 align:middle line:10%
It's a continuum.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
It goes from the Planck
pixel, from the foundation

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
of creation to the whole
universe in one swoop

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:90%
continuum.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:03.320 align:middle line:10%
And we make the division
because of our tendency

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:10%
to want to categorize
and analyze.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:10%
And then when we do
that-- that's a good thing

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:10%
to do if we want to understand
the detail of a certain thing,

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:10%
of a certain scale.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:10%
But if we forget
that that's connected

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.400 align:middle line:10%
to all of the rest
of the stuff, then we

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.320 align:middle line:10%
lose the global picture, the
universal picture of what

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.720 align:middle line:10%
we're trying to understand.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So then it becomes
discontinuous, disconnected.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.300 align:middle line:90%
And we don't understand.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
We lose pieces.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
We understand details very
well in very specific parts,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
but we don't understand
how it all works together.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.140 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, we say, this
is the electromagnetic field,

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:90%
and this is gravity.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.955 align:middle line:84%
And this is mass,
and this is charge.

00:25:57.955 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And we think that these things
are all different things.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
But they're just the same
thing acting in different ways

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:90%
in different circumstances.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
It's one thing.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
It's like Janis Joplin, you
know, it's all one big deal,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.740 align:middle line:90%
man.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not separate.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:44.180 align:middle line:84%
It's one continuum
that's in a process.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.570 align:middle line:84%
So clearly, I took, the
surface of a proton.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, well, how many
Plancks are on the surface?

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.050 align:middle line:84%
How much information is on
the surface of this system?

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
How much information is on the
surface of this system in terms

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:90%
of these little pixels?

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a lot of little
pixels, a lot, 10 to the 40th.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:90%
That's 10 with 40 zeros.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a big number.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:13.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.270 align:middle line:90%
On the surface.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
surface of a proton.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, a proton is
pretty dang small.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:10%
It's actually, like,
insanely small already.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.680 align:middle line:84%
You're made out of
100 trillion cells.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.420 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Each cell is made out
of 100 trillion atoms.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.130 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
Like, integrate that.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.485 align:middle line:84%
100 trillion multiplied
by 100 trillion.

00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:50.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And that's the thing.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, that's all
happening right now.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.330 align:middle line:10%
And like, it's happening
very, very well.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:59.270 align:middle line:10%
It's not confused.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.070 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.250 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.520 align:middle line:90%
It's highly structured.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
If it got confused, even for,
like, a billionth of a second,

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:15.450 align:middle line:84%
you would have a very,
very, very bad day.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.290 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't take long, and
things would go very wrong.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:29.250 align:middle line:84%
There's I think 1,000 billion
billion chemical changes

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:84%
every second to run the
100 trillion cells that

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.890 align:middle line:84%
are in your body that are
dividing at the million cells

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:44.710 align:middle line:84%
a second, just so
you can be here.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what's
this guy saying?

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.190 align:middle line:10%
This is incredible, right?

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.500 align:middle line:90%
This is non--

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, imagine.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:84%
The amount of
information transfer

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
that must happen during
that time for you

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:90%
to continue to be here--

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and you know, most of us, we
don't think about it twice.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We take it completely
for granted.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
We're just like, god damn,
what is this crazy experience

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm having?

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:90%
It's like we go to work.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.670 align:middle line:10%
We come back from work.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.240 align:middle line:10%
We do this thing.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:10%
We do this whole life.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.270 align:middle line:10%
It just blew my mind
all my childhood.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I would, like, sit in the bus.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I kept on getting kicked out of
the school closest to my home.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.900 align:middle line:84%
So I was furthering
my education then.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to go
further and further.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I would sit in
the bus, and I would just

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.770 align:middle line:90%
look at the people in the bus.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be wondering, like,
do any of these people

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.670 align:middle line:84%
wonder how they even
got in this bus?

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.040 align:middle line:84%
What is this thing
you're experiencing?

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Because most people,
they just get born,

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:18.280 align:middle line:84%
and then they do what
people tell them to do.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And then they just do
that all their life.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.180 align:middle line:10%
And then at the
end of their life,

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.360 align:middle line:10%
maybe in the last few weeks,
when they get told, like,

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.660 align:middle line:10%
you're kind of like out
of luck, like, it's--

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.052 align:middle line:10%


00:30:33.052 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:10%
talk to your family, and--

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.700 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe then, they go,
oh, what was this I just

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.300 align:middle line:90%
did for the last 80 years?

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.980 align:middle line:90%
What was that all about?

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.320 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It's like, shit, I only have
two weeks to figure it out.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.302 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:58.302 --> 00:31:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.800 align:middle line:90%
So that always blew my mind.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I was like, is nobody asking,
like, what the heck is this?

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:90%
They call it reality.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Pretty surreal to me.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.000 align:middle line:90%
And then it's like--

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.260 align:middle line:90%
for me, it was OK.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.040 align:middle line:84%
But then when you realize
the miracle it is--

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.950 align:middle line:84%
so now you have this
highly organized system.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you calculate how
fast the organization

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:40.200 align:middle line:84%
for a human being to happen,
just one, in 13.7 billion years

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:45.390 align:middle line:84%
since the so-called Big Bang
it's like, it doesn't add up.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't add up, like,
not anywhere close.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.250 align:middle line:90%
It's too complex.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.270 align:middle line:10%
Like, if it was all random--

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:10%
It's not like particles
in the universe.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.355 align:middle line:84%
You know how the
universe is kind of big?

00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of like empty?

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
lot of space in it?

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.180 align:middle line:10%
It's not like particles
in the universe

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:17.340 align:middle line:10%
were, like, bumping into each
other, and by this great luck,

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:10%
100 trillion of them bumped
into each other just right

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.860 align:middle line:10%
to make the first cell.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:26.660 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:27.800 align:middle line:90%
Just right.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Like, they just like--

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:84%
oh, 100 trillion of them
just hit just right.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, the first cell.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it was like, oh,
a planet just ran into it.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:48.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, let's just wait
another 13 billion years.

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Never mind 100 trillion.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't add up.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.090 align:middle line:90%
Random function doesn't add up.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:02.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's gotta be
something deeper.

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The problem is when you
talk like that, then people,

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:10.380 align:middle line:84%
especially religious
beliefs, start

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.400 align:middle line:84%
to think you're talking about
god, that there's got to be

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.450 align:middle line:90%
a god organizing all this.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So there's this guy
sitting on a throne.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:25.370 align:middle line:84%
He usually as a long
white beard, you know.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And he's sitting there.

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, this guy is
able to organize all this shit,

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.540 align:middle line:84%
sitting in his
throne, hanging out.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And if he's Christian,
probably he's

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.710 align:middle line:84%
got a baseball bat,
because you're a sinner,

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.950 align:middle line:90%
and you're going to mess up.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.258 align:middle line:90%
I know you're going to mess up.

00:33:45.258 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have to whack you.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.250 align:middle line:90%
But there's another option.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.540 align:middle line:90%
There's another option.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:02.040 align:middle line:10%
And that option is that there
is information feedback,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.210 align:middle line:10%
that it's not random.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.870 align:middle line:84%
The randomness that
appears to us, random

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
is just because we don't
have a large enough sample

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:17.670 align:middle line:84%
of the information
or the structure

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:23.880 align:middle line:84%
to see the non-randomness,
although, remarkably,

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.880 align:middle line:84%
the people that think
that it's random

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.365 align:middle line:84%
are themself evidence
of the non-randomness.

00:34:31.365 --> 00:34:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.830 align:middle line:90%
So you know, that's a problem.

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.600 align:middle line:84%
That's why they don't
typically include themself

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.830 align:middle line:90%
in the equation.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.429 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's all random,
but just out there.

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I got nothing to do with it.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So then you ask, like,
well, how did we get here?

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:58.520 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it was a
mathematical fluctuation.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.915 align:middle line:84%
That's just a technical
way to say it was a fluke.

00:35:05.915 --> 00:35:08.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It was a fluke that
the 100 trillion cells

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:17.110 align:middle line:90%
got together and made us.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:10%
But the problem
with that is even

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.860 align:middle line:10%
if that was remotely
possible mathematically,

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:31.040 align:middle line:10%
it continues to be a fluke every
single billionth of a second.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Because it continues
to do the same thing.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:43.696 align:middle line:84%
It's very dedicated
random fluctuations.

00:35:43.696 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.190 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It's on a serious
random mission.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.920 align:middle line:90%


00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Because it keeps on organizing.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It keeps being negentropic,
counterentropic.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:11.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not going towards disorder.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.160 align:middle line:90%
It seems to be going towards.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:90%
How can that be?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It can only be if you
have information feedback.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:84%
That is, that the
information is going out,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and then back, and then
out, and then back.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Iterations will produce
high level of complexity,

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and high level of structure,
and high level of organization

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.740 align:middle line:90%
very, very quickly.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have equations
to describe that.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.890 align:middle line:90%
Those are fractal equations.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:56.900 align:middle line:10%
So if you have feedback,
then the information--

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:10%
then the universe clearly,
from any examination

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:08.600 align:middle line:10%
of our biological sphere of
our being on this sphere,

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:10%
of the animals on it,
clearly, that information--

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:10%
clearly, the universe, then,
must be an information network.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:19.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It must be an
information structure,

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.130 align:middle line:84%
which is transferring
information

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
across scale, because
it's organized

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.160 align:middle line:90%
along very large scales.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:84%
It needs all the components
in all of the scales

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.910 align:middle line:84%
to eventually make up a little
human being on the end that

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:90%
goes, the heck happened?

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.404 align:middle line:84%
How the heck did I get
here, sitting in the bus?

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And then the being is
thinking, oh, yeah, you know,

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.290 align:middle line:84%
well, there's the unconscious
and then there's the conscious.

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And they call the
unconscious the part

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that's running the
whole show, right?

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Like, the thing that keeps
the 100 trillion cells going,

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and that's keeping the heart
going, and the lungs going,

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.220 align:middle line:90%
We call that the unconscious.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then the part
that we call conscious

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.420 align:middle line:84%
is like the part that's,
like, utterly confused

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.710 align:middle line:90%
about the whole thing.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:10%
That part might be
the unconscious part.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:53.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Like the 0.000001 of a percent,
and then the 99.9999999%,

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.870 align:middle line:84%
the space that contains
all the information,

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
that might be the
conscious part.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Because if you had the
to-do list of that part,

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you'd be in deep
doo-doo really fast.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:24.460 align:middle line:90%
And I mean that literally.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.910 align:middle line:90%


00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Because that thing
is running the show.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And so there's two parts, right?

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:38.063 align:middle line:10%
There's the part
that's external,

00:39:38.063 --> 00:39:39.605 align:middle line:10%
and there's the part
that's internal.

00:39:39.605 --> 00:39:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I developed early on.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:84%
I was 11 years old when
I learned to meditate.

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, wait, there's
a part that's outside of me,

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.370 align:middle line:84%
and there's a part
that's inside of me.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:59.100 align:middle line:84%
There's an external world,
but there's an internal world.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.900 align:middle line:90%
And the two are valid.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
There are two
different experiences.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually, I realized,
well, maybe the world

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.400 align:middle line:90%
is like that.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So when I counted the
number of pieces of data

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.490 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of
a one proton, I

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:84%
thought, well, what about the
data that's inside the proton?

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is unusual because
when you do this kind

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:84%
of calculation-- it's called
the holographic principle--

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.300 align:middle line:84%
you're only usually supposed
to consider the surface.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.380 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, what
about the volume?

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.940 align:middle line:84%
What about what's inside, the
amount of information inside?

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.540 align:middle line:84%
So then I counted
how many were inside.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.100 align:middle line:90%
I know we're revising.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just making sure
we're all on the same page.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I counted
how many are inside.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, something
remarkable happened.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Because as you
see on this slide,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.940 align:middle line:90%
there's 10 to the 60th inside.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an energy
level of a little Planck pixel,

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:84%
so imagine a little
Planck pixel is like--

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.570 align:middle line:84%
don't think of an
oscillation as something

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:90%
that's going up and down.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That's incorrect.

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in the universe
goes up and down like that.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.280 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.050 align:middle line:90%
No such thing.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Just as much as nobody in the
universe can describe a circle.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:41.140 align:middle line:90%
That's not-- that doesn't exist.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:47.610 align:middle line:84%
It's an illusion of the sensory
system of the human being.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.420 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you start drawing
the circle, and by the time

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:55.290 align:middle line:84%
you're finished, your like,
thousands, millions of miles

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.970 align:middle line:84%
from where you
started the circle.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.966 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a circle anymore.

00:41:58.966 --> 00:41:59.840 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever think of that?

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a big problem.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:90%
So when you talk about this--

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.810 align:middle line:84%
so when I was thinking--
what was I thinking?

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of the
little oscillator

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:23.980 align:middle line:90%
as going up and down.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Because going up
and down is only

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:33.010 align:middle line:84%
true on a two-dimensional screen
of an oscilloscope, right?

00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So we all get shown
this wave thing,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:90%
which is completely artificial.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the photon,
or the electron,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.370 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're
measuring, I guarantee

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:45.110 align:middle line:90%
you, is not doing that.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It's doing this.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the Planck length
comes from the Planck energy

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.680 align:middle line:90%
or the Planck constant.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Planck constant, H-bar,
is H, the energy, over 2 pi.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.830 align:middle line:10%
That is, the energy over
a rotation, or an angular

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:08.060 align:middle line:10%
momentum.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's a little spin, right?

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So think of all
these little spins.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're all going together.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have a lot
of the little spins,

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.890 align:middle line:84%
like little vortices,
all spinning together,

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.800 align:middle line:90%
a lot of them.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So now visualize-- this is what
I call the smoothie universe.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a proton is like all
these little spins together.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You get a little ball of
spin, because they're all

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:46.930 align:middle line:84%
spinning in a coordinated
manner in that region of space,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:50.320 align:middle line:90%
like a smoothie in the morning.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Where you see all this good,
organic vegetables and fruits

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:84%
you've put in your smoothie,
you see all the bits going by,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:90%
like think of it that way.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.320 align:middle line:90%
They're all spinning together.

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And then when they spin
together like that,

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:12.340 align:middle line:84%
they create a little
coherent region in space.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And we happen to
call that a proton.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:21.850 align:middle line:84%
When I calculated the
energy or the information

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:28.120 align:middle line:84%
inside that proton, one
proton had the energy

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:34.640 align:middle line:84%
or the information of all the
other protons in the universe

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so that every bit of information
in the rest of the universe

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.315 align:middle line:90%
was present in one atom.

00:44:40.315 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:90%


00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Truly holographic.

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:90%
So now, integrate this.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Your 100 trillion cells
multiply by 100 trillion atoms.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:10%
And each of the
nuclei of these atoms,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.060 align:middle line:10%
even if they were hydrogen
and had only one proton,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:07.120 align:middle line:10%
each one would have 10 to the
60th little protons in it,

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.280 align:middle line:10%
little Plancks in
it, 10 to the 60th.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:15.655 align:middle line:84%
So you have this little
oscillator, right?

00:45:15.655 --> 00:45:17.440 align:middle line:90%
E equals mc squared.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So when an oscillator
is oscillating,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
you can calculate
its energy, its mass.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.180 align:middle line:84%
The mass of a little Planck
has 10 to the 5 grams.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot because the thing--
the little thing is, like,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.417 align:middle line:90%
turning really, really fast.

00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:35.217 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:35.217 --> 00:45:37.890 align:middle line:84%
It's turning at the speed of
light, so it's a lot of energy.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.190 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Then you calculate 10 to
the 60th multiplied by 10

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to the minus 5 grams to get
the mass or the energy of all

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.130 align:middle line:90%
the Plancks inside one proton.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.550 align:middle line:84%
You get 10 to the 55, which
is the mass of the universe.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So you get the mass of the
universe inside a proton.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.340 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.810 align:middle line:84%
So that pretty well makes
a proton a black hole.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:08.580 align:middle line:90%
Just saying.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.860 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that you're made
out of little black holes?

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.170 align:middle line:90%


00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:10%
That kind of like got
past the mainstream.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:21.850 align:middle line:90%
They missed that one.

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:23.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
measured a proton,

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.560 align:middle line:84%
they don't measure
the mass of a black--

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:84%
they don't measure the
mass of the universe.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.944 align:middle line:90%
Are do they?

00:46:34.944 --> 00:46:37.836 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:37.836 --> 00:46:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, they kind of do, but
they don't know they are.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.320 align:middle line:90%


00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when they measure
the mass of the proton,

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.330 align:middle line:84%
they can only measure
the energy that's

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.870 align:middle line:84%
able to come out of
that little black hole.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's divided by the
surface of the little Planck.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:84%
So I gotta divide the surface
by the volume, meaning,

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:84%
imagine the
boundaries restricting

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.630 align:middle line:84%
how much the universe
is able to talk to you.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You're on the outside,
looking at the surface.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, oh,
it's not very energetic.

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.120 align:middle line:10%
And meanwhile, the
universe is inside there.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.370 align:middle line:10%
It reminds me a
little bit of what

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:40.530 align:middle line:10%
I was talking to the
Spanish community

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.830 align:middle line:10%
this afternoon, when I did my
talk to the Spanish community.

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:10%


00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.210 align:middle line:10%
I was telling them
that the human--

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.900 align:middle line:10%
the universe is singing.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:55.900 align:middle line:10%
It's singing in all these
amazing harmonic relationships

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.920 align:middle line:10%
at all the scales?

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.070 align:middle line:10%
But we don't hear it.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:06.840 align:middle line:10%
Some people at Conscious
Life Expo hear it.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.600 align:middle line:84%
They call it the little voice,
the little intuition, the gut

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.470 align:middle line:84%
feeling, right, that thing
that you're all following?

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.860 align:middle line:84%
That's how you ended up at
Conscious Life Expo, going,

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe they can tell me how
the hell I got down here.

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:26.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.000 align:middle line:90%


00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.440 align:middle line:84%
This little voice,
I was telling them,

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:84%
that little voice
is not so little.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:84%
On the other side of the
veils of your consciousness,

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.040 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
wall, that little voice

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.810 align:middle line:90%
is screaming, like, dude!

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Hello over there!

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You are part of a universe!

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.524 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:00.524 --> 00:49:03.260 align:middle line:90%


00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I know you're in your
bus going to work.

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:14.660 align:middle line:84%
But maybe you should consider
the rest of the universe.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:15.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:90%
That little voice is screaming.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And you, on the other side
of the wall, is going, huh,

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm hearing something.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.640 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.820 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, just like that, the vacuum
structure inside the proton

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.540 align:middle line:84%
contains all the
information in the universe,

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:46.160 align:middle line:84%
but only a little bit
is able to emerge,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:50.900 align:middle line:84%
a little teeny voice of the
whole singing of the universe

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.030 align:middle line:84%
is able to emerge
over the surface.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.730 align:middle line:90%


00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.270 align:middle line:10%
And when I calculated that way--

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:03.860 align:middle line:10%
it took me 30 years
to figure it out.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.900 align:middle line:10%
I mean, seriously, 30
bloody years, right?

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:12.740 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we're talking
like complex equations,

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.580 align:middle line:10%
you know, relativistic
equations, like Einstein field

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.430 align:middle line:10%
equation, tensors equations.

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:26.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're like, algebra up
the yin-yang, like, oh, my god.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.262 align:middle line:84%
And then I come down to, like,
a volume over the surface ratio?

00:50:31.262 --> 00:50:33.617 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:33.617 --> 00:50:35.980 align:middle line:90%


00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.105 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:50:37.105 --> 00:50:39.435 align:middle line:90%


00:50:39.435 --> 00:50:40.235 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:50:40.235 --> 00:50:44.040 align:middle line:90%


00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:50.400 align:middle line:84%
At the time I figured this
out, my kid was five or six.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.730 align:middle line:90%
And I explained it to him.

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:54.780 align:middle line:90%
And he looked at me.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.660 align:middle line:90%
He goes, really, Papa?

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.860 align:middle line:90%
That's all?

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.790 align:middle line:90%
He goes, oh, my god.

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Why did it take you so long?

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, dude.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.430 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Then the other guy
goes, are you sure

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.540 align:middle line:84%
the other guys don't
think this the same?

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, no, o, I
really checked it out.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They really didn't
figure that all out yet.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So when I solved this,
it came out just right.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.580 align:middle line:84%
It came out just right for
the mass of the proton,

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.610 align:middle line:84%
the mass of the proton, and
then, eventually, the electron,

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:42.665 align:middle line:84%
which I wrote with Dr.
Val Baker and Olivier.

00:51:42.665 --> 00:51:46.930 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.420 align:middle line:84%
We came out with all
the table of elements.

00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.370 align:middle line:90%
It all comes out.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's really precise.

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.730 align:middle line:84%
Because then I could output
the radius of the proton.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:52:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And oh, my god, the radius
of the proton, the equation

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:04.490 align:middle line:84%
outputted was 4% smaller than
the standard model radius.

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:08.740 align:middle line:84%
It was 4% smaller than
what they were measuring.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.170 align:middle line:10%
And I was like--

00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:15.610 align:middle line:10%
you know, 4% in quantum theory
is like another universe.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:19.820 align:middle line:10%
So 4% wrong is really bad.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So I had the choice in the
paper to say it's 4% wrong,

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:26.866 align:middle line:84%
or it's 4% right and
you guys are wrong.

00:52:26.866 --> 00:52:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I went for
the second option.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.135 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:31.135 --> 00:52:32.560 align:middle line:90%


00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it was right for
all the rest of the stuff

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I was calculating, so I
figure it's got to be right.

00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And you know,
unknowingly to me--

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
they were trying

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to measure the radius of
the proton more precisely.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And within months
of me publishing,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.032 align:middle line:84%
they published papers
with the new value

00:52:54.032 --> 00:52:55.240 align:middle line:90%
for the radius of the proton.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.080 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.460 align:middle line:90%
It was 4% smaller.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And my equation, to this
day, is the most precise

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.465 align:middle line:84%
theoretical prediction of
the radius of the proton.

00:53:04.465 --> 00:53:07.780 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.945 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, baby.

00:53:08.945 --> 00:53:11.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.230 align:middle line:90%


00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:20.180 align:middle line:90%
And so I was excited.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we got the electron,
and then that came out.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we realized, well,
OK, what about the universe?

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.270 align:middle line:90%
The mass of the universe?

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is the paper
we just finished.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So we started it shortly after
the prediction for the radius

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.760 align:middle line:90%
of the proton in 2013.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And we were excited to see
that actually, Einstein

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.786 align:middle line:90%
published just after me.

00:53:53.786 --> 00:53:54.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:56.670 align:middle line:90%


00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It's remarkable that
Einstein can publish

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.850 align:middle line:90%
across the veil of the grave.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:03.705 align:middle line:90%
But he's that kind of guy.

00:54:03.705 --> 00:54:06.430 align:middle line:90%


00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:11.740 align:middle line:84%
In 2013, they found a paper that
had been lost from Einstein.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:10%
And that paper talked
about an alternative

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:20.780 align:middle line:10%
to the Big Bang Theory
in which Einstein

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:25.400 align:middle line:10%
solved for the universe
having a vacuum,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:30.760 align:middle line:10%
energized vacuum energy
that was producing protons

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:36.650 align:middle line:10%
and expelling protons from our
universe at a constant rate

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:39.950 align:middle line:10%
so that it was a
steady state universe.

00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:44.674 align:middle line:84%
And that's how matter
production was occurring.

00:54:44.674 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry?

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So Einstein, in 2013,
published a paper

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that described the
universe as a steady state

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:07.390 align:middle line:84%
universe in which the vacuum
fluctuation, this energy

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:12.940 align:middle line:84%
in the vacuum, was
creating protons,

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and protons were escaping
our universe at the same rate

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:20.350 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a steady
state creation universe, where

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:24.420 align:middle line:84%
continuous creation
is occurring.

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And he probably
didn't publish it

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:32.580 align:middle line:10%
because he knew he was going
to get tomatoes thrown at him.

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:37.410 align:middle line:90%
So it took until 2013, you know.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was great,
because then, it

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.910 align:middle line:84%
was supporting exactly where
Dr. Val Baker and I were going.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.360 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:49.790 align:middle line:90%


00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:54.714 align:middle line:90%
So it occurred to me that--

00:55:54.714 --> 00:55:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I think we cited it too.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:55:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Did we cite it?

00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.320 align:middle line:90%
We cited it.

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.836 align:middle line:90%
We're citing Einstein 2013.

00:56:01.836 --> 00:56:04.172 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:04.172 --> 00:56:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.350 align:middle line:90%
So nice.

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:12.792 align:middle line:84%
So nice of him to
give me that support.

00:56:12.792 --> 00:56:15.640 align:middle line:84%
A little thumbs
up from Einstein.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.370 align:middle line:90%


00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:25.690 align:middle line:10%
And so we considered
what happens if we

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:27.730 align:middle line:10%
were to take this solution.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:35.620 align:middle line:10%
So the solution,
again, is applicable to

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.000 align:middle line:10%
not only to the proton
or the electron,

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:52.330 align:middle line:10%
but to all black holes, so
that it became clear to me--

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:57.010 align:middle line:10%
so I can now put the mass of any
black hole using this equation,

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:02.050 align:middle line:10%
just talking about
the information that's

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:04.330 align:middle line:10%
contained in it and
the information that's

00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:05.920 align:middle line:10%
on the surface.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.830 align:middle line:90%
So let me make this clear.

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:13.300 align:middle line:10%
That means that
mass, gravity, is

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.770 align:middle line:10%
a function of information
transfer across the event

00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:22.120 align:middle line:10%
horizon of a black hole,
whether at the atomic level

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.010 align:middle line:10%
or at the cosmological level.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:30.220 align:middle line:10%
Whatever we call mass,
which is completely

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:33.160 align:middle line:10%
undefined in physics--

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.880 align:middle line:10%
You know, we have this
wonderful equation from Einstein

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:42.340 align:middle line:10%
that E equals mc squared--
we all know that one, right?

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's beautiful.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's absolutely,
completely useless

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:51.790 align:middle line:84%
to tell us anything
fundamental about all

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:56.190 align:middle line:84%
the variables in the
equation, meaning

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:58.650 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what m is.

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So-- and we certainly don't
know why c going at c.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:05.880 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So that means on the
other side of the equal,

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:10.770 align:middle line:90%
we don't know what E is.

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:16.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have a nice equivalence
between three unknowns.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:22.581 align:middle line:84%
It's all equal to each other,
but we have no clue what it is.

00:58:22.581 --> 00:58:25.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So now, from this
equation, we're

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:33.950 align:middle line:84%
starting to realize,
oh, it's information.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:39.530 align:middle line:84%
It's information moving
through the field.

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:44.760 align:middle line:90%
And so that is mass.

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.740 align:middle line:10%
Gravity is most likely the
movement of information

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:49.730 align:middle line:10%
through the field.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I am using
"most likely" loosely,

00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:56.810 align:middle line:84%
because we clearly see
that in this equation.

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:00.065 align:middle line:84%
It is the result of
information moving.

00:59:00.065 --> 00:59:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And charge and
electromagnetism and so on.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So now, we start
to see, it's just

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.510 align:middle line:90%
the universe's juice flowing.

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I told you it was
going to get juicy.

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:16.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It's just the universe's
juice flowing.

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.030 align:middle line:90%
And when it flows, life emerges.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.014 align:middle line:90%
[CLICKS TONGUE]

00:59:28.014 --> 00:59:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:35.600 align:middle line:84%
I could take some
very large left turns

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:43.970 align:middle line:84%
into a whole bunch of
very eccentric ideas,

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.367 align:middle line:84%
talking about juices
flowing, producing life.

00:59:48.367 --> 00:59:49.700 align:middle line:90%
But we're not going to go there.

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:52.620 --> 01:00:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, this dynamic
of space, you can imagine,

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:09.470 align:middle line:84%
has a certain
amount of pressure,

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:13.100 align:middle line:84%
meaning if the juices
that are flowing

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.230 align:middle line:84%
are restricted in some
way, pressure builds.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.640 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:24.750 align:middle line:10%
And when it builds,
it's not so good.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.340 align:middle line:10%
It starts pushing on things.

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Things expand.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:34.600 align:middle line:90%
Let's just put it that way.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And when they expand,
we can calculate

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
what the density change
happen as they do, right?

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
As a body changes size,
as the volume expands,

01:00:50.290 --> 01:00:51.715 align:middle line:90%
the density drops.

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.320 align:middle line:90%


01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
So we took the
proton, and we said,

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's grow a proton to
the size of the universe.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.590 align:middle line:90%


01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And when we did,
remarkable solution

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of the expansion of the proton,
we calculated the density.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we got was the correct
density for our universe.

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:27.478 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we published.

01:01:27.478 --> 01:01:30.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
But we didn't just get the
correct density approximately.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:47.230 align:middle line:84%
We didn't just get somewhat
of the correct mass

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.500 align:middle line:90%
for the universe.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:55.930 align:middle line:84%
We got exactly the critical
mass of the universe.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
This is how it's called, the
critical mass for the universe,

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
not just the baryonic
mass, the critical mass.

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:09.560 align:middle line:90%
What is the critical mass?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is the problem
of the vacuum catastrophe.

01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
the universal density

01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and the vacuum density
at the quantum level

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
is 122 orders of magnitude.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's this fight
between the astrophysicists

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:33.040 align:middle line:90%
and the quantum physicists.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
One says, oh, it's 10 the 93
grams per centimeter cubed.

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The other one's
saying, oh, no, it's

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
10 to the minus 30 grams
per centimeter cubed.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's completely
a big problem in physics.

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can show it's just
because the density changed

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
between a proton
and the universe.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
When a proton expands to
the sides of the universe,

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%
the density drops.

01:02:58.850 --> 01:02:59.975 align:middle line:90%
So the two are correct.

01:02:59.975 --> 01:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They're just at
different scales.

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:04.490 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:09.460 align:middle line:84%
But when we did that, something
more remarkable happened.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what Amira
was alluding to.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Like, we didn't
publish right away.

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.180 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't happening.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Amira couldn't tie me down to a
chair long enough in four years

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.270 align:middle line:90%
to finish a paper.

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:26.815 align:middle line:90%
I felt like it was unfinished.

01:03:26.815 --> 01:03:31.950 align:middle line:84%
I had the little
voice screaming.

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.490 align:middle line:90%
You missed it!

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:34.750 align:middle line:90%
You missed it!

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.600 align:middle line:90%


01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.770 align:middle line:84%
What happened is that
when we solved it,

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
we found the critical mass
of the universe-- that

01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:48.680 align:middle line:84%
is, the baryonic mass,
that is, all the particles

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:54.950 align:middle line:84%
in the universe plus dark
matter and dark energy.

01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:59.240 align:middle line:84%
It gave the exact
mass of the universe,

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
unlike the standard model
of the universe that we're

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.220 align:middle line:84%
using right now that
ends up giving only 4%

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:13.265 align:middle line:84%
of the mass of the universe,
missing 96% of the mass.

01:04:13.265 --> 01:04:16.410 align:middle line:90%


01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So you have an equation that's
wrong by 96% on the mass,

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.760 align:middle line:90%
the size of the universe.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It's somewhat significant.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:31.520 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Like at school, when you do
exams, if you're wrong by 96%,

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.340 align:middle line:90%
usually you don't pass.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.500 align:middle line:90%
You're, like, shit out of luck.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.990 align:middle line:84%
You got to do the
course again, right?

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:49.852 align:middle line:90%
Try again.

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:53.640 align:middle line:10%
You do that too many times,
usually, they tell you,

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.930 align:middle line:10%
you know, maybe you should try,
like, bowling or you know--

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:04.300 align:middle line:10%


01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.150 align:middle line:10%
But somehow, the
standard model has

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:13.360 align:middle line:10%
been accepted, that,
oh, well, we're just

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:19.210 align:middle line:10%
going to fill in the 96%
with shit we can't see

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.130 align:middle line:10%
and we can't measure.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So like that, we're
good, you know.

01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:23.550 align:middle line:90%
You can't measure.

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:25.170 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
Very useful, right?

01:05:27.810 --> 01:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Just throw that in,
and you're good, right?

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.670 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look!

01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:35.025 align:middle line:90%
Now the equation is so accurate.

01:05:35.025 --> 01:05:37.436 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:37.436 --> 01:05:40.400 align:middle line:90%


01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:46.400 align:middle line:10%
And so this idea of dark
matter, and dark energy--

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.850 align:middle line:10%
and then lately,
there's been even more.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically, when you have
a problem in physics,

01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
you just put "dark" in front
of the name, and you're good.

01:05:58.310 --> 01:06:05.510 align:middle line:10%
So lately, dark photons has
appeared in the literature.

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:11.290 align:middle line:10%
I mean, photons are
particles of light.

01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:13.270 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is a dark photon?

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:15.935 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:15.935 --> 01:06:20.150 align:middle line:90%


01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Just reading the title,
I was having convulsions.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:28.010 align:middle line:90%


01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is really good that
when we render our equation, all

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.990 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, we get the
correct mass of the universe

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to put
any dark numbers in front

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.770 align:middle line:90%
of our equation.

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:51.600 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.490 align:middle line:90%
We get rid of the dark shit.

01:06:53.490 --> 01:06:57.790 align:middle line:90%


01:06:57.790 --> 01:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And basically, we can describe
that the universe basic--

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.120 align:middle line:90%
So imagine this.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.420 align:middle line:90%
You have a little proton.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And it expands to the
size of the universe.

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And inside is all these
fluids, the juices, right?

01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
The information
juice is in there.

01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, as it expands, the
turbulence that's generated,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
the vortices that are
generated in the super fluid

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:27.160 align:middle line:90%
structure of spacetime.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:32.665 align:middle line:84%
And all these vortices
produce what we call mass.

01:07:32.665 --> 01:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%


01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Starts to make sense?

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we calculate it
like that, it adds up.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:43.720 align:middle line:90%
You get the right mass.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.230 align:middle line:90%


01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that remarkable?

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.850 align:middle line:90%
I am really happy with it.

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.280 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.170 align:middle line:90%


01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:03.420 align:middle line:84%
So we got the critical
mass, which is 9.24 10

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.640 align:middle line:90%
to the 55 grams.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is the vacuum
density for the ones

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that I am sure many of you
are interested in calculating.

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:14.870 align:middle line:90%


01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:21.720 align:middle line:10%
And so this is the
density of the structure.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's remarkable as well is
that, when you're done, you go,

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.310 align:middle line:90%
oh, wow, check this out.

01:08:29.310 --> 01:08:33.359 align:middle line:84%
If you rearrange the
equation we wrote,

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:39.890 align:middle line:84%
it turns out that it
describe exactly the radius

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:40.790 align:middle line:90%
of a black hole.

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.689 align:middle line:90%


01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So not only you're made
out of little black holes,

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:49.680 align:middle line:90%
but you live in one.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:52.580 align:middle line:90%


01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's been
said before to physicists--

01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.600 align:middle line:90%


01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.606 align:middle line:84%
am I supposed to
understand all this sign

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:04.689 align:middle line:90%
language you're giving me?

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:08.090 align:middle line:90%


01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:09.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:10.890 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.090 align:middle line:90%
That's it?

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Holy schmoly, how
did that happen?

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:18.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'm going to
talk really fast.

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.910 align:middle line:90%


01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So this structure, this equation
tells us that actually--

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, because when
you talk to physicists--

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's been said
to physicists,

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
it's been pointed out to
physicists before that,

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:40.859 align:middle line:84%
like, the universe
seemed to obey

01:09:40.859 --> 01:09:45.149 align:middle line:90%
the solution for a black hole.

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:50.189 align:middle line:84%
That is, the mass relative
to the surface, to the size,

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:51.510 align:middle line:90%
is dense enough.

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Although the
universe is not very

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.490 align:middle line:84%
dense from our perspective,
it's dense enough

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.750 align:middle line:90%
to be a black hole.

01:09:57.750 --> 01:10:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And the physicists'
answer usually

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.650 align:middle line:84%
is, well, it's kind of good,
but it's not quite that.

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:08.070 align:middle line:90%
It's off by about a factor of 2.

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.800 align:middle line:90%
So we can discard it.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.890 align:middle line:90%
It's a coincidence.

01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of close.

01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
But it's not close enough.

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm showing here
is that, well, that's

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
true, because they
never included

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the 96% dark matter and dark
energy in the equations.

01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:28.142 align:middle line:84%
So they only took
the matter part

01:10:28.142 --> 01:10:30.225 align:middle line:84%
and then plugged it into
the black hole equations,

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.280 align:middle line:90%
and said, ah, you see?

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.120 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't add up.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But then on the other
equation over there,

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:37.820 align:middle line:84%
they have to add dark
matter and dark energy

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
to make the universe
the way it does.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So you can't do it there
and not do it over here.

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a perfect black
hole, perfect, exact.

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, not approximately,
but exact.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%
And so that matches the proton.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
That matches the
nuclei of atoms.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Atoms and universes are the
same thing at different scales.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you might have a hard
time visualizing the black hole

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
universe because when you've
been taught about black holes,

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.760 align:middle line:84%
you've been taught that
black holes are this really

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:26.300 align:middle line:84%
dense thing that
sucks up everything.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, like Olivier
and I were looking for one

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.360 align:middle line:84%
when we were trying to clean
up the car the other day

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
because our vacuum didn't work.

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, black holes don't have
that crazy density idea.

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:43.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to be.

01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So this is a simple
equation showing you,

01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.040 align:middle line:84%
using the holographic
math solution,

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.670 align:middle line:90%
showing you that if we--

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:54.530 align:middle line:84%
or using the standard
equation, if you wanted to--

01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
showing you that
if we actually put

01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere of the air of
our planet in our solar system

01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:06.800 align:middle line:84%
so that our solar
system had the density

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of the atmosphere of our planet,
it would be a black hole.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.410 align:middle line:90%


01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:13.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Because if the black--

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
if the structure is large
enough, the density can be low.

01:12:18.970 --> 01:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
It still has the mass
necessary to be a black hole.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.160 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%


01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's remarkable.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.850 align:middle line:90%
We live in scalar black holes.

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:38.256 align:middle line:84%
We live in singularities
at every point in space.

01:12:38.256 --> 01:12:42.740 align:middle line:90%


01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And these equations tells
us something even much more

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:57.770 align:middle line:84%
fundamental about creation,
about the dynamics

01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:06.800 align:middle line:84%
of a universe production and
the genesis of universes.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.470 align:middle line:90%
So why did the proton expand?

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
All the protons don't expand
to the size of the universe.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
If you had a proton
inside of you

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that expanded to the size
of the universe right now,

01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:24.950 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't be good.

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:27.530 align:middle line:10%
It just wouldn't be good, right?

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:34.100 align:middle line:10%
So protons in fact, are the most
stable particles we know of.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:37.670 align:middle line:10%
We've never seen a
proton decay whatsoever.

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.400 align:middle line:10%
We see orbitals
of protons decay,

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.610 align:middle line:10%
but we don't see proton decay.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
They don't-- they
just keep on ticking,

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:50.270 align:middle line:84%
like way better than
the Energizer bunny.

01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:52.580 align:middle line:90%
They just go, right?

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:55.280 align:middle line:84%
For billions of years,
they don't slow down.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.540 align:middle line:90%
They don't decay.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
So why would a proton
all of a sudden decay

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:03.626 align:middle line:90%
to the size of the universe?

01:14:03.626 --> 01:14:06.620 align:middle line:90%


01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to us
that the protons that

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:19.760 align:middle line:90%
would escape a universe--

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
think of Einstein, 2013,
publishing from the other side.

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:30.320 align:middle line:90%


01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
A proton that
escapes our universe

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
would enter a larger universe
with a much lower pressure,

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
with a much lower density.

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So that proton would
be out of equilibrium.

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the proton
inside our universe

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:50.540 align:middle line:84%
has the same amount of
information inside as all

01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:52.790 align:middle line:90%
the stuff outside of itself.

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:57.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's absolutely stable.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But a proton that escapes
our universe all of a sudden

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.550 align:middle line:84%
would arrive in the universe
with much lower density,

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
it would just expand super fast,
really, really, really fast,

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and create a
universe of its own.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So you could imagine the
surface of universal black hole.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.830 align:middle line:84%
If you were a giant,
bigger than the universe,

01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:26.290 align:middle line:84%
looking at that
universe, you would

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:30.550 align:middle line:84%
see forming particles
coming off it,

01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
expanding into new universes in
a continuous matter creation,

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:42.030 align:middle line:84%
in a continuous
universal creation

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:45.280 align:middle line:90%
right in front of your eyes.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.750 align:middle line:10%
And that was to answer George
Noory's question at the panel

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:51.040 align:middle line:10%
today.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:55.330 align:middle line:10%
There is no beginning,
and then there is no end.

01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It is a continuum of creation.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And that takes a
while to integrate.

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
It takes a while to
integrate no beginning.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Our mind always wants
to start somewhere.

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:20.560 align:middle line:10%
But that's a concept of
man, not of universe, right?

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It's this continuous
juices flowing.

01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:27.910 align:middle line:90%


01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And so this is not
such a crazy idea.

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
I know I have kind of an
eccentric approach to physics.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And you know, there is a lot
of really good physicists

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:43.810 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:44.750 align:middle line:90%
And I make fun.

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's an amazing
thing that we can even

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
consider these ideas,
folks, and that we

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:55.380 align:middle line:84%
can hear on the little
Earth, on the little--

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
solve this equation
and understand

01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%
what the universe is doing.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable, right?

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:03.800 align:middle line:90%
So I make fun.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.980 align:middle line:84%
But this is Susskind,
probably one

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:09.890 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest theoretical
physicists as well,

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
with Wilczek, right there
with Wilczek and others,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.360 align:middle line:90%
talking about this possibility.

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.170 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.630 align:middle line:84%
- What we may be able to do
is to look into the past,

01:17:21.630 --> 01:17:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and by looking into
the past discover

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.090 align:middle line:84%
that our universe was born from
one of these bubble nucleation.

01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:32.450 align:middle line:84%
This is possible, that we will
be able to look into the past

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
and see the event which
gave rise to our universe

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.880 align:middle line:84%
being a nucleation from
another point in the landscape.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.740 align:middle line:90%
That is possible.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:43.620 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So he's talking about these
bubble universes that could be

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
emerging from other universes,
this fractal creation

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of universes that could be
occurring in our universe.

01:17:56.170 --> 01:18:02.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely different
picture than the Big Bang.

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
The idea that
everything happened

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:09.580 align:middle line:84%
from the point of nothing
to boom, all of a sudden,

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.950 align:middle line:84%
all the particles
in the universe, all

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the time and space in
one big fart is unlikely.

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:22.380 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
- It's a variation of Genesis.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
- I'm sorry?

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a variation of
the Book of Genesis.

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a variation of the
Book of Genesis, very good.

01:18:31.090 --> 01:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
You find this
bubble universe idea

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:38.680 align:middle line:84%
in many ancient texts, this
continuous creation concept.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%


01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.720 align:middle line:10%
The Big Bang violates
most laws of physics,

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.690 align:middle line:10%
including conservation
law, relativity, you

01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:58.260 align:middle line:10%
know, big problems with
the Big Bang, including,

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.610 align:middle line:10%
I don't see how it relates so
well to the Book of Genesis.

01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the Book of Genesis
talks about a universe being

01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:09.465 align:middle line:90%
creating very rapidly.

01:19:09.465 --> 01:19:12.930 align:middle line:90%


01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the value of the
Big Bang and the value

01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of a proton expanding
from another universe

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:28.620 align:middle line:84%
would be very much similar,
in your observation-- where's

01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.160 align:middle line:90%
the person that's talking?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Would be very much
the same observation

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.210 align:middle line:90%
from our point of view, right?

01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:38.670 align:middle line:90%
But there would be one variable.

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And in one case, you have linear
time with a start and an end.

01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
In the other case, you
have eternal creation.

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And the Bible is pretty
clear on the eternal thing

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.010 align:middle line:10%
that keeps on going.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:54.810 align:middle line:10%
Right?

01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:57.720 align:middle line:10%
They call it god.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So I wouldn't go with
eternal model more than the--

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:05.790 align:middle line:10%
if I was trying
to match to the--

01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:10.330 align:middle line:10%
I just want to finish, and
then we'll take questions.

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:17.940 align:middle line:10%
So here, such a universe
that would emerge from ours

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:19.080 align:middle line:10%
would be entangled.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:21.620 align:middle line:90%


01:20:21.620 --> 01:20:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Susskind and others are coming
to this conclusion as well.

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:27.770 align:middle line:84%
All the protons,
all the particles

01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:33.470 align:middle line:84%
are entangled through little
wormholes in Planck's field.

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:40.790 align:middle line:84%
This fluid, this super fluid
produces little vortices,

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
strings that connects
all the pieces.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And so when a piece of that one
universe that's entangled with

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.480 align:middle line:84%
all of the other pieces in
that universe comes out--

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.900 align:middle line:84%
because remember,
it's all one thing--

01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.260 align:middle line:84%
when it comes out,
it's still entangled.

01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So it just entangled
two universes.

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the part
of the particles

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that come out of
that new universe

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:12.680 align:middle line:84%
entangle with new
universes, and nah and nah.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:13.520 align:middle line:90%
And then guess what?

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
Particles are falling
into other universes

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and entangled in
them even stronger.

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:25.400 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing becomes
this incredible network

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:32.930 align:middle line:84%
of informational, universal,
bubbled, fractal expansion

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
of creation that you have access
to every one of your protons.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.630 align:middle line:90%


01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you
call your subconscious.

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:55.110 align:middle line:90%


01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And just a little bit
of the information

01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:06.270 align:middle line:84%
that goes across the boundary
is what you call your conscious,

01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:11.255 align:middle line:84%
the little bit that
goes, how did I get here?

01:22:11.255 --> 01:22:12.055 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:22:12.055 --> 01:22:17.330 align:middle line:90%


01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So then when you
become aware of this,

01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:27.015 align:middle line:84%
you realize, wow, we're
all connected, for real.

01:22:27.015 --> 01:22:29.810 align:middle line:90%


01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And every node in the network
is observing the universe

01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:36.770 align:middle line:90%
from its own perspective.

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Everybody sees this mic
from its own perspective.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Everybody sees everything
from its own perspective

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
because we're in different
coordinates in spacetime.

01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
So although we're
all connected, we

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.380 align:middle line:90%
don't all see the same thing.

01:22:53.380 --> 01:22:54.260 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
You see this side of the mic.

01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:58.880 align:middle line:10%
I see this side of the mic.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.050 align:middle line:84%
If I have a wheel spinning
between you and I,

01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:04.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll say it's going
clockwise, and you'll say,

01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:07.540 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's going counterclockwise.

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Who's right?

01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it going at all?

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if I had those vectors,
they cancel out, folks.

01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:17.592 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%


01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:29.190 align:middle line:10%
So all perspectives produce
specific sets of information

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:31.980 align:middle line:10%
in specific coordinates
in spacetime

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.610 align:middle line:10%
which have specific interaction
with the universe, that

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:41.340 align:middle line:10%
is, specifically feeding
information to the universe

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.660 align:middle line:10%
from their perspective.

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And it is all of the
perspectives together

01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:50.015 align:middle line:10%
that produces the reality
that we experience.

01:23:50.015 --> 01:23:50.815 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:23:50.815 --> 01:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%


01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:57.950 align:middle line:90%
So no isolation is possible.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So any law of physics that
starts within an isolated

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.150 align:middle line:90%
system, you can scrap.

01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:07.950 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:24:07.950 --> 01:24:11.630 align:middle line:90%


01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:16.790 align:middle line:90%
So that we are all connected.

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And now-- but then
you say, well,

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
can I write physics on
everything being connected?

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
That means anything I
measure or calculate,

01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.810 align:middle line:84%
I've got to consider
everything else.

01:24:26.810 --> 01:24:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes, you can.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.440 align:middle line:90%
I just showed it to you.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
It gives the correct answer.

01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:34.280 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it's in
bits of information

01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:38.915 align:middle line:90%
localized in a region of space.

01:24:38.915 --> 01:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%


01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Each bit--

01:24:42.730 --> 01:24:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can say, I have
a frame of reference.

01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I have a frame of reference.

01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I have a frame of reference.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.420 align:middle line:84%
I have a frame of reference,
all these frame of references.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
But then you can say,
hey, I'm not just one.

01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:57.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm 100 trillion cells.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm 100 trillion
frame of references.

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:06.830 align:middle line:10%
And experience
those frames, right?

01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm connected to them,
obviously, since it makes me.

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I can say, wait,
I'm 100 trillion multiplied

01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:21.940 align:middle line:84%
by 100 trillion frame of
reference at the atomic level,

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:24.030 align:middle line:84%
each one experiencing
the universe

01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:26.730 align:middle line:90%
from its own perspective.

01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's the correlation of
all these frames together--

01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:32.520 align:middle line:90%
we see the fractal thing--

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.900 align:middle line:84%
that makes me, all
the frames, just

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:39.947 align:middle line:84%
like it's the correlation
of all the frames

01:25:39.947 --> 01:25:41.530 align:middle line:84%
of all the things
in the universe that

01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:43.840 align:middle line:90%
makes the universe.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.070 align:middle line:90%
Just the same.

01:25:45.070 --> 01:25:48.050 align:middle line:84%
You can do that same
thing at all scales.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And so you are tapping into
this field of information.

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You are feeding it.

01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
You are feeding it
your perspective.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And your perspective matters.

01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:03.500 align:middle line:90%
And I mean that literally.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:09.090 align:middle line:90%


01:26:09.090 --> 01:26:14.355 align:middle line:84%
It is feeding energy,
information to the field.

01:26:14.355 --> 01:26:17.320 align:middle line:90%


01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And so consciousness-- and
that will be the subject

01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:24.940 align:middle line:90%
of my talk on Monday.

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness-- and
we'll experiment

01:26:27.850 --> 01:26:35.580 align:middle line:84%
with that because I built
little cool technology to mess

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:40.410 align:middle line:84%
with the information transfer
in the juice field of creation.

01:26:40.410 --> 01:26:44.890 align:middle line:90%


01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a
flow of information

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:55.590 align:middle line:84%
through the bio-oscillating
structure of your being.

01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:59.520 align:middle line:84%
All of the cells, all of
the atoms, all of the cells,

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and all of the organization, all
of the biorhythms of your body,

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.210 align:middle line:84%
like the heart beating,
the lungs expanding,

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:14.490 align:middle line:84%
the spinal cord fluid going up
and down, expanding your skull,

01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:19.470 align:middle line:90%
all this is creating you.

01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:26.850 align:middle line:10%
And that biofield, that
oscillating, bio-crystal

01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:33.600 align:middle line:10%
structure that you are, you can
tune to different frequencies

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.360 align:middle line:10%
and get different
sets of information

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:43.820 align:middle line:10%
like you can tune a radio
station to Radio Moscow

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.690 align:middle line:10%
or to George Noory.

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:50.750 align:middle line:90%


01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And so what that means is that
you have an infinite potential

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.180 align:middle line:84%
of influencing the universe,
and the universe has

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:10.130 align:middle line:84%
an infinite potential
on influencing you.

01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Do not forget that second
part of the equation.

01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:17.750 align:middle line:10%
OK?

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot of
people here going around,

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
like, you're creating
your reality.

01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:27.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's half the equation.

01:28:27.930 --> 01:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
The other half is that
reality is creating you.

01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:36.070 align:middle line:90%
So it's a feedback.

01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:38.500 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
can just draw whatever

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
you want in there,
and then it comes back

01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:43.340 align:middle line:90%
exactly the way you want it.

01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.740 align:middle line:84%
If it was that, it
would be really easy.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You would solve that really
quick, get everything you want.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd be
bored for eternity.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.200 align:middle line:90%
It'd be like, what do I do now?

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I got everything I want.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm shit out of luck.

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I can't learn anything.

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm shit-- right?

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you feed the
information to the field,

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:11.540 align:middle line:84%
then it's modified by the rest
of the things that are feeding

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:12.800 align:middle line:90%
information in the field.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes
back to you, modified

01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:17.700 align:middle line:90%
by the rest of the universe.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:20.630 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it so
that you have to adjust.

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you feed
back your experience,

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and then you adjust, and you
feed back, and you adjust.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the system is
self-driven, self-organizing,

01:29:31.190 --> 01:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
fractal complexity
going to infinity.

01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:38.550 align:middle line:90%


01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:29:40.610 --> 01:29:41.770 align:middle line:90%
That's exciting, right?

01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:44.734 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:29:44.734 --> 01:29:54.840 align:middle line:90%


01:29:54.840 --> 01:30:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So humanity is
awakening to this truth.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:04.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's awakening not just as
philosophy, it's awakening--

01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you just saw some of the
most revered scientists

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:13.720 align:middle line:84%
on the planet arriving
to these conclusions.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
You are children of
the ether, right?

01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And they're excellent thinkers.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.440 align:middle line:84%
They're excellent
physicists, brilliant people

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
that can lead humanity
to a whole new level.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.940 align:middle line:90%
We're getting there.

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Like, we are getting there.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
coming here for 14 years,

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and you're like,
dude, are we evolving,

01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or are we just like spinning
our wheels over here?

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.490 align:middle line:84%
We're just, like, the
same group of weirdos.

01:30:56.490 --> 01:30:58.882 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:58.882 --> 01:31:01.272 align:middle line:90%


01:31:01.272 --> 01:31:05.750 align:middle line:84%
If this dude at this booth tries
to sell me one more crystal--

01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:08.425 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:08.425 --> 01:31:13.720 align:middle line:90%


01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.200 align:middle line:90%
We are growing.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.310 align:middle line:90%
We are evolving.

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:17.500 align:middle line:90%
It's happening, folks.

01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:18.620 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And part of the evidence
that's happening

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:27.280 align:middle line:84%
is that you see it emerge at
the highest level of thinking

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.110 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And you know, of
course, technology

01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:34.730 align:middle line:90%
can be developed from this.

01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Of course, some
amazing technology

01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:39.740 align:middle line:84%
can be developed from this,
technology that will bring us

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to the stars, that will give us
infinite amount of energy, that

01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:49.610 align:middle line:84%
will free us from the shackles
of gravity, that will allow us

01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:53.540 align:middle line:84%
to have infinite
amount of resources

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and free humanity
from the destruction

01:31:56.810 --> 01:32:00.170 align:middle line:84%
that it's producing
in its environment

01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:01.670 align:middle line:90%
so that it can survive.

01:32:01.670 --> 01:32:04.420 align:middle line:90%
This is the key.

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.490 align:middle line:90%
There is no other way.

01:32:07.490 --> 01:32:08.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the path.

01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:13.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the discovery of the
fundamental connected nature

01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
of the universe and the energy
available to us as a result.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.700 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:22.560 align:middle line:90%
This is happening, folks.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:23.360 align:middle line:90%
It's happening.

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:25.040 align:middle line:90%
And people are realizing.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:26.270 align:middle line:90%
And it needs support.

01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:29.870 align:middle line:84%
It needs your support,
every one of you.

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't just
mean financially.

01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean in your consciousness,
in your awareness,

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
in your time that you
spend every day connecting

01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
with the universal connected
structure of space,

01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that every moment you can
spend connecting within you,

01:32:53.980 --> 01:33:01.600 align:middle line:84%
listening to the music of the
universe, removing the veils,

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.860 align:middle line:90%
opening.

01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Every one of your
efforts, you coming here,

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.660 align:middle line:84%
every one of your
efforts matters.

01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And technology is
starting to emerge

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.030 align:middle line:84%
from the corporations and the
efforts of our research group.

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:23.600 align:middle line:90%


01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Community, the Resonance Project
Foundation, we have a course,

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.470 align:middle line:90%
the Delegate program.

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:37.650 align:middle line:10%
And we just launched the
Delegate program in French.

01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:43.440 align:middle line:84%
We welcome the French community
to our global community

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.600 align:middle line:90%
at the Resonance Project.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But this is more
than just a course.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a community
that is growing.

01:33:50.050 --> 01:33:51.450 align:middle line:90%
We meet every month.

01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
all this stuff.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And you can ask me
questions, and we

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:59.760 align:middle line:84%
have a wonderful, amazing time
developing all this together.

01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.200 align:middle line:90%
So participate.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we go across the world
to ancient civilization sites,

01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:13.920 align:middle line:84%
sites that clearly shows
that some people a very

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:18.510 align:middle line:84%
long time ago figured this
out on our planet and left

01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
remains that are far more
ancient than what was first

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.250 align:middle line:90%
associated with them.

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And so the next trips
are to Rapa Nui.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.320 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be amazing.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:35.550 align:middle line:90%
We just-- we did Egypt, Peru.

01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We're doing the Orion
Belt on the Earth.

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And Rapa Nui is the
end of the belt.

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we're doing that
in April or May, April.

01:34:47.490 --> 01:34:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And then-- oh, yeah, spring.

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And then this
summer, we're going

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.960 align:middle line:84%
to gather in Santa Cruz for
an amazing time together

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:02.250 align:middle line:84%
and development and discussion
with all the research group.

01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:06.300 align:middle line:90%
And then Mexico.

01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.880 align:middle line:90%
This is our research team.

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We have amazing scientists
working on this,

01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's growing very fast.

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Val Baker that's here.

01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.570 align:middle line:90%
Johanna, Johanna over there.

01:35:21.570 --> 01:35:23.138 align:middle line:90%
Stand up, Johanna.

01:35:23.138 --> 01:35:26.930 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:30.450 align:middle line:90%
Amazing, enlightened doctor.

01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And Ines, PhD in
physics, chemistry.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.300 align:middle line:90%
William is not here.

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Jeremy?

01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Jeremy?

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Not here.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And Olivier.

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:47.840 align:middle line:90%
But we have more than that.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:55.460 align:middle line:84%
We have a large staff
working across three

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.900 align:middle line:90%
different corporations.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The Resonance Science Foundation
is our non-profit corporation.

01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And Torus Tech is our
for-profit research laboratory.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And then ARK is a
company that's starting

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.370 align:middle line:84%
to bring some of that
technology out into the world.

01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to invite all of
our staff onstage right now.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Come on, you guys.

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.428 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:21.428 --> 01:36:23.380 align:middle line:90%


01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:24.190 align:middle line:90%
Come on, you guys.

01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:27.310 align:middle line:90%


01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Chris, Brian,
Johanna, here we go.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Teresa, director of the
Resonance Science Foundation

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Academy, Scott Brown, chief
technology officer, Chris,

01:36:54.690 --> 01:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
our CEO at ARK and Torus Tech.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And then Andrea that
makes it possible

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.280 align:middle line:84%
for us to have a clue what
we're supposed to do when.

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> On the subconscious
of the group.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm the subconscious.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> On the subconscious.

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you're the subconscious
of the whole thing.

01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Brian, CEO of the Resonance
Science Foundation.

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:30.980 align:middle line:10%
And of course, Maura that
can do 2 million things

01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:37.040 align:middle line:10%
at the same time
across all universes.

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
everybody, for being there.

01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:44.840 align:middle line:10%
These guys work
tirelessly to make

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.470 align:middle line:10%
this happen because they're
not just there for a paycheck.

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:52.320 align:middle line:84%
They work so that humanity
can go to the next level.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:55.010 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

01:37:55.010 --> 01:37:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And nothing of this could
be possible without you.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:04.640 align:middle line:10%
So thank you to you for being
here, and supporting this,

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:05.795 align:middle line:10%
and making it happen.

01:38:05.795 --> 01:38:08.515 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

01:38:08.515 --> 01:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%


01:38:11.850 --> 01:38:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And we have a table
back there you

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:18.050 align:middle line:10%
can go to, and
come to our booth,

01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:21.080 align:middle line:10%
and come and check
out the Residence--

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:24.410 align:middle line:10%
the ARK crystals and the
technology that's developing.

01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:29.330 align:middle line:84%
Come on Monday, and we can
talk about it some more.

01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:31.202 align:middle line:90%
OK, you guys, thank you.

01:38:31.202 --> 01:38:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Come see us after.

01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:36.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Good job.

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:37.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:44.180 align:middle line:90%


01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:49.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, because I keep
giving these talks by myself,

01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:52.410 align:middle line:84%
because they just throw me
in the teeth of the lion.

01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And they go, oh, you're
good, you can do it.

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't do
it without them.

01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:01.520 align:middle line:90%
I could not do it without them.

01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:02.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not a one-man band.

01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:04.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't do
it without you.

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%


01:39:09.230 --> 01:39:16.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure there's
not too many questions.

01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Let's do some questions.

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:19.428 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:39:19.428 --> 01:39:21.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Inside it.

01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:24.460 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, we need a mic
for the questions.

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.570 align:middle line:90%
Do we have an extra mic?

01:39:25.570 --> 01:39:29.480 align:middle line:90%


01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.870 align:middle line:90%
Right, so I'll give you my mic.

01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'll use the
one on the podium.

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, Euler's formula, part 1.

01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:41.960 align:middle line:90%
The second question is--

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Euler's formula, yeah,
very good, very good.

01:39:44.690 --> 01:39:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The second point
is, in science,

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you have facts and you
have interpretations.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.990 align:middle line:84%
It's useful to distinguish
between the two.

01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:56.510 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as the facts are
shown regarding the spinning

01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:59.883 align:middle line:84%
vibrations that
manifest protons,

01:39:59.883 --> 01:40:02.300 align:middle line:84%
what's interesting to consider
about that is that spinning

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:07.010 align:middle line:84%
vibration assumes that that
equidistant circular motion

01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:09.268 align:middle line:84%
revolves around a
singularity point.

01:40:09.268 --> 01:40:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And that singularity
point in and of itself

01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:14.070 align:middle line:84%
doesn't take up any
space on its own.

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:17.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words, one could
look at that singularity point

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.910 align:middle line:84%
as a zero point
of-- that could be

01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:24.600 align:middle line:84%
a fractal of the universal
mind, an infinitesimal.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.600 align:middle line:84%
In other words, an
interpretation of this theory

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:30.380 align:middle line:84%
would be that it is mind,
and that energy is thought,

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.630 align:middle line:84%
and that is how thought
manifests matter.

01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.860 align:middle line:84%
That's why you'd have a
singularity at the center

01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:38.280 align:middle line:90%
of the atom, right?

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:39.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, if you
have angular momentum,

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:45.740 align:middle line:84%
if you have circular
motion, it's

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.610 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
gravitational field.

01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it goes straight.

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:54.250 align:middle line:90%
It's held to the center.

01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
consciousness is information

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:02.980 align:middle line:84%
flowing towards the
center, the way you

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.920 align:middle line:90%
made this interpretation.

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so then consciousness act
on itself and radiate out.

01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Your body radiates
thermodynamically,

01:41:15.490 --> 01:41:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and you do things that make
it radiate thermodynamically

01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:20.450 align:middle line:90%
throughout the day.

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:30.350 align:middle line:84%
It could be some very strong
thermodynamic radiation

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:35.060 align:middle line:84%
at night as well for
some various reasons.

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:40.580 align:middle line:84%
But there is continuous
radioactivity--

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:43.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, thermodynamic activity.

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine that
the information flowing out

01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is the electromagnetic
field, the thermal function

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.890 align:middle line:84%
of the singularity
of the black hole.

01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And the two feed
back onto itself.

01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
goes from the edge,

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.810 align:middle line:84%
circulating information to the
center, and back to the edge.

01:42:06.810 --> 01:42:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And the system is self driven
in a continuous feedback, speed

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:16.500 align:middle line:84%
forward loop, creating
the spin of creation.

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.610 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

01:42:17.610 --> 01:42:18.620 align:middle line:90%
Nice.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'll definitely
consider Euler's equations.

01:42:23.610 --> 01:42:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:27.694 align:middle line:90%
Can you pass the mic?

01:42:27.694 --> 01:42:30.430 align:middle line:90%


01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, just a quick
comment and a question.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like anyone that
master's interstellar travel

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:41.240 align:middle line:84%
has had to understand
information and consciousness.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And that would
help to explain why

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.290 align:middle line:84%
there is so much
what we would call

01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:48.590 align:middle line:84%
paranormal phenomena in
connection with UFOs,

01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:50.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's all of one piece.

01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:52.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:42:52.153 --> 01:42:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I think, like, a
lot of the things

01:42:53.570 --> 01:42:56.900 align:middle line:84%
we call para phenomenon
are just physics

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.380 align:middle line:90%
we haven't understood yet.

01:42:58.380 --> 01:42:59.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:42:59.180 --> 01:43:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The stuff we call
spirituality, or like,

01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:08.810 align:middle line:84%
you know, all these esoteric
knowledge and so on, I think,

01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:13.290 align:middle line:84%
is just physics that we haven't
wrote the equations for yet.

01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And the quick question
is, when a proton escapes

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.410 align:middle line:84%
to form another
universe, is that

01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:20.371 align:middle line:90%
governed by quantum tunneling?

01:43:20.371 --> 01:43:25.290 align:middle line:90%


01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, that's a
complex question.

01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Is it governed by
quantum tunneling?

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:33.040 align:middle line:90%
Partly.

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But it depends how you
define quantum tunneling.

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
fully defined, right?

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So it is in the function in
which the entanglement produces

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:57.260 align:middle line:84%
a correlation between
places in space.

01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:59.800 align:middle line:90%


01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:04.160 align:middle line:10%
So there's a quantum function
in information transfer

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:10.790 align:middle line:10%
across the boundary of
the entanglement that

01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:12.840 align:middle line:10%
would define--

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:20.690 align:middle line:10%
so basically, are you
asking if this system then

01:44:20.690 --> 01:44:22.640 align:middle line:10%
is predetermined?

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm asking more if there
is a barrier to escaping

01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:27.530 align:middle line:90%
the universe?

01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Classically, it would
be a hard barrier.

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:33.080 align:middle line:84%
But quantum mechanically,
there would be tunneling.

01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:44:34.690 --> 01:44:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just wondering if that
is an instance when the proton

01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:41.070 align:middle line:84%
escapes the black hole of this
universe to form another one.

01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Very good, that's-- what
I'm saying is that there is

01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:53.120 align:middle line:84%
functions in the structure
of space time that makes it

01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:58.760 align:middle line:84%
so that at the event horizon,
right where the inside

01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.060 align:middle line:84%
of the event horizon
interacts with the surface,

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:05.020 align:middle line:84%
or the outside of
the event horizon,

01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:09.740 align:middle line:84%
there's an information
correlation exchange that

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:13.730 align:middle line:84%
produces this tunneling
effect, this exchange between

01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:16.850 align:middle line:84%
the outside and the inside,
which is something you see even

01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:21.740 align:middle line:84%
at the biological level
on the surface of cells.

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:24.620 align:middle line:90%
And so it's very much--

01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:28.850 align:middle line:84%
you can think of it
as quantum tunneling.

01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's more--
it has more to do

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:37.400 align:middle line:84%
with the geometry, the structure
of the geometry of the event

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:43.550 align:middle line:84%
horizon going through
transformation and correlation.

01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:49.032 align:middle line:90%


01:45:49.032 --> 01:45:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:54.630 align:middle line:84%
My question, is there actually
information transfer, actually

01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:56.530 align:middle line:90%
information communication?

01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:58.590 align:middle line:10%
Because you are talking
about entanglement.

01:45:58.590 --> 01:46:00.760 align:middle line:10%
And there is actually
no communication.

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:03.000 align:middle line:10%
There is information transfer.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.710 align:middle line:84%
It has happened--
maybe you could

01:46:04.710 --> 01:46:06.170 align:middle line:90%
say it has happened before.

01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:06.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:07.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:46:07.770 --> 01:46:11.460 align:middle line:10%
So when these
universes are created,

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:14.730 align:middle line:10%
there is actually no
information transfer

01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:15.870 align:middle line:10%
as far as I can understand.

01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:17.640 align:middle line:10%
Is that right?

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.880 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:20.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you explain that?

01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:25.120 align:middle line:90%


01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.500 align:middle line:90%
So think of it this way.

01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:35.850 align:middle line:10%
You know how you have
these systems, where

01:46:35.850 --> 01:46:38.430 align:middle line:10%
you have a bunch of
balls on strings,

01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and then you pull one
ball, and you let it

01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:43.620 align:middle line:10%
go, and whack the other balls.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And they don't move, but
the other ball on the end

01:46:46.410 --> 01:46:47.970 align:middle line:90%
goes like this.

01:46:47.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.810 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it a
little bit like that,

01:46:52.810 --> 01:46:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that if all volumes are one
volume because they're all

01:46:58.970 --> 01:47:04.760 align:middle line:84%
entangled, any variation
in any of the volume

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:11.690 align:middle line:84%
has a correlated effect on all
other volumes in the universe.

01:47:11.690 --> 01:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why entanglement
occurs in the first place.

01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:18.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, the reason why--

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:23.210 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that
if those are not

01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:26.690 align:middle line:84%
traversable in
terms of information

01:47:26.690 --> 01:47:28.570 align:middle line:90%
is because there is decoherence.

01:47:28.570 --> 01:47:31.130 align:middle line:90%


01:47:31.130 --> 01:47:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, decoherence is an
illusion from our perspective,

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:41.000 align:middle line:90%
from our point of observation.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.750 align:middle line:84%
So we say this particle
on the end of my finger

01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:49.160 align:middle line:84%
is not correlated or is
not entangled with that one

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:49.970 align:middle line:90%
over there.

01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:47:50.770 --> 01:47:53.420 align:middle line:90%


01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have this impression
that when two particles are

01:47:56.510 --> 01:48:02.630 align:middle line:84%
entangled, if one is
observed, it decoheres

01:48:02.630 --> 01:48:04.730 align:middle line:90%
from the entanglement.

01:48:04.730 --> 01:48:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so there is no
information transfer.

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Although when I modify
this one, this one

01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:15.570 align:middle line:84%
modifies instantaneously, even
if it's across the universe.

01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:20.030 align:middle line:10%
However, the assumption
is that you always

01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:22.820 align:middle line:10%
have the two ends of
the entanglement, which

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.510 align:middle line:10%
is incorrect,
meaning this particle

01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:30.290 align:middle line:10%
on the end of my finger can be
entangled with another particle

01:48:30.290 --> 01:48:32.040 align:middle line:10%
on the other side the universe.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.580 align:middle line:10%
And when I tickle
this one, I'm not

01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:39.020 align:middle line:10%
hearing the other one laughing,
because I don't have access

01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:39.840 align:middle line:10%
to it.

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So the only pairs that
I'm able to observe

01:48:43.190 --> 01:48:46.700 align:middle line:84%
both ends of the
tunnel, of the wormhole,

01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:50.540 align:middle line:84%
is the ones that
I can correlate.

01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So the information
is transferred.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just I can't measure it.

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:48:56.960 --> 01:48:57.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:48:57.425 --> 01:48:58.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:01.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, my pleasure.

01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:05.990 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you arrive at
the Planck pixel as being

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:07.700 align:middle line:10%
the smallest particle?

01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.820 align:middle line:10%
And what does that have to do
with the uncertainty principle?

01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:14.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So I arrive to it--

01:49:14.090 --> 01:49:15.350 align:middle line:10%
that's a good question.

01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I arrived to it as a result
of the size of the universe,

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.830 align:middle line:84%
as a result of the
scale of the universe.

01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Think of the scale
of the universe

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:29.810 align:middle line:90%
has the longest wavelength.

01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you chop
it down, and chop it

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:38.930 align:middle line:84%
down, and go through all the
harmonics, the scale harmonics.

01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get
to the speed of light

01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
in the wavelength, you
get to the Planck size.

01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And so that produces
a fundamental limit

01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:58.050 align:middle line:90%
at the smallest scale.

01:49:58.050 --> 01:50:01.740 align:middle line:84%
That produces the fundamental
pixel of creation.

01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:05.010 align:middle line:84%
>> It's similar to the
Millikan oil drop experiment,

01:50:05.010 --> 01:50:07.350 align:middle line:84%
arriving at the size of the
electron, or mass electron.

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Very same charge, excuse me.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the second part
of your question?

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:16.740 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it related to
the uncertainty principle?

01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So it relates to the uncertainty
principle in the sense

01:50:22.650 --> 01:50:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that the uncertainty
occurs in our equation

01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:29.520 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
access to the whole network.

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And since the thing is
completely entangled,

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.980 align:middle line:84%
you can think of an
electron as being

01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:37.330 align:middle line:90%
everywhere at the same time.

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:42.120 align:middle line:84%
So it sucks to try to figure
out exactly where it is.

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So when you try to
pinpoint where it is,

01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:46.690 align:middle line:84%
you can't figure out
where it's going.

01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you pinpoint
where it's going,

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:52.770 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea where it is
because it's all entangled.

01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So uncertainty creeps
in the equations.

01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:58.858 align:middle line:90%
Brilliant, brilliant lecture.

01:50:58.858 --> 01:50:59.814 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:50:59.814 --> 01:51:00.770 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

01:51:00.770 --> 01:51:04.600 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no more question.

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You guys figured it all out.

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.920 align:middle line:10%
>> I have one.

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.900 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, over there.

01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.486 align:middle line:10%
Oh.

01:51:13.486 --> 01:51:16.130 align:middle line:10%
You might have to fight for it.

01:51:16.130 --> 01:51:19.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:24.050 align:middle line:10%
This question is actually in
response to the Einstein's 2013

01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:26.250 align:middle line:10%
paper on vacuous
photon production

01:51:26.250 --> 01:51:27.950 align:middle line:10%
producing a steady state.

01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:31.310 align:middle line:10%
Since he's not here, you
get to answer it for me.

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:34.820 align:middle line:10%
So I was under the
impression that in order--

01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:38.230 align:middle line:10%
well, first of all, our
universe is expansive.

01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:39.710 align:middle line:10%
It's expanding.

01:51:39.710 --> 01:51:45.260 align:middle line:10%
But also, in order to create
or extract energy, at least,

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:50.090 align:middle line:10%
out of a vacuous space,
you need a disequilibrium.

01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:54.310 align:middle line:10%
So I am trying to understand
how to bridge the gap of both

01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:59.210 align:middle line:10%
the necessity to have both,
one side either expanding

01:51:59.210 --> 01:52:03.210 align:middle line:10%
or contracting at
equilibrium state,

01:52:03.210 --> 01:52:05.600 align:middle line:10%
and also, this
steady state concept.

01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.320 align:middle line:10%
If you could please elaborate.

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.120 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yeah.

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.630 align:middle line:90%
This is a really good question.

01:52:09.630 --> 01:52:11.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's just not--

01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:13.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to try to give
you a simple answer.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not a simple answer.

01:52:14.630 --> 01:52:16.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
the universe is

01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:19.730 align:middle line:84%
vastly more complex
in its mechanics

01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:22.640 align:middle line:90%
than our simple models.

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's an error
we've done in assessing

01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:27.810 align:middle line:90%
the expansion of the universe.

01:52:27.810 --> 01:52:29.750 align:middle line:90%
So you can have two things.

01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can have
a bunch things,

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.870 align:middle line:84%
but at least you
can have two things.

01:52:33.870 --> 01:52:37.010 align:middle line:90%
One is that you can have--

01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:39.410 align:middle line:84%
think of the bubble of
the universe expanding.

01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So you can have this
linear expansion, right?

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:47.150 align:middle line:84%
But inside the expansion, you
can have things expanding away

01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:52.490 align:middle line:84%
from each other as they
circulate inside that expanding

01:52:52.490 --> 01:52:53.510 align:middle line:90%
bubble.

01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:middle line:90%
Do you see that?

01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.810 align:middle line:84%
So that from any point of
view inside the movement--

01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:01.670 align:middle line:84%
like, think of the
stars in the galaxy.

01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:05.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, we know they
go from the galactic disk

01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:09.260 align:middle line:84%
out into the halo, and then
they go up into the halo.

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And then they come back
down and then go around.

01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So from any of the
perspectives inside there,

01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:18.260 align:middle line:84%
we could see objects
moving away from us

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:23.250 align:middle line:84%
as they expand to the
halo bubble of the galaxy.

01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:25.070 align:middle line:10%
So it would all be blueshift--

01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:31.340 align:middle line:10%
it would all be redshifted with
very little blue shifted stuff.

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And it would look
like expansion to us.

01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:53:34.610 --> 01:53:38.540 align:middle line:10%
And then at the same time
that this is circulating,

01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:41.990 align:middle line:10%
the bubble could be
linearly expanding as well

01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:47.240 align:middle line:10%
until it reaches equilibrium
in the new density state

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.800 align:middle line:10%
when it escaped
the other universe.

01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:53.670 align:middle line:10%
The proton escaped this
huge pressure differential.

01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:57.260 align:middle line:10%
All the information
inside expands it out.

01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And then it slows--

01:53:58.910 --> 01:54:01.670 align:middle line:84%
well, it accelerates
for a long time.

01:54:01.670 --> 01:54:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, it would
find the equilibrium and stop.

01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.850 align:middle line:10%
But the dynamics inside that
universe would continue.

01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:13.280 align:middle line:10%
And it would still
look like expansion.

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:16.580 align:middle line:10%
>> So you're saying that both
his paper and your paper take

01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:19.790 align:middle line:10%
into account both the
redshift of the expansion,

01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:25.190 align:middle line:10%
and then on the inverse side
of the hyper-superluminal

01:54:25.190 --> 01:54:27.030 align:middle line:10%
component that's
going blueshift.

01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:29.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's all one component.

01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
it's a net zero?

01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:34.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, very good.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Wow, great questions.

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:41.050 align:middle line:10%
We're getting a technical
crowd over here.

01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:44.900 align:middle line:10%
Laurie, my favorite
dentist in the world.

01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:46.370 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, Dr. Laurie.

01:54:46.370 --> 01:54:51.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it true that you practiced
breatharianism through--

01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>> It is.

01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:57.120 align:middle line:84%
I was a breatharian
for three years.

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- you know,
I just basically forgot

01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:04.580 align:middle line:90%
to eat for a while.

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And then it occurred
to me that, hey, I'm

01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:10.010 align:middle line:84%
writing equations saying
the whole thing is

01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:11.330 align:middle line:90%
living on the vacuum.

01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:13.550 align:middle line:90%
So like, why am I eating?

01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept on going because
it was a hell of a lot cheaper,

01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:22.800 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't have much money.

01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:30.550 align:middle line:84%
So it was really a
result of a need.

01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:34.810 align:middle line:90%


01:55:34.810 --> 01:55:42.500 align:middle line:10%
And so, you know, for the most
part of the three-year period,

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:49.040 align:middle line:10%
either didn't eat at all or I
ate very little, drank water.

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:52.070 align:middle line:10%
And then for the last six
months of that period,

01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:53.930 align:middle line:10%
I barely drank any water.

01:55:53.930 --> 01:55:55.250 align:middle line:10%
I got to get out of here?

01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it is possible
to live directly

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.590 align:middle line:90%
of the structure of the vacuum.

01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:04.310 align:middle line:10%
When you're ingesting
the material world,

01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:07.490 align:middle line:10%
you're ingesting
the vacuum energy

01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:10.760 align:middle line:10%
that you're extracting
from it to feed the vacuum

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.530 align:middle line:10%
energy inside your body that
you're losing as your body

01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:17.540 align:middle line:10%
radiates thermodynamically.

01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:19.700 align:middle line:90%
You can bypass that.

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done by
many people at this point.

01:56:23.010 --> 01:56:26.720 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't know
that was called breatharianism

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:28.440 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.200 align:middle line:90%
I just did by necessity.

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But many people around the
world are doing it now.

01:56:34.670 --> 01:56:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's being studied by
very serious scientists.

01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shown that
you can feed directly

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:46.130 align:middle line:90%
of the structure of space.

01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So you know, that's an
interesting possibility.

01:56:50.210 --> 01:56:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And it shows that you
can create technology

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:55.850 align:middle line:90%
that does the exact same thing.

01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:58.100 align:middle line:90%
You can create technology.

01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And it does not violate
the laws of physics.

01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:03.770 align:middle line:84%
It does not violate
conservation.

01:57:03.770 --> 01:57:07.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just that there's
technology, just like the body,

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:11.960 align:middle line:84%
that can extract energy from
the field of energy that was not

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:13.950 align:middle line:90%
known to be there before.

01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Just like before Faraday, he
moved a magnet over a coil

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and realize he could
get an electric field,

01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:25.850 align:middle line:84%
it was unknown that there
was an energy such as this

01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:27.300 align:middle line:90%
that could be extracted.

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.860 align:middle line:84%
We're just
discovering new levels

01:57:30.860 --> 01:57:34.040 align:middle line:84%
of that energy, which
are nothing different

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:38.090 align:middle line:84%
than the magnetic field in
a permanent magnet moving

01:57:38.090 --> 01:57:39.380 align:middle line:90%
across a coil.

01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:43.370 align:middle line:84%
That is just as much vacuum
energy as any other energy

01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:46.640 align:middle line:84%
because the magnetic
field of that magnet

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.250 align:middle line:84%
comes from the protons
and electrons that

01:57:49.250 --> 01:57:50.810 align:middle line:90%
makes up the magnet.

01:57:50.810 --> 01:57:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And those guys are getting
it from the vacuum.

01:57:54.180 --> 01:57:57.180 align:middle line:90%
So it's already all there.

01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:02.870 align:middle line:10%
We just got to plug
in to the vacuum power

01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:05.360 align:middle line:10%
and go for the stars.

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:08.390 align:middle line:10%
So thank you so much, everybody.

01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:10.680 align:middle line:10%
I love you all.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:13.910 align:middle line:10%
And until next time, may
the vacuum be with you.

01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:16.010 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:19.010 align:middle line:90%
