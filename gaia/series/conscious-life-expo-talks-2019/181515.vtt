00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.230 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.830 align:middle line:90%
We're good?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the most exciting
expo in the country.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.760 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:90%
This is where all happens.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:10%
Let's give this whole thing--

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.890 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
My name's Alan Steinfeld.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:90%
I come from New York.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.580 align:middle line:84%
But I do these events,
host them because--

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and I really wanted to
introduce my good friend here.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.350 align:middle line:90%
We do a lot of shows together.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, I
just want to say

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
he is one of the
nicest, kindest,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:84%
most genuine people in the UFO
business, in the UFO industry.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:90%
So let's give Robert Perala a--

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
he has real experiences, and
he only shares his truth.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.475 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, Robert.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, my friend.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Alan.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, guys.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%
What a wonderful,
incredible expo.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank Gaia TV--

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.155 align:middle line:84%
wow-- for coming out
here, filming this today.

00:01:05.155 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
What a marvelous outfit they
are that showcases spirituality,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
holistic health, the esoteric
sciences, personal growth,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:84%
anecdotes for living,
and yes, today,

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.752 align:middle line:84%
the incredible and
sensational extraterrestrials.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a few
things, just a little bit

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.610 align:middle line:84%
about the beginning and how
this all kind of got started.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I can tell you
that a lot of people

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:84%
aren't still quite
ready for this.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you've seen
everything imaginable

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
happen in your lifetime,
you'll look at this

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and say, wow, what's next?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Incredibly, extraterrestrials,
in our lifetime.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
How could this have happened?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's right
underneath our noses.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You ever notice TV, television,
motion pictures, the internet

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and everything is designed just
to get you used to the idea.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen this happen?

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed that
throughout the ages

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.301 align:middle line:90%
we have seen this in everything?

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
Tonight, we're going to
see a number of things.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk about the
ascension of planet Earth.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:10%
Because the Earth
is actually being

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:10%
birthed into a slightly
larger expression, and that's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.220 align:middle line:10%
happening from a
number of sources.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:10%
Via people that are in the
technological sectors, people

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:10%
that are in aerospace, Tesla.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.217 align:middle line:90%
All these things are happening.

00:02:29.217 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about, what are we

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.780 align:middle line:84%
going to do about the
extraterrestrials?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are awake and
realize, wow, it's here.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's very sort of a little
bit clandestined at first.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a little bit hidden away.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
more and more people

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:84%
are actually making,
incredibly, contact.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of you will
see tonight that it

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
started for me very early.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
In 1977 on December 27, I
was taken aboard a spacecraft

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
by what looked like
three astronauts.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, that seems incredible.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine
after it was over,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
I locked myself in my
apartment for three months.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to see
anything like that ever again.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And my parents say, don't say
a word to anybody about this.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't talk about this.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.190 align:middle line:90%
It's just too strange.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:84%
We have friends, neighbors,
and family to think about.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, I can't help that.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.653 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't go public until
'93 in my first lecture.

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:31.820 align:middle line:84%
There were wonderful people
coming out of that time.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
Gregg Braden.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:84%
A lot of us were sort of
coming out and talking

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.572 align:middle line:84%
about the sensational in
mystery schools and everything.

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:90%
Everything is possible.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.000 align:middle line:90%
Even the impossible.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's, maybe, a
real focal point tonight.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you
a little bit here.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.740 align:middle line:90%
These are my two books.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm contending
here in my first book,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.347 align:middle line:10%
"The Divine Blueprint," is
that we are all living out a--

00:03:55.347 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:10%
there's a blueprint.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:90%
There's a plan.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.370 align:middle line:90%
There's a blueprint.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
There actually is a
purpose and a directive

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.220 align:middle line:84%
for the incoming karmic
bound souls that are

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:90%
coming into the planet daily.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
karmic bound souls,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.730 align:middle line:84%
who have finished
their contract,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.048 align:middle line:84%
are sort of leaving
and have already

00:04:13.048 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled their contract.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind
of going on all day

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.589 align:middle line:84%
long while we're
sitting in traffic.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:90%
How can this be?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:10%
And so I've studied
that very carefully--

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.362 align:middle line:10%
the nature of existence, the
origin of the soul, which

00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:10%
is what this is called.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials and
the Origin of the Soul.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Because mankind is connected
to the stars in a fantastic way

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
we've never even
dreamed possible.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
And there have been--

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:84%
the Bible, the Gita,
the Sanskrit, the Torah,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.120 align:middle line:84%
the Sumerian tablets
have all sort of

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.480 align:middle line:84%
talked about visitors
being responsible

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.962 align:middle line:90%
for this experience.

00:04:48.962 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And then later on
as we're learning

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
from that, and from also modern
day prophets, and modern day

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.930 align:middle line:84%
channels and mystics,
in my own research,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
we find out that, wow, I see the
sort of karmic bound souls that

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
are here are actually related.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
You're actually related to
what the lost books of Job

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible talk about.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You are descendants of
the house of Pleiades.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And when it says that--

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.620 align:middle line:84%
the prophet must have
thought that was very

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:90%
important to put that in there.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Why would he take
all the time to say

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
you are descendants of
the house of Pleiades

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.520 align:middle line:90%
unless they meant it?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:10%
And then as we've kind of grown
into it, we find that there--

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:10%
what I'm contending in my
lecture, as you'll see here,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:10%
there are men and
women that are like you

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:10%
and I that have benefited
from greater time and greater

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:10%
knowledge.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They are, in fact from the
cluster of seven central suns,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.470 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiades.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Taygete, Maia, Electra,
Alycyone, Merope.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.885 align:middle line:90%
There's a couple of others.

00:05:53.885 --> 00:05:55.218 align:middle line:90%
And some of them are subjective.

00:05:55.218 --> 00:05:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Some will say it was more than
seven central suns and systems.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
But suffice to say that what
I'm contending in my research is

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
that men and women
are coming here

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that are just like
you and I. That have

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
benefited from greater time.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Extraterrestrials will always be
sort of sensationalized, right?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Because you see the
pictures in the motion

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.110 align:middle line:90%
pictures and the movies.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Creepy little gray guys with
big, almond shaped black eyes

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:90%
that don't move.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And they just telepath
something to you

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.050 align:middle line:90%
like you're for dinner tonight.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Like, what?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
That kind of thing happens.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:10%
But, actually, there are men
and women that are just like you

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:10%
and I that are walking right
amongst us, incredibly,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:10%
and they will live very quietly.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:10%
I have been working
with a Russian woman

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.190 align:middle line:10%
from the Ukraine--

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:10%
you'll see a little piece of
that in this presentation-- who

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:10%
has explained to
me and taken time

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.520 align:middle line:10%
with me to sit down and
explain how this works.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's amazing.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:90%
She needs an interpreter.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And I sit very quietly
with her and I say, tell

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.600 align:middle line:90%
me what is going on here.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll get into that
in the presentation.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But also what I'm
saying here in my books,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:90%
we are divine architects.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We are sent here as emissaries
to learn all the principles

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:90%
of life and existence.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.488 align:middle line:90%
We are like builders.

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So you might say a lot
of this presentation

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is also personal
growth oriented.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
It has a certain amount
of purpose and direction.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
We're not coming here to join
the worthless codependence

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.125 align:middle line:90%
club.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You're here by
divine appointment

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:90%
to learn lessons in mastery.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Relationship mastery, physical
mastery, emotional mastery.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people,
while they have already

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
been-- while they
have been born here,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.270 align:middle line:84%
they will completely deny
that anything is out there.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.580 align:middle line:84%
They will forget-- in the lost
books of Job and in the Bible,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.250 align:middle line:84%
it says you are wearing
the veils of forgetfulness.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that coded
in the actual field

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of your body, the field--
its gigantic rainbow

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:90%
that you can't see.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people can with
clairvoyance, or what

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:90%
have you--

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that it's encoded
in there that you're

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate your lessons
and your directive here.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.290 align:middle line:84%
You're here by appointment
to learn these-- as crazy

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:90%
as it looks out there.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you must
be saying, wait a minute.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:90%
There's been a terrible mistake.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't possibly have
been sent here for this.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.510 align:middle line:90%
With these people?

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.929 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.608 align:middle line:84%
Because there's-- and all
those people that you dislike

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:42.150 align:middle line:84%
the most or are
testing you the most.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.817 align:middle line:10%
And those are when
your lessons come up.

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:44.617 align:middle line:10%
All right?

00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:45.540 align:middle line:10%
They really do.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.290 align:middle line:10%
And those people that you
fall in love with, and find

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:10%
love mastery with, and
procreation with, they

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.990 align:middle line:10%
teach you an awful lot.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.377 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually
divine architects.

00:08:57.377 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what we were
contending in that book, which

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.783 align:middle line:84%
the new version of
the revised version

00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
is still coming out
this year, and we're

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%
looking forward to that.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.430 align:middle line:90%
So you are a builder.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.810 align:middle line:10%
So everything is possible,
even the impossible.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, this was
my world when I grew up.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I grew up amongst black
and white television.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:90%
I grew up with a dial up phone.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:10%
I grew up with a
group of women that

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:10%
came into our house that
were doing channeling

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.600 align:middle line:10%
and had seances, which,
in 1966, was incredible.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they used to say,
well, if the furniture

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:10%
is moving by itself, you're
probably at the Perala's house.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
reputation we had.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:48.440 align:middle line:10%
And so it was the era of
Kennedy and Martin Luther King.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.450 align:middle line:10%
I grew up in a house
that was filled

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:10%
with all kinds of wonderment.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I was exposed to a lot of
mystical things very early on.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:90%
I was lucky that way.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So you might say I got
a kind of a head start.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, I
grew up in the era

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.940 align:middle line:84%
where I was afraid
to be drafted.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I remember my dad said,
if you're not going--

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:90%
the draft?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:90%
you're not going to any Vietnam.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dad, what do you mean?

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, well-- he
says, we'll tell them

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that we are Christians.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.342 align:middle line:84%
We'll tell them that we're
born again and everything.

00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I said, Dad, you never took me
to church once in your life.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.110 align:middle line:90%
He says, we start Sunday.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So that was the kind of
crazy world I was growing--

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
but I was also growing
up with apparitions.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
These are men and
women like you and I.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And I would see people in the
middle of the night standing

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
there, semi-transparent,
and I would see them

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:90%
standing behind my teacher.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And I would talk about this,
and the teacher would send notes

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
home to my parents.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Robert seems to be
very distracted.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
He says he sees people
standing behind the teacher,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.005 align:middle line:84%
standing behind students,
and this scares the students.

00:11:10.005 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you please do
something about this?

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, you must have seen them.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.880 align:middle line:90%
You must have seen them.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
And they go, no.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So at that point,
for some reason,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
my second clairvoyant
sight was very developed.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I would see them walking in
their footsteps in their places

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and say, you must
have seen that.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And they go, no.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%
And they would say things to me.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Not necessarily direct me.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
They weren't saying, like,
oh, yes, young master Robert.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Take us to your leader.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:90%
No, there was nothing like that.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.930 align:middle line:84%
It was more witness to a
phenomenon that was going on.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.690 align:middle line:84%
They would be talking
to each other.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Some would walk through the wall
and then walk back in again.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:56.115 align:middle line:84%
And so I got the idea, OK,
we're walking amongst people.

00:11:56.115 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
We're walking amongst people
that are just like you

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
and I, that look just like you.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
What if what if I told you
that when someone has run out

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:84%
of time and they've
given up their body

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and they've simply
run out of time,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.710 align:middle line:84%
they step out of their
body, and then there's yes,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:90%
there's a life review.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:90%
And then there's also--

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.150 align:middle line:84%
there can be all of
the above is true.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:90%
We could go through that list.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:90%
But they're walking amongst you.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And you even hear them.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:84%
You will hear their
thoughts or what

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.858 align:middle line:84%
they say to you imparted
to you as your--

00:12:27.858 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
you will think it's
you because you hear it

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:90%
in your own mind's voice.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why when
they speak to you,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or they give you an inspiration,
or an idea, or an impression,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.348 align:middle line:84%
or you get that sixth sense
kind of like a warning-- like,

00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:41.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, I really
shouldn't do this.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't go there tonight--

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.850 align:middle line:84%
or I had a feeling about
this, that's your intuition.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.903 align:middle line:84%
That's them talking
to you, very often.

00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:50.320 align:middle line:84%
So they'll talk
to you, and you'll

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
hear it in your
own mind's voice,

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.093 align:middle line:90%
so it's not disconcerting.

00:12:54.093 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
That way you don't
suddenly turn around,

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you
hear, you know, your mother

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
that passed away three years
ago saying, now, wait a minute.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute, Billy.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.130 align:middle line:90%
You have a problem here.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.725 align:middle line:84%
Very disconcerting if you
started to hear that, you know?

00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, other people, you know,
walk in between the worlds,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and they can see them
and hear them, et cetera.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit of a
foundation of how this works.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And then those are
the discarnates.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They are like you and
I. They ran out of time.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Their physical body
no longer works.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And those discarnates
meet other people

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.240 align:middle line:84%
that are standing in
the perpetual moment.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.650 align:middle line:90%
The perpetual moment is--

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:84%
we have, say, the
sense of time, right?

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:46.300 align:middle line:84%
We have a minute, an hour, a
day, a week, a month, a year,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.100 align:middle line:90%
so on.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.090 align:middle line:90%
And we have distance, right?

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
They're living in
their perpetual moment.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
They don't notice
that distance the way

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
we do because we have
an aging process here.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit
about how it works.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And then later on,
some of them actually

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
semi-introduced
themselves to me.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's very difficult for--

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I think
about it, I think, really?

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Being on the other side,
that's a semi-torso apparition,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.260 align:middle line:90%
you know, talking to me?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a sinner.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Why would I be
endowed with this?

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
choose people that--

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe they
were choosing this

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.570 align:middle line:84%
because if this is a
mouthpiece from their world,

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:84%
from that side to this side,
maybe that is a part of it.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have to
stay in a lot of integrity

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:90%
and practice that.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:90%
Practice meditation.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Practice prayer.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Practice being on purpose here.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they'll move into
your life a little bit more

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:90%
because they see you're willing.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, something drew
you here, right?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.727 align:middle line:90%
Something drew you here.

00:14:56.727 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could've been
going to an Amway meeting

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:90%
or something like that, right?

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.127 align:middle line:84%
Or one of those
12 step meetings.

00:15:03.127 --> 00:15:04.960 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
meetings you can go to,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but something in your
spirit drew you here.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
So you are here by appointment.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:90%
You're in the right place.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.370 align:middle line:90%
So I was a kid--

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.810 align:middle line:90%
oh, let's go to pop culture.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:90%
This was it for me.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, I was turning
12 that summer.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Man, that's putting
my dreams way back.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And I had learned a little
bit about meditation

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:28.270 align:middle line:84%
all the way back when I was
only 12 years old by these four

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:90%
guys going to the Himalayas.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They went to see Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi in the Himalayas,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
where the Ganges River
meets the plains.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:90%
It's in what's called Rishikesh.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:10%
And they learned there
that thoughts were things,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.760 align:middle line:10%
and that they had the ability--

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:10%
thoughts-- to travel.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you send a thought
form into the universe,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
someone or something
might respond to that.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, incredible.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:59.583 align:middle line:84%
They asked John Lennon
when he got back--

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.000 align:middle line:84%
people forget that
John and George

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:84%
lived in an ashram for
just under three months

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.790 align:middle line:90%
at the end of '67 and into '68.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
People forget that
part, it's so long ago.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
They asked John Lennon
when they got back,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
what did you learn
with Maharishi?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:84%
This whole time you've
been meditating,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.760 align:middle line:84%
you've been locked away
in a remote area of India.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%
What did you learn?

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we learned
that you have to sit still

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:90%
or you're never going to know.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And the others were like, what?

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I get it.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:90%
You got to sit still.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
We're constantly bombarded
by the socio-conditioning,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
now today more than
ever before, right?

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
We have Wi-Fi signals.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Now 5G is coming.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Ah, help!

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I'm lit up
like a candle, you know?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We have-- I don't know if
that's going to work out.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It's snowing in Las
Vegas and Tucson.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they should
turn it back off.

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.840 align:middle line:90%
Anyway.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:90%
Seemed like a good idea.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.640 align:middle line:84%
But we're bombarded by all
kinds of things that distract us

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.852 align:middle line:90%
from our spirit, right?

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So I was really
fascinated by these guys.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.018 align:middle line:84%
I had to do pop culture because
people know me really well.

00:17:05.018 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:84%
They know I'll throw
in some fun stuff.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
You all remember
St. Paul, right?

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.670 align:middle line:90%
You remember St. John.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
You remember St. George, right?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And then there was St. Ringo.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.089 align:middle line:84%
We could never
figure this one out.

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
And so mysticism was
where it was at when

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:25.589 align:middle line:90%
I was-- so I was exposed to it.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
growing up, you're

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.090 align:middle line:84%
exposed to some
wonderful things.

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:90%
I was lucky.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
I got exposed to mysticism,
cosmic consciousness,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
meditation,
transferring thoughts

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
from the material plane
to the non material plane,

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:90%
calling to the universe.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.005 align:middle line:84%
That's a heady thing
for a 12-year-old.

00:17:43.005 --> 00:17:45.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, I remember some people
that would come over the house

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%
and say, don't talk about this.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.140 align:middle line:90%
You're scaring the family.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
What is this calling
to the universe?

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
You're 12 years
old and everything.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.675 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's important.

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're
here, aren't we?

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a very heady concept.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
We had this.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
The press, as I said, asked
John Lennon, what did you learn?

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And John said, we learned
that you had to sit still,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.080 align:middle line:90%
or you're never going to know.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
In 1977, 10 years later,
I was 22 years old.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
I was a pretty good
looking young man then.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a long ways.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Sideburns and bangs.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Wow, man.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I sure miss that part.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:31.245 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the mountains
of Lake Tahoe, Nevada,

00:18:31.245 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
right there where
the California border

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.770 align:middle line:84%
meets Nevada in the area of
what's called Heavenly Valley.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:90%
I was on a ski trip.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:39.875 align:middle line:84%
And I was reading books
like "Beyond Reality."

00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:43.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a little bit of
"Cosmic Fire" by Alice Bailey.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.850 align:middle line:90%
Very heady stuff.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.917 align:middle line:84%
And so I was reading
the Bhagavad Gita.

00:18:51.917 --> 00:18:53.250 align:middle line:90%
I was reading some other things.

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:56.395 align:middle line:84%
And so I learned
that, again, if you

00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:84%
send a thought
from the universe,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.260 align:middle line:84%
someone or something
might respond to that.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:84%
So I sat and I lit a candle
that night of the 26th.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.120 align:middle line:90%
It was the day after Christmas.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And everybody had
put the presents away

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:90%
and was starting to go to bed.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.110 align:middle line:84%
It was only my parents, my
sister, and her husband,

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:90%
and they went upstairs.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went outside
and I lit a candle.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And I just literally sent
a thought form like this.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:90%
Held my hands up.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.525 align:middle line:90%
I still remember it to this day.

00:19:24.525 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And said, if there's anything
out there, I'd like to know

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.650 align:middle line:84%
or I'd like to get to have
that experience or some point

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
of exchange to know that
there's something out there.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And it was very simple.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go on and
on and on about it.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.890 align:middle line:90%
I just was very simple.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Simple request.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I didn't
even believe it myself.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't expect anything
to really happen.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.592 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, well,
somewhere down the line,

00:19:54.592 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
some connection will be made.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Those apparitions who have,
actually at this point,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.970 align:middle line:84%
been less and less, at this
point, since I had grown up.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Since I had them many
times when I was young.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:90%
There was a long absence.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, maybe they'll
come back, because I'd never

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:90%
forgotten them.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:90%
And I went to bed.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
as in the middle

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.910 align:middle line:84%
of the night on the 27th,
probably somewhere around 2

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:84%
o'clock in the morning, it
seemed like the whole room

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
lit up like in an
arcing storm of flashes

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of blue, green, violet, indigo,
white light, silver white.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:90%
Like the sun had touched down.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
ceiling had opened up,

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and what came down into
the room was this--

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.290 align:middle line:84%
what looked like
three 8 and 1/2 foot

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:90%
tall astronauts of some kind.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain the
origin of the photo later.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:10%
But this is a very crude
photograph of what I saw.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So whatever this was, three
of them came into the room,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and it glowed like the sun.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't see the
field around it.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:90%
You see here-- that here--

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
that's a little
orange antenna that

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
stuck up about six
inches above his helmet.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:90%
He had a visor.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:17.780 align:middle line:90%
I saw no faces.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It was flat on the sides.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:10%
And you couldn't
see anyone inside.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The suit itself seemed to be
alive and glowed like the sun.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a very crude,
crude photograph.

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And the side of
the house opened up

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
into what looked like
a swirling tunnel.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, as I started to
scream, I went like this,

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly I was just
frozen, completely,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:84%
in what felt like a blue bubble,
a blue cocoon of some sort.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.483 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't move anything.

00:21:47.483 --> 00:21:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't move my arms,
my legs, or anything,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and I was just
frozen in this thing.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I could only hear my voice
as though it were almost

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:90%
in another room behind me.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And I was screaming,
you know, help me.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the side of the house

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
dropped away in what looked
like a swirling tunnel,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and I went through
the tunnel at what

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:84%
seemed like thousands
of miles an hour,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.072 align:middle line:90%
and it burned terrible.

00:22:10.072 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I would love to tell you that
those lovely stories that you

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
hear about near-death
experiences, you know--

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
that when the teary eyed
person say, I saw the light--

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:90%
that's not this story, actually.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
This story is one of terror,
and it was very painful.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And, at this point, I'm going
through this thing very,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:90%
very quickly.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't see these
whatever they are--

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
ultraterrestrials.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, at one
point, I had to surrender.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'll
just die, because you

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.230 align:middle line:90%
can't live when you're on fire.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:90%
You can't withstand that.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:90%
And so I surrendered to it.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%
And it was weird.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
As soon as I surrendered--
like I just surrendered.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll pass away.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll just surrender--
it, like, let go of me.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden, going
again at thousands of miles

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.320 align:middle line:90%
an hour through this tunnel.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.120 align:middle line:90%
It's burning again.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I surrendered,
and then it let go.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
I seemed to have almost
control over it somehow.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.080 align:middle line:84%
The next thing I
knew, I was sort

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.410 align:middle line:84%
of floating in this sphere,
spherical room of some sort,

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.105 align:middle line:84%
encased in this blue
light of some sort.

00:23:17.105 --> 00:23:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was in front
of what looked

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.728 align:middle line:90%
like an obelisk of some kind.

00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it was.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.300 align:middle line:90%
Some glass object.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And there was no one there.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
There was nobody
there to greet me.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.520 align:middle line:90%
There was no--

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to tell
that story, too.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, I met them, and
they were the emissaries.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
That's not this story.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I can only tell
the story the way

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I know how to tell the
story of what happened.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, whatever it was, I
went back through the tunnel,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and I was floating
above the bed,

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and I was lowered
down onto the bed.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And as whatever these were
had this lightning storm

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:10%
around them, eventually, they
seemed to just completely

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:10%
disappear, and the
ceiling closed up,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.980 align:middle line:10%
and the side of the house
closed up, and it was over.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying in my
bed, basically paralyzed.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea kind of
what had happened at all.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So I do remember at
one point throwing up

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:90%
over the side of the bed.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was in a convulsion.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was just
shaking, convulsion.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I later crawled out of the bed
and crawled along the floor

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and pulled myself up on
this vanity that-- you know,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the little sink
in the restroom--

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:90%
and turned on the light.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.678 align:middle line:90%
A I managed to pull myself up.

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And as I turned on
the light, I found

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I was sunburned from
head to toe and I

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
was soaked in like a honey
or like an oil material.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And needless to say, I never
want to see anything like that

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.610 align:middle line:90%
ever again.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when the morning
came, I had woke up--

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.460 align:middle line:84%
I was woken up and my
mother was looking at me.

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And she's going, wow,
you're so sunburned.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Something like, are you OK?

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And I was just looking around,
you know, and thinking,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
didn't anybody see
anything last night?

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, what?

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.483 align:middle line:84%
They never were
witness to anything.

00:25:21.483 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- a lot of times,
encounters can work like that.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
You can actually have
an encounter in one room

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:90%
and nothing in the other room.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.480 align:middle line:84%
They'll deny anything's even
happening because they isolate

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.390 align:middle line:90%
the experience, I guess.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So I'm one of the
oldest speakers

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.400 align:middle line:84%
at 63 years old in the
business, and I never

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
thought I was going
to be a speaker.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I never thought I was going
to do lectures and have

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.750 align:middle line:90%
book sales and all that.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
In 1978, in April 1978, I
opened up a UFO magazine.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow, they have a--

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.743 align:middle line:84%
I was starting to get
the idea that this was

00:25:53.743 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:90%
some kind of encounter maybe.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't quite there yet.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And I looked, and I thought,
they have a magazine on UFOs.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Maybe those silver things have
something to do with UFOs.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I was thumbing through,
I couldn't believe it.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.350 align:middle line:90%
There was a poster.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very crude, but there's
a poster of this somehow.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was taken by Jeff
Green Shaw, an off duty police

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.640 align:middle line:84%
officer in Falkville,
Alabama in October of 1973.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he had taken this shot--
and there's one after this.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's what I saw.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:90%
The lights are missing.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.610 align:middle line:90%
The incredible storm's missing.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.710 align:middle line:90%
The orange antenna's missing.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is missing, but
the basic shape is there.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So I met with Dr.
J. Allen Hynek.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:90%
I went to meet him.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
How many people know who
Dr. J. Allen Hynek is?

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So he's the guy who started
"Project Blue Book," which

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
was a TV show in 1978,
and now has been revised.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.220 align:middle line:90%
"Project Blue Book."

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It's on-- is it the
History Channel?

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Is it?

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:90%
So they revived it, right?

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
meet J. Allen Hynek.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.510 align:middle line:90%
I thought, wow, I've read it--

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.693 align:middle line:90%
all of it, about his research.

00:27:02.693 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was hardly-- there
was only maybe 22 of us

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:90%
there that day.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.570 align:middle line:84%
There was me, a scared,
young 22-year-old;

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
there was the Hurtaks--

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.570 align:middle line:84%
JJ and Desiree Hurtak
were there, who are--

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.090 align:middle line:84%
they are maybe the most read
on the pyramids that this--

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.553 align:middle line:90%
They're here this weekend.

00:27:19.553 --> 00:27:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I think they're
here this weekend.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.553 align:middle line:84%
And then they're on
tour and all that.

00:27:22.553 --> 00:27:23.910 align:middle line:90%
They do mini lectures.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:90%
There was Richard Hoagland.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew who he
was then, hardly.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.660 align:middle line:84%
He was just sort
of getting started.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.570 align:middle line:84%
There was Stanton
Friedman, who he's

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.222 align:middle line:90%
a big speaker in this field.

00:27:36.222 --> 00:27:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And then as I was
telling Richard--

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.580 align:middle line:84%
as I was telling Dr. Hynek
all about his experience,

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.825 align:middle line:90%
I was going on and on.

00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
and everything.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was this gentleman
who was sitting right next here,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get this--
remember the little cassette

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.670 align:middle line:90%
recorders we used to have?

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
You put the cassette
in, you close

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.260 align:middle line:84%
the little plastic window,
and you press play and record,

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.330 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I'm going
to get this on tape.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm meeting the go-to guy.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the go-to
guy in the UFO.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the man who's
recording people's experiences,

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and he actually
believes these people.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.890 align:middle line:90%
And I told him my story.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.140 align:middle line:90%
And this guy was bothering me.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.993 align:middle line:90%
He says, what else?

00:28:11.993 --> 00:28:12.930 align:middle line:90%
What else happened?

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.062 align:middle line:90%
And I go, hang on a second.

00:28:14.062 --> 00:28:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to make sure
that he got my story.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you want to make
some notes here and everything?

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
what else happened?

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, excuse me.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.825 align:middle line:84%
I'll be right with
you, and everything.

00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:84%
I was just really dead set
on getting my story told.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
About the third time this
person starts to interrupt me,

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.490 align:middle line:84%
I turn around, and
it's William Shatner.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.050 align:middle line:90%
Really.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine how
the universe works

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
as I'm going home that day
with my friend Dan and he said,

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:40.980 align:middle line:90%
that's great, Perala.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.250 align:middle line:90%
That's just great, man.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.633 align:middle line:84%
When you go public one day, and
you have a book and everything

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
like that, you go on TV,
and the Phil Donahue Show,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and all these kind
of things, you'll

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.665 align:middle line:84%
be able to tell them, the
first time you told your story,

00:28:51.665 --> 00:28:55.260 align:middle line:90%
you told it to Captain Kirk!

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, no.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.300 align:middle line:90%
That'll delegitimize the story.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's going to buy that.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
You don't tell your first UFO
encounter to Captain Kirk.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, don't do this.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:90%
He goes, yeah, man.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.620 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell everybody.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
And so he told all
of his friends.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Perala went and
met Hynek himself.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We saw the movie
"Close Encounters."

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.773 align:middle line:84%
He's the last guy in
one of the last scenes

00:29:17.773 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:90%
of "Close Encounters."

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.680 align:middle line:90%
You ever seen that?

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.808 align:middle line:84%
Where he comes up with
the pipe and they're

00:29:21.808 --> 00:29:23.850 align:middle line:84%
meeting the extraterrestrials
for the first time.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg
gave him a cameo.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So he always had
his pipe, right?

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And so he would be in the movie.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the real-- that's,
like, a real fictitious kind

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:33.750 align:middle line:90%
of encounter, right?

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Steven Spielberg makes
a movie with him in it.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:84%
So these beings,
whatever they are,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.080 align:middle line:84%
they had the ability to
appear and disappear at will.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:90%
This was the other shot of it.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, whatever these
are, they just

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.900 align:middle line:84%
seem to have the ability
to disappear and appear.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how long
I've been in the business.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a long time.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't go public,
as I said, until 1993.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.250 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, I start to
meet more and more interesting,

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:10.170 align:middle line:84%
fascinating people along the
way, who have been my teachers.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.040 align:middle line:90%
And so we look at this, we see--

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.840 align:middle line:84%
how many people have seen
this photograph, the Roswell

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:90%
photograph?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.730 align:middle line:84%
How many people
feel that it's real?

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Not many.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.790 align:middle line:90%
How many feel that it's fake?

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:90%
A lot more.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.497 align:middle line:84%
So no one's ever
really proven it.

00:30:26.497 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly it's an alien
autopsy, et cetera.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.037 align:middle line:90%
But it shows you--

00:30:30.037 --> 00:30:32.370 align:middle line:84%
it gets people used to the
idea that something was here,

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.470 align:middle line:90%
even as far back as 1947.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So right now, what's
happening to the Earth

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.150 align:middle line:84%
is the Earth is actually
being birthed into a larger

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:90%
expression.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.690 align:middle line:10%
The mystics have talked about
this time, where there's

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.570 align:middle line:10%
a merge between our
culture and a culture that

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.090 align:middle line:10%
is unseen in the unseen worlds.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw this in awareness
Awareness Act on the internet.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.100 align:middle line:84%
A galactic tidal
wave of divine light

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.480 align:middle line:84%
is raising the frequency of
earth, ending the old reality.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.660 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look at the
trivortex up in the North Pole

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and see that, in fact,
the planet is actually

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.153 align:middle line:84%
slightly shifted its axis,
and there is greater light

00:31:07.153 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:90%
coming to this planet.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's a
gigantic solar flare

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:14.073 align:middle line:84%
that's actually huge
tomorrow, incredibly,

00:31:14.073 --> 00:31:14.990 align:middle line:90%
that's due to be here.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:84%
There's actually a
split in the sun.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.140 align:middle line:84%
My wife just told me this
right before I got here.

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, you better
mentioned this.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it'll affect us.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.730 align:middle line:84%
But solar galactic waves and
things like that from the sun

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:31.050 align:middle line:84%
do have an effect on
us in a great way.

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:35.040 align:middle line:84%
So with that, if I tell
you that the Earth is

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.520 align:middle line:84%
sort of being prepared
and being surrounded,

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.020 align:middle line:84%
some of the theories say, well,
it's largely because the--

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe the
extraterrestrials don't

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.980 align:middle line:90%
want to lose this experience.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.950 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they're
watching over these souls that

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.150 align:middle line:90%
are being born each day.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that they
are part of what

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
we would call the spiritual
hierarchy or the Galactic

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Federation, if you want to get
kind of techie, kind of UFOy,

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:00.630 align:middle line:90%
kind of.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
lose this experience.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:84%
How many people here
read Barbara Marciniak?

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, the Pleiadians.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.810 align:middle line:90%
It's that channeled material.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Read "Path of Empowerment."

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.680 align:middle line:90%
What a remarkable book.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Man.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.570 align:middle line:84%
She describes it wonderfully,
and very eloquently,

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.710 align:middle line:84%
how this is all happening
and why us, as men and women,

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.300 align:middle line:90%
are from this cluster.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.740 align:middle line:90%
We're part of them.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:28.440 align:middle line:84%
This DNA process
is actually very

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.635 align:middle line:90%
largely a Pleiadian experience.

00:32:30.635 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you say that,
they're like, oh, god,

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.300 align:middle line:90%
he said the P word.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Pleiadian.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.080 align:middle line:90%
That sounds so far out.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:38.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like, ah.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, it sounds
like, oh, you know,

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a little bit sensational,
but that's where we're at.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is being birthed
into a slightly larger

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.070 align:middle line:90%
expression.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And as that happens--

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:90%
look at 5G even.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:55.290 align:middle line:90%
As they're sending up rockets--

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
I know, boo-- rockets
with these satellites.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And then you saw it on "60
Minutes" only three weeks ago,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.160 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And as the satellite
goes up, these

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.410 align:middle line:84%
sat-- how are they going to
put out 15,000 satellites?

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the size
of two bread loaves.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.755 align:middle line:84%
And they load them up
into the satellite.

00:33:13.755 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:84%
The satellite goes
up with the rocket.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.160 align:middle line:90%
They release the satellite.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.360 align:middle line:84%
They open up the bomb bay doors,
the guy looks down the scope,

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.190 align:middle line:90%
and he says, that's it.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.178 align:middle line:90%
Release them.

00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they all come
out, and they are actually

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.620 align:middle line:90%
circling the entire globe.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And they showed
even on "60 Minutes"

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that they could
see a butterfly fly

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.227 align:middle line:90%
from that bush to that bush.

00:33:34.227 --> 00:33:36.060 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of
detail that they can see.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.435 align:middle line:84%
They want to know
everything that

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:39.390 align:middle line:90%
is going on with this planet.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I really contend that,
in disclosure, they

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:84%
know full well that there's
another presence here.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing
that they can do

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.260 align:middle line:84%
is surround this in
a greater ability

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.533 align:middle line:84%
camera wise to see
what's happening here.

00:33:52.533 --> 00:33:53.950 align:middle line:84%
What's coming into
the atmosphere,

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:90%
what's leaving the atmosphere.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:57.210 align:middle line:90%
To see crime.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:90%
To see other things.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:90%
The bracelet is coming.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:84%
The people will wear-- that
will transfer everything,

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.830 align:middle line:84%
all your data, about what your
blood pressure is currently.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:90%
What's your A1C?

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it's not more
than 6.5 for diabetics.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:17.020 align:middle line:84%
That can be transferred with
5G to hospitals, et cetera.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:90%
You are living--

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry to say,
as you know already,

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:21.480 align:middle line:84%
you're living in the
surveillance state.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think it has a big
factor to do with disclosure.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.730 align:middle line:90%
It really does.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So UFOs are coming
here constantly.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The Pentagon has
taken shots of these

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.150 align:middle line:84%
just off the coast of
San Diego, et cetera.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And they zero in on
the targets, and they

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.630 align:middle line:84%
watch all these different
anomalies happen,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and then they report
in, you know, 6575 Echo.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.357 align:middle line:90%
We've got an anomaly here.

00:34:49.357 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you see something

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.550 align:middle line:90%
go by at 3,500 miles an hour.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And they know that there
is a presence here.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.753 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, as
all of us have said,

00:34:59.753 --> 00:35:01.670 align:middle line:84%
whether you're listening
to David Wilcock, who

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.500 align:middle line:84%
is a great guy,
you know, we're all

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.280 align:middle line:84%
saying that we are in the
throes of disclosure, actually.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.900 align:middle line:90%
We have this.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:90%
Oumuamua came in 2017.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the first
stellar object to pass

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
through our own solar
system at great speed.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't
usually see that.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.122 align:middle line:10%
Whether this is propelled--

00:35:26.122 --> 00:35:27.830 align:middle line:10%
they believe that it's
possibly propelled

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.950 align:middle line:10%
because an object that is
like a meteor passes through

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:35.690 align:middle line:10%
at the same galactic
speed, the same constant.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:38.390 align:middle line:10%
But why does this
one all of a sudden

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.750 align:middle line:10%
change directive and
speed up in trajectory?

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.692 align:middle line:10%
You've studied this?

00:35:42.692 --> 00:35:43.492 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:43.492 --> 00:35:43.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, you've read it?

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.950 align:middle line:10%
So it's out there.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.830 align:middle line:10%
So that was a milestone.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.025 align:middle line:10%
So, like I said, the Pleiades,
this nearby star cluster,

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:54.010 align:middle line:10%
is hosting a highly
advanced life.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:10%
They're going back
to this, like I said.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:10%
This cluster, I believe,
that the men and women

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.540 align:middle line:10%
are coming from is located
in the system of Taurus.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.230 align:middle line:10%
It's about 440 light
years from here.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:07.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a series of
hot blue stars that

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.240 align:middle line:10%
are approximately 100
million years old.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
they measure that.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Gosh.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.410 align:middle line:84%
How would you measure something
100 million years old?

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.785 align:middle line:84%
I guess it's all done by heat,
and light, and everything.

00:36:18.785 --> 00:36:20.960 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, that's what
we're contending here,

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is that these men
and women, I think,

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:28.008 align:middle line:84%
are coming out of this system,
and they're a part of us.

00:36:28.008 --> 00:36:30.470 align:middle line:84%
This woman that I've been
telling you about-- let's see

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.360 align:middle line:90%
what the next one is here.

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to this first.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:84%
What are we going to about
the extraterrestrials?

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.040 align:middle line:10%
There was never a
time when visitors,

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.240 align:middle line:10%
such as the spiritual
hierarchy, the angelics,

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.640 align:middle line:10%
and the extraterrestrial
support systems were not here.

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.460 align:middle line:10%
They've always been
here, watching over

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.730 align:middle line:10%
the karmic bound souls who
incarnate, fulfill their soul

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:10%
contracts, and then
return to source.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:10%
The Pleiadians have largely
been responsible for humankind.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:10%
Television and motion pictures
just get you used to the idea.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:10%
And we keep seeing this.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:04.400 align:middle line:10%
You notice all these TV
shows, all these movies

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.170 align:middle line:10%
keep massaging you
because as we're

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.320 align:middle line:10%
growing older and
getting used to it,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.573 align:middle line:10%
it seems almost natural to us.

00:37:11.573 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are young
kids that say,

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.070 align:middle line:84%
of course there's
extraterrestrials.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:20.000 align:middle line:10%
Seems like an awful waste
of space looking out there.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.870 align:middle line:10%
You know that scene in
the movie "Contact?"

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:10%
I love that.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:10%
You think there's
anything out there?

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And Jodie Foster, who
plays Ellie Arroway,

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.930 align:middle line:84%
says, it sure seems like
an awful waste to space.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
filled with beings.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's filled
with lifeforms all over.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.700 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to be naive not
to think that, you know?

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.120 align:middle line:90%
So we're a little farther along.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about this.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.130 align:middle line:84%
So how did I get some
of this information?

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, my source is, as
I said, a Russian woman,

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and she is from the Ukraine.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I meet with her every
other week, somewhat.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I sit down and I talk with her,
and she has an interpreter,

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and I've discussed it with her.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And I said, tell
me what you know.

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.880 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't
say an awful lot.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's one of those
kind of conversations where I'll

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.780 align:middle line:84%
say what the theory is,
and she'll say yes or no,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.270 align:middle line:90%
and then just giggle.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.875 align:middle line:84%
So it's for me to
almost find out.

00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not like
she's going to say,

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.870 align:middle line:84%
let me tell you
how this all works.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I have to find it myself.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.170 align:middle line:84%
The nature of our relationship
is I have to find it myself.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll write
down some questions,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
then I'll take it to
her and say, is this

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:90%
maybe the way that it works?

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, this woman
had met these two--

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.740 align:middle line:84%
a woman and a man like you
and I, who appeared in a room

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.700 align:middle line:84%
one day and had taken
her out of the house,

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and had taken her to a paradigm
that looks just like this.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's a little
nicer than this.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Trees, sky, blue
sky, clouds, ocean.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Everything that we have.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Very, very beautiful
paradigm, where

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:05.050 align:middle line:84%
she saw that men and women were
there, and those men and women

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.240 align:middle line:84%
are sort of in that
graduated state

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.870 align:middle line:84%
where we will be there
where they are once we've

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.150 align:middle line:84%
mastered certain
lessons, you know,

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.737 align:middle line:90%
in our own soul's contract.

00:39:15.737 --> 00:39:18.070 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you wouldn't
be able to necessarily live

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:84%
in that paradigm
with all the dross

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.320 align:middle line:90%
that you have in this world.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't necessarily
carry all the anger,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and the hatred, and resentment,
and the inability to let

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.270 align:middle line:84%
go of anger, and
fear, and resentment.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.580 align:middle line:84%
You would have to literally
vibrate differently

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.620 align:middle line:90%
to live in a paradigm there.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:84%
souls who eventually
become like yogis,

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:38.290 align:middle line:84%
eventually become
beyond yogi, step up

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and don't necessarily
even reincarnate

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
even in the physical world
here in Earth as we know it.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So she came back,
she was brought back,

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and she was given a very
extraordinary ability.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.010 align:middle line:90%


00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.170 align:middle line:84%
She has a little
office in Cupertino.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.620 align:middle line:84%
She has people that are lined
up to see her daily and weekly.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:84%
And she does almost
like a Reiki over you.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.930 align:middle line:84%
She kind of goes with
her hands over you.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.678 align:middle line:84%
And she'll so look at
your-- like, something

00:40:06.678 --> 00:40:08.470 align:middle line:84%
over near your neck or
something like that,

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.860 align:middle line:84%
and she'll go like this and
sort of pull it off and say,

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.510 align:middle line:90%
you don't need that.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, or you might walk
in after a very tough night.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you've had
a very tough night.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.190 align:middle line:84%
I know there's some
people out there

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:23.290 align:middle line:90%
that like to drink alcohol.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.880 align:middle line:90%
What a thought.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Take drugs.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And you come in and she
goes, what happened?

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.120 align:middle line:90%
Your whole field is like this.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.920 align:middle line:90%
It's not right.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I've come in
when I've not felt well,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and she goes around
my body like that,

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and then she'll say
come back in 40 minutes.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Second appointment
is 40 minutes later.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.600 align:middle line:84%
About 30 minutes after
that second appointment,

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.620 align:middle line:84%
I'll walk home or I'll
drive home and I'll go, wow.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I feel fantastic.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:55.540 align:middle line:90%
Very present.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Digestive seems to
be working good.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.500 align:middle line:90%
I feel very present, relaxed.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.360 align:middle line:84%
When we're toxic with the food
and all the trouble out there--

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
trauma, abuse,
addictions, toxic food--

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.077 align:middle line:90%
we become very, uh.

00:41:10.077 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:90%
You know what I'm talking about.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:13.960 align:middle line:90%
Your thoughts get bad.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel well.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe let's
say you get good rest

00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and you eat well or
something like that,

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.850 align:middle line:90%
and you go, there I am again.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.350 align:middle line:90%
That's a daily practice.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.300 align:middle line:84%
She sort of helps
the light body.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So her son is responsible
for these writings.

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:36.610 align:middle line:10%
Her son is writing both of
these styles, and he hears them.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.560 align:middle line:10%
And he writes the writing in
a trance with his left hand,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.100 align:middle line:10%
although he's right handed.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:10%
He writes it with his left
hand, and he writes it

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:49.630 align:middle line:10%
from right to left, and
he writes it, actually,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.160 align:middle line:10%
in reverse.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.380 align:middle line:10%
What I did with these was--

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.630 align:middle line:10%
this is already reversed.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.120 align:middle line:10%
Actually, when you take the--

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:10%
they're up in my room.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll have to see me,
like, at panel on Sunday,

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and you can get a copy.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Or if you run into me
in the hallway somehow.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.580 align:middle line:84%
When he writes it,
you would hold it up

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.900 align:middle line:90%
and see that it's reversed.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned it over
and held it up to the light,

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I all of a sudden
could see, oh, there's

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.270 align:middle line:84%
J. There's a T. You can
see that there's actually

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:23.740 align:middle line:84%
some references to our
own alphabet almost.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:90%
You can see a cursiveness.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.265 align:middle line:90%
You see the dots over this.

00:42:27.265 --> 00:42:28.390 align:middle line:10%
You want to pan it on that?

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:29.440 align:middle line:10%
You can see that.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.910 align:middle line:10%
What we're seeing here is
kind of a singsong language.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.200 align:middle line:10%
And he says that he
only is a witness to it.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.160 align:middle line:10%
He has no control.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.600 align:middle line:10%
He does not know what
these messages say.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully it's not, we're
going to be late for dinner,

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:90%
and we're dinner.

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But I've already
reversed this for you.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So the originals are where
it's just literally reversed.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.860 align:middle line:84%
Then in another meeting, he
writes-- this is the same guy,

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.430 align:middle line:90%
writing another language.

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And what they do
know is that these

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:06.610 align:middle line:84%
are two languages that they feel
are coming from this cluster.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.045 align:middle line:90%
What they say, they don't know.

00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're not
ready for that.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's just designed
just to entertain us,

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.480 align:middle line:84%
to see that somebody
is moving in on us,

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.480 align:middle line:84%
or somebody has something
to impart to us.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
So that's where some of
my information is coming.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why she's
telling me, look, don't

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:28.473 align:middle line:84%
be so sidetracked with all
these little gray things.

00:43:28.473 --> 00:43:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that are
sensational because they

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.990 align:middle line:84%
don't look like us, and
movies sensationalize them.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Know that men and
women are here.

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of them can materialize
and dematerialize.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.410 align:middle line:90%
I know that sounds incredible.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:45.350 align:middle line:84%
I hope nobody sends me
hate mail after this.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.520 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.910 align:middle line:90%
So this is the Pleiades.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.510 align:middle line:90%
You have these other systems.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:56.450 align:middle line:10%
The Orion systems next to it
are ancient celestial neighbors.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:44:00.033 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things that people
can do when they make contact--

00:44:00.033 --> 00:44:01.700 align:middle line:10%
many people make
contact, and they do it

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.620 align:middle line:10%
while their body is asleep.

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:06.830 align:middle line:10%
That's the best way to teach you
because you're not necessarily

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:08.970 align:middle line:10%
reacting.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.110 align:middle line:10%
And so if you think about it,
one third of our entire life

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:17.500 align:middle line:10%
is spent prone, asleep
with the body relaxed.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.060 align:middle line:10%
That's a lot of time.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:10%
One third.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.280 align:middle line:10%
If you lived in '92, think
about how much time that is.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Millions of hours are
spent in a prone position

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:30.378 align:middle line:90%
where you don't even know--

00:44:30.378 --> 00:44:32.670 align:middle line:84%
you don't wake up necessarily
in your dream going, hey,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.500 align:middle line:90%
what happened to my body?

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.340 align:middle line:84%
No, you literally see
things as a witness,

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.830 align:middle line:84%
and you take it into your
subconscious, et cetera.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.420 align:middle line:90%
And you're working things out.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You have the experiences
of boundlessness.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You have the
conscious mind, which

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.180 align:middle line:84%
manages your daily life, working
and processing lessons daily.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You have the pre-conscious mind.

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:56.550 align:middle line:84%
You have memories that can be
accessed with little effort.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.360 align:middle line:84%
You'll access those memories,
but maybe not necessarily

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:84%
pull them back consciously
when you wake up.

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.650 align:middle line:10%
The subconscious mind contains
our entire life and history,

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.470 align:middle line:10%
including repressed memories.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.840 align:middle line:10%
The subconscious
is the repository

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.260 align:middle line:10%
of all of our thoughts, all of
our deeds, all of our actions.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.710 align:middle line:10%
And they read those
pools at nighttime.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.050 align:middle line:10%
They read those pools
of thought to see,

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:middle line:10%
how is this soul developing?

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:10%
What's happening with
this particular soul?

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.160 align:middle line:10%
They have the
collective unconscious--

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.050 align:middle line:10%
that's all of us
together-- which

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:32.200 align:middle line:10%
has the hidden repository
of ideas, symbols,

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.170 align:middle line:10%
archetypes that deal
with the major issues

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.790 align:middle line:10%
of the human condition.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So they see us as
individuals, and then they

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:44.590 align:middle line:84%
read our progress of how
we're doing as a soul,

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:49.030 align:middle line:84%
and then they see the
repository of ideas of thought,

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:90%
et cetera, as a collective.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.250 align:middle line:90%
How are we doing as a species?

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They have a vested
interest in this.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:57.400 align:middle line:90%
I truly believe that.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I think they're very
vested in our experience.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:03.370 align:middle line:90%
This is the human sleep cycle.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:07.240 align:middle line:84%
This happens one third
of your life every night.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:09.760 align:middle line:10%
Right now, if I'm not
boring you to tears,

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.070 align:middle line:10%
you're in beta, at the top.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:84%
You hear my voice, you see
us together, et cetera.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.750 align:middle line:84%
You go have dinner,
you see the expo.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.150 align:middle line:90%
You're in beta.

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:19.960 align:middle line:84%
You see the material
world, right?

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's this interesting
window right there,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.680 align:middle line:84%
the hypnagogic, that little
tiny next group in here--

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.480 align:middle line:90%
Can I turn this?

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:28.563 align:middle line:90%
Can I move this over here?

00:46:28.563 --> 00:46:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.260 align:middle line:90%
That little-- thank you.

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.060 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:36.460 align:middle line:90%
This little window here--

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that's called the
hypnagogic window.

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:40.540 align:middle line:10%
That's that little window
when you know you're

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.160 align:middle line:10%
falling asleep from beta.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.560 align:middle line:84%
When you're just sort of
nodding off and you go, oh.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And you feel yourself
falling into it.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Some people stay in that
window for a little while,

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and you hear or
witness something.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Third eye, and your
ajuna center opens up,

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.930 align:middle line:90%
you might witness visitors.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:84%
You might witness your
mother, who has passed away,

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.810 align:middle line:84%
who has another thought
to impart to you.

00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Many people in
near-death experiences

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.260 align:middle line:84%
go through hypnagogic
and stay there.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.040 align:middle line:90%
The body is, you know--

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.840 align:middle line:90%
the alpha waves.

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.107 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes down.

00:47:15.107 --> 00:47:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And they stay in the
hypnagogic state,

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and they witness kind
of what's going--

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.760 align:middle line:84%
what if I told you that if
your body was relaxed enough,

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.718 align:middle line:84%
you'd see there's a whole
bunch of more people,

00:47:23.718 --> 00:47:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and actually some of those
seats are also filled?

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was doing better
than I thought.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we all were.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So and then you fall deeply
into alpha, and then you go--

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and most people, when they
go from beta-- when you first

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:40.960 align:middle line:84%
fall asleep, you go into
hypnagogic, you witness things,

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.490 align:middle line:90%
and you fall deep into delta.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.000 align:middle line:84%
This delta area here, this
is called the well of dreams.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.550 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of your
deep dreaming is going.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And you will witness
people, or things,

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.160 align:middle line:90%
or places, and process things.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.330 align:middle line:10%
And then throughout the
night, you can see here,

00:47:56.330 --> 00:47:59.290 align:middle line:10%
as you get up to 1 o'clock
in the morning, 2:30,

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.180 align:middle line:10%
4 o'clock, et cetera,
you actually--

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.280 align:middle line:10%
the REMs and all that in
your sleep is-- you're

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.290 align:middle line:10%
sort of rising back
up until you actually

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.230 align:middle line:10%
pass through the
hypnagogic window again.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And here in the morning,
you will maybe just--

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:13.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe you don't
even open your eyes.

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You can just see that
there are people here that

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:90%
are there standing in the room.

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:19.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
important-- the yogis

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.050 align:middle line:84%
are able to get to and stay
in that state of hypnagogic.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.100 align:middle line:84%
They can get so
relaxed with their body

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.870 align:middle line:84%
that they're actually
in tune with that.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:26.912 align:middle line:90%
How are we doing on time?

00:48:26.912 --> 00:48:32.110 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:32.910 align:middle line:90%
What's that?

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Points in time.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:84%
The historical significance of
the present moment on planet

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.420 align:middle line:90%
Earth right now is massive.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:49.470 align:middle line:10%
The collapse of many systems,
the collision of ideologies,

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.350 align:middle line:10%
the acclamation of wealth
and power by the very few

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:10%
individuals is unsustainable--

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.340 align:middle line:10%
as unstable in the
financial markets.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.022 align:middle line:10%
You'll notice that we are--

00:49:01.022 --> 00:49:03.480 align:middle line:10%
I hate to break the bad news,
but you know as well as I do,

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.610 align:middle line:10%
we are in the collapse
of the system.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:09.300 align:middle line:10%
The wealthy elite
by the few families

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:13.650 align:middle line:10%
leaving the great majority
of the planet as worker bees,

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:17.040 align:middle line:10%
while they direct
their interest.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.550 align:middle line:10%
The significance of an emerging
intelligence self discovering

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.610 align:middle line:10%
itself within a competitive
galactic community

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:25.890 align:middle line:10%
is actually happening
right now, too.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.320 align:middle line:10%
This emerging
intelligence is happening

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.140 align:middle line:10%
because I think we are
being sort of birthed

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:33.820 align:middle line:10%
into this ascension.

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:39.330 align:middle line:84%
How many people here get an
idea, and it's so fantastic,

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.880 align:middle line:90%
and you think to yourself, wow.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And two minutes later,
you go, what was that?

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can't even
hang on to it.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.520 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that is the
repository of the processes

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in your own thought's
consciousness.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of that is
them talking to you,

00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:58.050 align:middle line:84%
giving you concepts and ideas,
pushing you and moving you

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.040 align:middle line:90%
forward.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.080 align:middle line:10%
Many souls, human
and alien alike,

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.870 align:middle line:10%
have been born at this
time to help Earth evolve

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.330 align:middle line:10%
into a more mature expression.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:12.100 align:middle line:10%
So that's why, via the internet,
we have all these things now.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:17.880 align:middle line:10%
We have wonderful accessibility
to new thought processes.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.120 align:middle line:84%
We can literally open
up our flip phone or--

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:20.920 align:middle line:90%
flip phone.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Smartphone.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Some of us still
have a flip phone.

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.980 align:middle line:84%
I open up my smartphone,
and there we are,

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.360 align:middle line:90%
and you have this presentation.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.160 align:middle line:90%
There is one here!

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, sir.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.270 align:middle line:90%
Right on.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:37.650 align:middle line:84%
There's a hold out from the
past is a blast, right there.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Flip phones-- you know, I always
wanted to take a picture of me

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.670 align:middle line:84%
on a dial up phone reading
a newspaper with the phone

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.940 align:middle line:84%
in between my ear
like that, right?

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And reading the
newspaper and everything.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And then put it on
Facebook and say,

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:55.380 align:middle line:90%
this is the way the world was.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember a time
when you weren't

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:84%
home and somebody called you,
you just missed the call.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.400 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Now you jump.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Ding!

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:05.850 align:middle line:90%
Somebody texted me.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Is it the IRS?

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.330 align:middle line:84%
You pull up to a stoplight,
and there's always

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.785 align:middle line:84%
some guy that's standing
there like this,

00:51:14.785 --> 00:51:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and he's waiting for
the light to turn.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:17.910 align:middle line:84%
How many of you had
this experience?

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.250 align:middle line:90%
You look over, and there he is.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, his face is
all lit up a little bit.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at his
cell phone like this.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.628 align:middle line:84%
He's waiting for the
light to turn green.

00:51:25.628 --> 00:51:27.720 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at that
cell phone and you say,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:90%
she doesn't love you.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.120 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Put your phone down.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.000 align:middle line:84%
How many of you have
had that experience?

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Or you see the car
going like this

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:39.870 align:middle line:84%
because you know this person's
looking at their cell phone.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:40.830 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.420 align:middle line:90%
We're so addicted.

00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:45.990 align:middle line:90%
So anyway, but Earth is--

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.220 align:middle line:84%
really, Earth is evolving
into a more mature expression.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.410 align:middle line:90%
The ascension of planet Earth.

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Before we get to the
UFO photos, let's

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.370 align:middle line:84%
talk about the ascension
of planet Earth.

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:59.010 align:middle line:10%
This is a period of
extraordinary acceleration

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:03.570 align:middle line:10%
of energy marked by a vast
technological and rapid changes

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:10%
to human consciousness.

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:09.420 align:middle line:10%
All humanity is given a powerful
choice during this time.

00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:12.120 align:middle line:10%
We are being asked to be the
wayshowers, the transition

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:15.820 align:middle line:10%
team, the ones who
make the difference.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.210 align:middle line:10%
The first phase of
this alignment--

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:20.340 align:middle line:10%
if we look at the
harmonic convergence,

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.190 align:middle line:10%
if you follow
astrology, if you follow

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:28.020 align:middle line:10%
a progression of the
esoteric sciences talking

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.250 align:middle line:10%
about the harmonic
convergence, this

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.230 align:middle line:10%
placed us right
in this alignment

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:41.310 align:middle line:10%
around 1987 to 1996, which began
a fantastic increase in energy,

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:44.050 align:middle line:10%
thrusting us deep into
the information age.

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.590 align:middle line:10%
We see the internet,
you know, coming here.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.330 align:middle line:10%
Just being thought
of at this point.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.730 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, the entire
globe was aligned

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:53.250 align:middle line:10%
in communication with
itself as never before,

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:10%
with our connection to a
vast array of knowledge

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.620 align:middle line:10%
via the internet.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.090 align:middle line:10%
A lot of us have
lived long enough

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.700 align:middle line:10%
to see the internet
come of age, where

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:09.310 align:middle line:10%
we are availed to lightning
fast information versus going

00:53:09.310 --> 00:53:10.110 align:middle line:10%
to the library.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:13.033 align:middle line:84%
Driving down there, finding
a parking spot, going in.

00:53:13.033 --> 00:53:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you have this book?

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.820 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't have that book.

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Getting back in
your car, driving.

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:19.020 align:middle line:90%
You know the rest of the story.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.610 align:middle line:90%
We were crawling.

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now with this advent
of the phone like this,

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.810 align:middle line:90%
our knowledge is speeding up.

00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:31.050 align:middle line:84%
The acceleration of information
created new technologies,

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:33.360 align:middle line:84%
conscious modalities,
and transformed

00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:90%
the landscape of human thought.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:41.560 align:middle line:84%
So we are sort of being
thrust into this new period.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a second phase here.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:48.085 align:middle line:84%
I follow a number of people like
Barbara Marciniak, Barbara Hand

00:53:48.085 --> 00:53:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Clow, others.

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.060 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The list is endless of people
that I think have stated

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.240 align:middle line:90%
a very similar model to this.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.020 align:middle line:10%
If our Pleiadian
friends are here,

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:04.440 align:middle line:10%
they are describing the second
phase between 1997 and 2007,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.190 align:middle line:10%
remarked by major advances in
consciousness and technology.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:11.190 align:middle line:10%
We've seen that almost
everything we've ever

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:10%
learned about life and human
consciousness has doubled,

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.920 align:middle line:10%
tripled even since
the year 1997.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.730 align:middle line:10%
We're availed to so
much more information

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.180 align:middle line:10%
about what our experience is
about, and have that available.

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:29.250 align:middle line:10%
During this phase of science in
near-death experience studies,

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:33.150 align:middle line:10%
they observed that consciousness
is existing independently

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:37.250 align:middle line:10%
of brain function
for the first time.

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:38.730 align:middle line:10%
There's a guy--

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.850 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be doing
introductions this weekend.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:46.080 align:middle line:84%
They have me pseudo staff, as
well as doing workshops, right?

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.010 align:middle line:90%
But there's a guy--

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:47.950 align:middle line:90%
I'll get it later on.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:48.690 align:middle line:90%
It's in the program.

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy that's
really good at this--

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I read his biography only
a couple of nights ago--

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:55.410 align:middle line:90%
who has studied this.

00:54:55.410 --> 00:55:01.090 align:middle line:84%
That human thought is
actually independent.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually happening
completely in the brain.

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It's actually happening
in the spirit.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:07.638 align:middle line:90%
And his work is about that.

00:55:07.638 --> 00:55:09.930 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more and more
that most of your thoughts

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.690 align:middle line:84%
are going on up
here, and then they

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:14.820 align:middle line:84%
translate into what
you think is the brain

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.708 align:middle line:84%
and what you think is
your thought process.

00:55:17.708 --> 00:55:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And you think it's
happening in your brain,

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.480 align:middle line:84%
but actually it's
in your spirit.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.780 align:middle line:84%
The spirit is really responsible
for the consciousness,

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, the
nervous system, the body

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:30.863 align:middle line:84%
is a vehicle just
by which we borrow.

00:55:30.863 --> 00:55:33.030 align:middle line:84%
We're birthed into this
experience and we borrow it,

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and we have an interim time
where we can use this body.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.600 align:middle line:10%
Unprecedented global
communications and interactions

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.740 align:middle line:10%
led to novel advances in
awareness and understanding

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.250 align:middle line:10%
of the human condition
as never before.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:54.830 align:middle line:10%
So you-- well, I know
that something is up.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.330 align:middle line:10%
We're being called
into, like, this.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.260 align:middle line:10%
The ready room.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.190 align:middle line:10%
This could be like
the ready room, right?

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:03.320 align:middle line:10%
We're getting the idea
that our visitors are here,

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:05.300 align:middle line:10%
and then we're being
sort of moved forward

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:07.010 align:middle line:10%
with that knowledge,
and eventually we'll

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:09.110 align:middle line:10%
share that knowledge
with other people.

00:56:09.110 --> 00:56:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Like any other culture,
it steps up in wisdom

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.010 align:middle line:10%
and imparts that wisdom
to the next tribe.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It goes on and on and on.

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.720 align:middle line:90%
It's always been that way.

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:24.770 align:middle line:10%
This third phase from
2007 to 2010 and beyond

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:26.780 align:middle line:10%
brings us through
humanity's progression

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.000 align:middle line:10%
into a new period
of enlightenment.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.130 align:middle line:84%
This time will often
be unpredictable,

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and conflicts will
arise as humanity

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.510 align:middle line:84%
will be forced to make
quick decisions to ensure

00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:41.610 align:middle line:90%
safe passage into the future.

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.450 align:middle line:84%
This is why I have said
that our visitors are

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:47.600 align:middle line:84%
watching the karmic bound
souls, watching us as a species,

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.940 align:middle line:84%
watching us as a
progressive, and they don't

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:53.040 align:middle line:90%
want to lose this experience.

00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big believer
that if we launched

00:56:54.980 --> 00:57:03.470 align:middle line:84%
into a nuclear conflict, that
could be the day of disclosure.

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.370 align:middle line:90%
Already, we've had nuclear--

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:06.860 align:middle line:90%
nodding your head.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There's been talk of
nuclear releasing,

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.740 align:middle line:84%
where suddenly it
was interrupted

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanism
simply didn't work.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe that the
spiritual hierarchies don't

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.570 align:middle line:90%
want to lose this experience.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.760 align:middle line:84%
They're watching
this very carefully.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.980 align:middle line:10%
This final period
also brings earth

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.520 align:middle line:10%
into an alignment with the solar
galactic center at the winter

00:57:28.520 --> 00:57:32.630 align:middle line:10%
solstice of 2012, which is
now quite a while ago, which

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.540 align:middle line:10%
represents the beginning
and completion of what's

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.730 align:middle line:10%
called a 24,000 year cycle.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:41.180 align:middle line:10%
That 24,000 year cycle that
we shared for a long time--

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.000 align:middle line:10%
remember we were always saying,
when the harmonic convergence

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.330 align:middle line:10%
reaches 2012, you're
going to look up

00:57:46.330 --> 00:57:48.290 align:middle line:10%
and the whole sky's
going to be filled,

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.340 align:middle line:10%
and then you're going to pay.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see I was right.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And nothing happened.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Except for we just got ushered
into the next expression.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:07.710 align:middle line:84%
This next expression of
getting used to the idea

00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that there are beings
all around here.

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:16.852 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

00:58:16.852 --> 00:58:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I want to watch this
carefully with time,

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.102 align:middle line:84%
and I want to respect
your time, too.

00:58:20.102 --> 00:58:22.410 align:middle line:90%


00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.830 align:middle line:90%
We've got a little time left.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:28.710 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you and
interrupt this really

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:32.370 align:middle line:84%
carefully about a story that
many people asked me to tell.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:38.568 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'll include
it in the presentation.

00:58:38.568 --> 00:58:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It's normally not
in my presentation,

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.750 align:middle line:90%
but I will tell you this story.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.590 align:middle line:90%
It's a true story.

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:46.530 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I've said
that you're surrounded

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.400 align:middle line:90%
by all these beings, right?

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.990 align:middle line:84%
You're surrounded by
all kinds of things.

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:52.580 align:middle line:90%
All of the above is true.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Angelics, fairies,
ultraterrestrials, discarnates,

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:00.390 align:middle line:90%
mom and dad.

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:03.720 align:middle line:84%
All of this doesn't
necessarily leave this plane

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.090 align:middle line:90%
when this experience is over.

00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just moving into another
phase just out of the line

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:13.620 align:middle line:90%
sight of your eyesight.

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:18.143 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, I went and
saw the movie "Contact"

00:59:18.143 --> 00:59:19.060 align:middle line:90%
with a friend of mine.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, people know me-- that
I do a lot of relief work.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've helped elderly,
I feed the homeless.

00:59:24.780 --> 00:59:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I'm duty bound
with what I've been given,

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:33.520 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't make me have to
work so hard and I can serve.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It's important to serve.

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:35.320 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Service is a very big thing
for me in every which way.

00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether I feed the
homeless and you see me

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:44.400 align:middle line:84%
in the street with that, or I'm
in some sort of other support

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.890 align:middle line:90%
services, counseling services.

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a large background
in behavioral science.

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:51.252 align:middle line:90%
So I'm in behavioral studies.

00:59:51.252 --> 00:59:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm always curious
about why people

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.570 align:middle line:90%
believe what they believe.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:59.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, I took this older
man, who had a lot of trauma--

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.250 align:middle line:90%
oh, poor Henry.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.973 align:middle line:90%
Just riddled with trauma.

01:00:02.973 --> 01:00:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you know,
I would take him out.

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:06.057 align:middle line:90%
I would take him to parties.

01:00:06.057 --> 01:00:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And people would say, why
do you bring this guy?

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.830 align:middle line:90%
You know, he's acting out.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:11.812 align:middle line:90%
It's embarrassing.

01:00:11.812 --> 01:00:13.770 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if I didn't
bring him to a party,

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.310 align:middle line:90%
nobody else would.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:17.158 align:middle line:84%
So he's my friend,
I'm bringing him.

01:00:17.158 --> 01:00:18.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it is, you know?

01:00:18.450 --> 01:00:22.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to serve people that
are less fortunate than you.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.670 align:middle line:90%
Handicapped people.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:24.990 align:middle line:90%
I run into tough cases.

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I took him to see
the movie "Contact."

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We went and saw the movie
"Contact" and we came back.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.528 align:middle line:90%
And we were so excited.

01:00:31.528 --> 01:00:32.778 align:middle line:90%
We were like a couple of kids.

01:00:32.778 --> 01:00:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It was midnight.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.910 align:middle line:90%
This is 1997.

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's the kitchen
counter here, and here's me,

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.240 align:middle line:90%
and here's Henry.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:47.850 align:middle line:90%
And Henry was in World War II.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.110 align:middle line:90%
He never saw the war.

01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:53.610 align:middle line:10%
He was captured as a
Dutch foreign national

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:59.010 align:middle line:10%
in Shanghai when the Japanese
were taking over Shanghai.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.420 align:middle line:90%
So he never even saw the war.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
He got taken literally
three weeks after--

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:04.690 align:middle line:90%
he'd been in the army.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the Dutch
army, and he got rounded up,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and he never got to see the war.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:10.440 align:middle line:90%
He was captured.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.380 align:middle line:90%
Taken to a Japanese prison camp.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
What does this have
to do with anything?

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.450 align:middle line:90%
He's here.

01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:17.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.460 align:middle line:90%
It's 1997.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's my kitchen counter.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.930 align:middle line:90%
Here's my refrigerator.

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we were talking--
wasn't that a great film?

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Wasn't that a great film?

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.180 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic, man.

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.555 align:middle line:84%
Just loved that
scene, and so on.

01:01:27.555 --> 01:01:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're just talking
and everything.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.723 align:middle line:84%
And as we were talking
and everything,

01:01:30.723 --> 01:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
we both kind of
looked down, and there

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
was what looked like
a little tiny lady

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:43.810 align:middle line:84%
with what looked
like dragonfly wings.

01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And you know how the dragonfly
wings are, like, kind of clear?

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.242 align:middle line:84%
They have the big wing
on top and they have

01:01:48.242 --> 01:01:50.170 align:middle line:90%
a little stabilizer underneath?

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And there was a little tiny lady
about that tall with dragonfly

01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:57.360 align:middle line:90%
wings.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And I looked down,
and it went like this,

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and it realized we
were looking at her

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.230 align:middle line:90%
and it was looking at us.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, when something like that
happens, it stops your heart.

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that
it stopped our heart.

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:17.685 align:middle line:90%
I literally was frozen.

01:02:17.685 --> 01:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen anything
like that in my life.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden-- we
both were looking at it.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.925 align:middle line:84%
And we were just like,
it's looking at us.

01:02:25.925 --> 01:02:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, it turned to

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
a brilliant, beautiful
cobalt blue, aqua light,

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and just went [WOOSH] and went
right in between our fa-- right

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
in between us and flew straight
into the refrigerator door

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.610 align:middle line:90%
and disappeared.

01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was just frozen.

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was writing "Divine
Blueprint," my first book,

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.830 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
That's how old that book is.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I was starting to
come out of it, I said--

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to say what I saw.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to see if
he saw what I saw.

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Because I know what I saw.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Henry,
what did you see?

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't think
of the word in English.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So he said it was like a little
Tinker Bell or something.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the name of the fairy
in "Peter Pan," is it not?

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And I started--
literally, honest to god,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I started to jump up and
down like on a pogo stick.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.020 align:middle line:90%
I was just jumping up and down.

01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:26.820 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Wow!

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing my first book.

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.140 align:middle line:84%
We have touched
the astral plane.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
We have confirmation
that there's fairies.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:36.530 align:middle line:90%
There's literally fairies.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:37.330 align:middle line:90%
That they're real.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.270 align:middle line:90%
My god.

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.070 align:middle line:90%
My god.

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:40.330 align:middle line:90%
Jumping up and down.

01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:42.430 align:middle line:90%
And he's like this.

01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And tears just started
to roll down his face.

01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And he just covered his face.

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Henry, what's
the matter with you?

01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:52.110 align:middle line:90%
This is a confirmation.

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Fairies!

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine that?

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Fairies exist!

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:59.295 align:middle line:84%
We have touched
the astral plane.

01:03:59.295 --> 01:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
the matter with you?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Why are you crying?

01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
He says, in 1943, I was
head of the death ward.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.665 align:middle line:90%
I buried all my friends.

01:04:09.665 --> 01:04:12.340 align:middle line:90%


01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.780 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.910 align:middle line:84%
What does this have
to do about the fairy?

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
What does this have
to do with that?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, in 1943, the
Japanese had us building

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:26.830 align:middle line:90%
runways for Tojo's Air Force.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And we would go out and
cut hay and barley wheat

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
for food, or for whatever,
or for clearing runways

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.280 align:middle line:84%
so the Zeros, the fighter
planes, the famed Japanese Zero

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.980 align:middle line:84%
pilots, would be able to
land in these remote areas

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.220 align:middle line:90%
of the jungle.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's nice.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.280 align:middle line:84%
What does this have
to do with that?

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
He said, I would
see exactly that.

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And most of my friends
were all starving to death.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.700 align:middle line:90%
We all weighed only 80 pounds.

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would see that, and it
would fly in the distance,

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
and it would land
in the distance.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And I would look around
for the Japanese soldiers,

01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and then I would make my
way over to where it landed,

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
and there were the mushrooms.

01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would look around, and
then I would eat the mushrooms

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.150 align:middle line:90%
for the protein.

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, he said,
I made a sack, a little pocket

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.050 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And when another fairy,
the next couple of days,

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:29.307 align:middle line:84%
would appear to me, another
one would fly over there,

01:05:29.307 --> 01:05:31.390 align:middle line:84%
and I go over there, and
there were the mushrooms.

01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.272 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I'd
put them in here.

01:05:33.272 --> 01:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
If you got caught
stealing food, it

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
was a great way to lose your
hands, or the death penalty,

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:40.940 align:middle line:90%
or be beaten somehow.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I would take the
mushrooms back to my bunk,

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and I would cover
myself with a blanket,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and I'd pull the mushrooms
out and I would eat mushrooms.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I lived when
everybody else died.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said, one day
after the fairies

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
supporting me for
2 and 1/2 years,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.210 align:middle line:90%
on and off at various times--

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
one day we woke up and it
sounded like the whole sky

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
was opening up.

01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The biggest thunder, he said,
he ever heard in his life.

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed on the door and
the door to the barrack opened,

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.450 align:middle line:90%
and there was no one there.

01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
There was no soldiers, anybody.

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
They had fled.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And they looked up,
and they realized

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
the planes were coming over
and the parachutes were

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.680 align:middle line:90%
beginning to open up.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And they realized that
it was liberation day

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.210 align:middle line:90%
and that they had made it.

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
He lived all the way
to liberation day

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.730 align:middle line:90%
because of the fairies.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And he thanked the
fairies every day

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
because the fairies
saved his life.

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I haven't
seen them for a long time.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
But that, my friend,
that little fairy,

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.080 align:middle line:84%
that's why I'm living and
standing in your kitchen.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%
Really remarkable, isn't it?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.780 align:middle line:90%
It's a really remarkable thing.

01:06:57.780 --> 01:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
So moving along really quickly.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would
share that with you.

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.960 align:middle line:10%
Let's go back to our
presentation here.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.910 align:middle line:10%
We are actually in the
collapse of our civilization.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:12.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.490 align:middle line:10%
It's the way it is.

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:15.860 align:middle line:10%
You might ask yourself, why
is all this chaos happening?

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.180 align:middle line:10%
Where is the moral
integrity, the reliability,

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.283 align:middle line:10%
the compensation,
the compassion?

01:07:20.283 --> 01:07:21.950 align:middle line:10%
Your mastery in life's
lessons are being

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.680 align:middle line:10%
tested to the highest degree.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.930 align:middle line:10%
You're being called to
step into your mastery

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:29.810 align:middle line:10%
and become the
wayshowers of a new, more

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:32.810 align:middle line:10%
conscious civilization.

01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:35.510 align:middle line:10%
This geogalactic
convergence that's happened

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.640 align:middle line:10%
since 2012 and beyond.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.340 align:middle line:10%
The ancients have-- seers
of time keepers have

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.960 align:middle line:10%
had a profound
ability to understand

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.710 align:middle line:10%
the stellar aspect of life and
the planetary cycles contained

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:48.590 align:middle line:10%
within a large
scale cosmic plan.

01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:51.290 align:middle line:10%
Within this cosmic plan,
a harmonic synchronicity

01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:55.100 align:middle line:10%
seems to exist between human
consciousness and celestial

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.390 align:middle line:10%
rhythms that occur over
a long period of time.

01:07:59.390 --> 01:08:03.500 align:middle line:10%
2012 marked the beginning
of a geopolar solar galactic

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.220 align:middle line:10%
convergence that occurs
about every 24,000 years

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:11.690 align:middle line:10%
and its significance will likely
increase as more becomes known.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.940 align:middle line:10%
Many prophecies
from ancient legend

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:16.729 align:middle line:10%
describe this as a
time of great change,

01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:19.130 align:middle line:10%
such as in the
Pleiadians concept

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:22.550 align:middle line:10%
of the nanosecond, also
known as a geostellar

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:23.870 align:middle line:10%
harmonic convergence.

01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.405 align:middle line:10%
The nanosecond, as
I said-- remember

01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:27.020 align:middle line:10%
in the early part
of my presentation

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.100 align:middle line:10%
I said, they're living
in the perpetual moment?

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.100 align:middle line:10%
So time and evolution
is happening around.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.560 align:middle line:10%
We're having a day,
a month, a year.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.939 align:middle line:10%
We're growing older.

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:42.590 align:middle line:10%
And we see distance from
youth, to being young,

01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:45.680 align:middle line:10%
to enjoying the middle
part of our life

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.939 align:middle line:10%
and becoming older, and then
returning back to source.

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:53.120 align:middle line:10%
They watch over this
process each and every day.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.300 align:middle line:10%
And this harmonic
convergence is kind

01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:00.109 align:middle line:10%
of what the Bible even talks
about when it talks about--

01:09:00.109 --> 01:09:02.309 align:middle line:10%
they refer to it in many ways.

01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:03.109 align:middle line:90%
The rapture.

01:09:03.109 --> 01:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you
were growing up--

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
we used to see those when we
were growing up, you know?

01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:09.930 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, one
day, it's all going

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to change in the twinkling
of an eye in one second.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.319 align:middle line:84%
Jesus will be up in
the sky and everything,

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and people that have been good
will be lifted up to meet him.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And they showed you these
pictures of, like, cars

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:23.580 align:middle line:90%
driving off bridges and stuff.

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:23.779 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:09:23.779 --> 01:09:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Because there was
no driver in them.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.500 align:middle line:90%
They went up to meet the Lord.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.760 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I remember those when I was
looking through that kind

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.850 align:middle line:90%
of stuff growing up.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.680 align:middle line:90%
I was like, wow.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be more
out of divine order

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.979 align:middle line:84%
than a whole bunch of
cars off the freeway

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:40.939 align:middle line:90%
with no drivers in them.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:41.990 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:45.890 align:middle line:90%
That's not the way this happens.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
The way I think this happens
is they're meeting you.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to get
used to the idea.

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to talk
to them a little bit.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn to trust
this process a little bit.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If you're not meditating every
day and still in your mind

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and saying this is my space--

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't there used to
be an app like that?

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:09.673 align:middle line:90%


01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:12.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it me?

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.700 align:middle line:84%
This is my time, and that time
is when you give that time only

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
to yourself and
you want to speak

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:19.730 align:middle line:90%
with these representatives.

01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
You know why most people don't
meet representatives and meet

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.100 align:middle line:90%
these celestial beings?

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.115 align:middle line:84%
Because they never even
afford the time to it.

01:10:27.115 --> 01:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It'd be like,
well, if you're not

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.900 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the bar
mitzvah, you're not

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.775 align:middle line:84%
going to be at the bar
mitzvah, now, are you?

01:10:31.775 --> 01:10:34.280 align:middle line:90%


01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to go to this
sort of bar mitzvah or whatever.

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.720 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go to that space.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You've got to create
that ashram for yourself.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
You've got to create that sacred
space to say, this is my time.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I've gotten the word.

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:47.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm moving forward.

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm making a commitment.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to talk
to these beings.

01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:52.727 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing what I can in my part.

01:10:52.727 --> 01:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to have that conver--
you'll notice your dreams start

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to change and
become very real now

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because the Earth is being
lifted up in this frequency,

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
and people are describing
much different terms

01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:04.900 align:middle line:90%
in their dreams.

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.942 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to this thing
called The Well of Dreams

01:11:06.942 --> 01:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
real soon here in Santa Cruz.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:10.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a lady, wonderful
lady, that experiments in that

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.380 align:middle line:84%
and says, you notice how
your dreams are becoming

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.960 align:middle line:90%
like real life time happenings?

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed how
they've taken on almost

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.620 align:middle line:90%
a different dimension?

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%
It's very exciting time.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting time.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:21.875 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.100 align:middle line:90%
So UFOs?

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:25.380 align:middle line:90%
They are always here.

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
There's never been a time
when they're not here.

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
They fly through our
skies daily because they

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.650 align:middle line:90%
are watching this experience.

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And also, they're
watching sort of the grid

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.960 align:middle line:90%
lines of the planet.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
They're watching the balance
of how the planet sits

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:39.170 align:middle line:84%
in its position in concordance
with the declaration

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:42.800 align:middle line:84%
on the stars, the sun,
the moon, the balance

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.200 align:middle line:90%
of the planet itself.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And as I've said,
why is it that we--

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.310 align:middle line:84%
have you ever gone
on the internet?

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:50.268 align:middle line:90%
I went on the internet.

01:11:50.268 --> 01:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
some new UFO photos.

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a crisis!

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what I was met with
when I looked for new cases

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:58.710 align:middle line:84%
and things like that
that we could talk about,

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
share, and exchange
and all that?

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I go on these different
websites, and what do I see?

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Creepy aliens.

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Dark conspiracies.

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Things with horns, and devils,
and all this dark, dark stuff.

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at this
like, ugh, the energy in that

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:18.420 align:middle line:90%
is just not good.

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.420 align:middle line:90%
Where is the legitimacy in UFOs?

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Where is the legitimacy of
legitimizing this science

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
without getting into
all that tchotchke stuff

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.550 align:middle line:90%
that you see on Facebook.

01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.500 align:middle line:90%
You know, demons and aliens.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Go to Monster Con.

01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:34.410 align:middle line:90%
I went to Monster Con.

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I went to-- what was
that one that they had--

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:39.378 align:middle line:90%
the first Alien Con in San Jose.

01:12:39.378 --> 01:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
I was invited the
last minute, right?

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Kind of, like, the last four
days or something like that.

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:44.670 align:middle line:84%
They said, Robert, come
and talk to these people.

01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:45.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:45.860 align:middle line:90%
I went there.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know they
were sponsored by UFO--

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.890 align:middle line:84%
they were sponsored by
Monster Con and Comic Con.

01:12:51.890 --> 01:12:52.890 align:middle line:90%
You know, lovely people.

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.262 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to--

01:12:54.262 --> 01:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
if you're filming this,
I really like you guys.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:58.980 align:middle line:90%


01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I
get there, right?

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that before I did
my lecture and everything,

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
I actually got knocked down
by the tail of the alien?

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
You know the movie "Alien?"

01:13:09.690 --> 01:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
That thing with the
jaws and that long tail?

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I actually got knocked
down by the tail.

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up, and there
was a guy inside, right?

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:23.242 align:middle line:84%
He's looking through
the jaws like this.

01:13:23.242 --> 01:13:24.510 align:middle line:90%
You know, like this.

01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking up
at him in this mask.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.250 align:middle line:84%
He took the time to wear
this thing, which is

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
as long as this row of chairs.

01:13:31.810 --> 01:13:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And I looked up and I
thought, get a life.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.070 align:middle line:90%
Get a life, man.

01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing in
that suit, you know?

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.075 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was all fun and well.

01:13:41.075 --> 01:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to know something?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.325 align:middle line:90%
I went and did the lecture.

01:13:43.325 --> 01:13:44.765 align:middle line:90%
I did my presentation, right?

01:13:44.765 --> 01:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to know
something funny?

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people
come out to this thing.

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:49.530 align:middle line:90%
Much bigger than this.

01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Much bigger than
these big holistic

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.700 align:middle line:90%
expos that we go into, right?

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, talk about a
ballroom with like, you know,

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:58.470 align:middle line:90%
700, 800 people at least.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.730 align:middle line:90%
You want to know something?

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
I've never sold so many books as
I did at that particular expo.

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.420 align:middle line:84%
People were hungry
for knowledge.

01:14:05.420 --> 01:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
coming up to me and going,

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.740 align:middle line:90%
you mean there's the real thing?

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, yeah.

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.880 align:middle line:84%
He says, I saw
your presentation.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:15.600 align:middle line:90%
There's the real thing?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.950 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, they don't
say that at Comic Con.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course they don't.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.047 align:middle line:90%
Because you're exposed to that.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:24.380 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.588 align:middle line:84%
You know, that gets you used
to the idea, too, right?

01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:27.820 align:middle line:90%
That was an incredible thing.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.640 align:middle line:90%
So this photo turned up.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
How many people have
seen this photo?

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:32.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Not many.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.540 align:middle line:90%
So this photo-- oh, god.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
I've got to remember what the
name of the force is on this.

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, do you notice
that most of the-- almost all

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%
of the photos that you see--

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.070 align:middle line:90%
this is probably photoshopped.

01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:45.070 align:middle line:90%
I'll be honest with you.

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:46.320 align:middle line:90%
But it's a great shot.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
It's probably photoshopped.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you notice that
most of the shots--

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:50.580 align:middle line:90%
this is Billy Meier.

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember Billy Meier
with this shot?

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.060 align:middle line:90%
Some people say, oh, come on.

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
That's grandma's pie pan.

01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:00.780 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed that all
the UFO photos are always

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.160 align:middle line:90%
slightly blurry?

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
They're always not
quite in focus.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
There's never that
definitive photograph

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.340 align:middle line:84%
where, with all of
our photography,

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.140 align:middle line:84%
with the millions
of cell phones,

01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and smartphones, and cameras as
big as those Sonys back there,

01:15:13.890 --> 01:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
there's never the definitive,
undeniable, incredible

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.130 align:middle line:84%
photograph for color
without a doubt.

01:15:20.130 --> 01:15:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I think if
they released that,

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.680 align:middle line:84%
it would probably shatter
the fabric of this reality.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If the Defense
Department came and said,

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
listen, we know these
photos out there.

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:30.060 align:middle line:90%
And, yeah, they are real.

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:31.690 align:middle line:84%
People aren't ready
to handle that.

01:15:31.690 --> 01:15:34.675 align:middle line:84%
You know, they have a society
and a culture to protect.

01:15:34.675 --> 01:15:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They're not ready for that.

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.938 align:middle line:90%
I think ET knows that.

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why they're
slightly out of sight,

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:41.550 align:middle line:90%
out of mind.

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:43.110 align:middle line:90%
More shots of Billy Meier.

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:46.490 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, the
one back in 2004.

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.370 align:middle line:10%
The rods in Manchester, UK.

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:51.240 align:middle line:10%
This was taken in 2011.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:54.570 align:middle line:10%
Hovering devices that
hover over the ground

01:15:54.570 --> 01:15:56.880 align:middle line:10%
in one form or another.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.790 align:middle line:10%
Most of our visitors,
again, you know, come

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.690 align:middle line:10%
in many forms and many
different kinds of crafts.

01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:05.010 align:middle line:10%
This one is interesting.

01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:06.718 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if this
one is photoshopped,

01:16:06.718 --> 01:16:09.420 align:middle line:10%
but of all the photos I
could find, I found this one.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.720 align:middle line:10%
Probably one of the most
interesting, you know?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.450 align:middle line:10%
This is Jack Nethering
from ufoevidence.org.

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:20.250 align:middle line:10%
A remarkable photograph.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:23.100 align:middle line:10%
But, again, nobody
can really confirm it.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that these photos cannot
be confirmed because I think

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe ET knows we're
not ready for that.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they're just-- this
is just like to protect

01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.980 align:middle line:10%
the culture and the society.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:34.780 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:36.000 align:middle line:10%
It's a theory.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.410 align:middle line:10%
This here in Ely Cathedral,
United Kingdom in 2009

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.210 align:middle line:10%
was quite good.

01:16:39.210 --> 01:16:40.585 align:middle line:10%
That's actually
not photoshopped.

01:16:40.585 --> 01:16:44.120 align:middle line:10%
That's actually a
fairly good photograph.

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.300 align:middle line:10%
So we'll see.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.000 align:middle line:10%
You know, they surround
the globe daily.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.130 align:middle line:10%
There was something like
18,000 sightings last year.

01:16:50.130 --> 01:16:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it was something
18,000 plus that MUFON amassed

01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.105 align:middle line:84%
or reported, or
something like that.

01:16:56.105 --> 01:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So in all those
sightings, if you

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.510 align:middle line:84%
had 18,000 reports or whatever,
wouldn't there be, like,

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:03.060 align:middle line:90%
one or two really great photos?

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
You got to know that maybe
it's meant to be that way.

01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's because
of us and for us.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:11.280 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.850 align:middle line:10%
So our conclusion before we
go to a few questions here.

01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:16.510 align:middle line:10%
As I've said, you
know, we're really--

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:18.427 align:middle line:10%
you've seen that there's,
like, a large amount

01:17:18.427 --> 01:17:20.310 align:middle line:10%
of personal growth
in my talks because I

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:22.980 align:middle line:10%
felt like you've got
to mix spirituality

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.300 align:middle line:10%
with this UFO science.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.750 align:middle line:10%
You've got to find that common
ground to legitimize it.

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise we have talking
heads that go up there

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:34.860 align:middle line:84%
and they tell you about well,
after the screaming stopped,

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.210 align:middle line:90%
and then the rest of the story.

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:37.555 align:middle line:90%
Those are sensational.

01:17:37.555 --> 01:17:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But, ultimately, I
think it's important

01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that we take away that
time-- like I said,

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
the meditation, the
time for ourself

01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
to make contact
and practice that.

01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:50.400 align:middle line:90%
Our world is rapidly changing.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Be prepared for anything.

01:17:52.290 --> 01:17:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We are the wayshowers,
the transition team.

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
We're reconnecting humanity
with a divine intelligence,

01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:01.260 align:middle line:84%
and that divine intelligence
is all around us.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:03.643 align:middle line:84%
You can't necessarily
see your thoughts, right?

01:18:03.643 --> 01:18:04.560 align:middle line:90%
But they're happening.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You have reasoning, all
this that's going on.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:11.310 align:middle line:84%
We're living in an unprecedented
time of opportunity.

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:15.810 align:middle line:10%
Let's fill it with love and
consciousness, shall we?

01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:17.075 align:middle line:10%
I have my book--

01:18:17.075 --> 01:18:18.450 align:middle line:10%
"Divine Blueprint"
is still here,

01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:19.480 align:middle line:10%
if you're interested in that.

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You can pick that up.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.160 align:middle line:90%
I have some used copies.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Take it home for $5.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe take a new one for $10.

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:28.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you're here at the
expo, watch what's happening.

01:18:28.990 --> 01:18:30.240 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot here.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:34.180 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of wonderful,
wonderful people here.

01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
thank Gaia TV, who

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:42.000 align:middle line:84%
has provided wonderful platform
in their television who

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.330 align:middle line:84%
have provided wonderful
speakers and me an opportunity

01:18:45.330 --> 01:18:46.950 align:middle line:90%
now to be filmed by them.

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:48.548 align:middle line:90%
They're marvelous.

01:18:48.548 --> 01:18:49.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's where it's at.

01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:51.120 align:middle line:90%
Do I have some questions here?

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Before we just leave, we'll
part with a few quick questions.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever had anyone
express what those beings that

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.900 align:middle line:90%
you saw are [INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever had anybody
give an intuitive--

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:09.842 align:middle line:90%
I have, actually.

01:19:09.842 --> 01:19:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it anything related
to artificial intelligence

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:15.387 align:middle line:90%
in the future?

01:19:15.387 --> 01:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's been said.

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.512 align:middle line:84%
That they actually would
come from the equivalent

01:19:18.512 --> 01:19:21.030 align:middle line:90%
of what would be our future.

01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And to transcend--
think about it.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
To transcend the incredible
distance it would even

01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
take to get here, time
and space literally

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
has to be altered in
such a way to enter

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:36.150 align:middle line:84%
in at a particular time zone, a
particular geographic location,

01:19:36.150 --> 01:19:38.940 align:middle line:90%
a particular objective.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
That kind of goes
sideways with my theory

01:19:41.790 --> 01:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
that they're living in
their perpetual moment.

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:46.720 align:middle line:90%
But time is a very funny thing.

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.700 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I had a very
specific reading about this

01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
by a marvelous, marvelous woman
who's not with us anymore--

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.840 align:middle line:90%
but she read for me--

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.420 align:middle line:90%


01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
you can't imagine.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And this was very early on.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I was only 23 when
she read for me.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.170 align:middle line:90%
It was 1978.

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Late 1978.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I
have something to tell you

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:13.290 align:middle line:90%
about what these beings are.

01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:14.370 align:middle line:90%
And I say, yes?

01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And she says, they're
related to you.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.840 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me?

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.930 align:middle line:90%
They're related?

01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:21.760 align:middle line:84%
She says, yes, they
know who you are.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:22.900 align:middle line:90%
They're related to you.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.880 align:middle line:84%
But you won't know that
while you're born here--

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
while you're here because
you're here in this experience.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:32.020 align:middle line:84%
You're here to experience
all these lessons.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:35.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why you come
into the material world.

01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And then they may have appeared
from time, space, and distance,

01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and they have these
suits, so they

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
can exist in their
material plane for the way

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:46.280 align:middle line:90%
that they're able to do it.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But when you pass away,
you will meet them again.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:52.365 align:middle line:84%
You know, as traumatic as that
experience was, as incredible

01:20:52.365 --> 01:20:54.490 align:middle line:84%
as that experience was, do
you know that I've never

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:55.490 align:middle line:90%
had one dream with it?

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

01:20:56.290 --> 01:20:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Not one.

01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
I've never had--
you know when you

01:20:58.210 --> 01:20:59.668 align:middle line:84%
have a traumatic
experience, you'll

01:20:59.668 --> 01:21:00.800 align:middle line:90%
relive it in your dreams?

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I've actually never
had one dream about it.

01:21:06.430 --> 01:21:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's a remarkable,
incredible world.

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.167 align:middle line:84%
That's why I said in
the very beginning,

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:13.297 align:middle line:84%
everything is possible,
even the impossible.

01:21:13.297 --> 01:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We have one last--
couple of last questions,

01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:18.580 align:middle line:84%
then we're going back into the
expo and experience the magic,

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the wonder.

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that that
experience that you had is

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
actually seating you to be
a part of this conscious

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
awareness shift so that you're
actually up there right now?

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.044 align:middle line:84%
And where you progressed
as your experience and--

01:21:36.044 --> 01:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
you know, you've
been talking about--

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:40.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --to make this happen?

01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I think that when something
like that happens--

01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I never thought years ago
I'd ever been an author.

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.560 align:middle line:90%
Really?

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.120 align:middle line:84%
If somebody had told me that,
you're going to be an author

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.495 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be out
there speaking.

01:21:50.495 --> 01:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, and sometimes there's
six people at a little meeting.

01:21:53.170 --> 01:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's much,
much larger than that.

01:21:55.590 --> 01:22:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I never dreamed I was going
to be doing this, you know?

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've taken a lot of flak
for some of my theories,

01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.090 align:middle line:90%
but so do the rest.

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.320 align:middle line:90%
You know who their names are.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.940 align:middle line:84%
They've taken a lot of flak
for their theories or whatever.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:14.230 align:middle line:90%
I certainly have.

01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:19.030 align:middle line:84%
I've been told, oh, quack,
and nut case, and, oh,

01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:20.380 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't--

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%
is it sensationalism?

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:24.360 align:middle line:84%
They would say things like,
what is it about, Robert?

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it about validation?

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Significance?

01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:28.360 align:middle line:90%
Is it about approval?

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Did your mother-- did
your father beat you?

01:22:30.700 --> 01:22:31.720 align:middle line:90%
What happened here?

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Why do you have to
tell such a story?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.205 align:middle line:84%
I said, because it's
just part of my story.

01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:36.580 align:middle line:84%
But along the way,
you've noticed

01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:38.860 align:middle line:84%
the presentation
is my story of what

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:40.463 align:middle line:84%
happened with the
extraterrestrials,

01:22:40.463 --> 01:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
but it's also all the things
that I've found along the way

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
that I hope will benefit,
move forward, and move, touch,

01:22:46.630 --> 01:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and inspire each
and every person.

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what our job
is is to go out there, move,

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:54.350 align:middle line:90%
touch, and inspire people.

01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.150 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:22:55.150 --> 01:22:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Let's go out there and do that.

01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming tonight.

01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.820 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.

01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:58.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm Robert Perala.

01:22:58.730 --> 01:22:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You guys are great.

01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:01.758 align:middle line:90%
I'm very touched and honored.
