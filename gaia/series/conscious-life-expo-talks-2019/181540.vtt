00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:90%
My name is Sunny Chayes.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm one of the introducers
here at Conscious Life Expo.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And I have the absolute pleasure
to introduce a person who's

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.610 align:middle line:90%
going to be speaking today.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.830 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking about
what I wanted to say.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking I could talk
about the movie she's been in,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:90%
and she will be.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I can talk about her
expertise in different things.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I could talk about
her just many things

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.910 align:middle line:90%
that you can actually Google.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And I recommend that you do.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
But after being
here this weekend,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.690 align:middle line:84%
I realize there's
so many people.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure everyone
in here is just,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:90%
I want to make a difference.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to have a better life.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I want to figure
out how to do it.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:10%
I have some pain.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:90%
I have some issues.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
And how do I get there?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:90%
How do I have the best life?

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And you are in the
right place today

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:84%
to find that out because through
Dr. Sue Morter's protocols,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.370 align:middle line:84%
her short answer, her amazing
book that is coming out,

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:84%
which I love, on March 19
called "The Energy Codes--

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
A 7-Step System to Awaken
Your Spirit, Heal Your Body,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:90%
and Live Your Best Life"--

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and I also like to say,
and find your home [LAUGHS]

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.370 align:middle line:84%
in your heart and what we're
doing here and why we're here

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and what's it all about--

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
you are definitely going
to have quite a day today.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.335 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so grateful you're
all here because you're all

00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
going to make such a
difference in your lives

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and in everyone around you.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we can welcome
a big way-- let

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
us get the party started with
Dr. Sue Morter this morning.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Come on down.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.970 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Woo-hoo!

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Hey, hey.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.556 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Ah, welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We have two hours to
change your world, OK?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] That's OK, thanks.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.450 align:middle line:90%
All right, so wow.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
There's so much
that I look forward

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.060 align:middle line:84%
to sharing with
you, all of which

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:84%
is designed, first of
all, to allow us to become

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.610 align:middle line:90%
the self-healers that we are.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's much more than that.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Healing happens in your
body as a byproduct

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.600 align:middle line:84%
of you recognizing the
truth of who you are

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
and embodying that,
awakening and embodying

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.180 align:middle line:84%
the true magnificence
that we are.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:90%
We are cosmic beings.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:90%
We are universal intelligence.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to share with
you some research and that kind

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.920 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just going to infuse
it into some user-friendly

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.890 align:middle line:84%
practices that allow
you to actually go

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
home today with some
techniques and some strategies

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and some know-how about how to
integrate my system so that I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
can start to perceive myself
as this universal cosmic

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:90%
intelligence that I truly am.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.880 align:middle line:84%
We are miraculous, just
in our very makeup.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.590 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do before we
get started is, first of all,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.720 align:middle line:84%
thank Conscious Life Expo for
having this amazing gathering

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
of an amazing number
of eclectic people

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.320 align:middle line:84%
gathered together just
discovering and exploring

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.090 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of aspects
of life that we

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
don't get exposed to outside of
really making an effort to dive

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.310 align:middle line:90%
into something like this.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And I also want to
thank Gaia TV, who

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
has been doing a
tremendous job of accessing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the planet
with this information

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:84%
that we get to have
in our conversations.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So we're connecting with
people all over the globe.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is about
time, wouldn't you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
say, that we can have a global
partnership a global community

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that is awake, that is holding
fast to a vibration that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
matters so that we can start
to dissolve that which doesn't

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:84%
matter, which is, in
large part, what's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:84%
been structuring so much
of our culture and so much

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of our communities in
many different ways.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So here we are,
breaking the boundaries,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:84%
breaking the barriers,
and dissolving the idea

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.330 align:middle line:84%
that there is a here and
a there and that we all

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:84%
get to be together in
this collective way.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.730 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, Gaia TV.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.529 align:middle line:84%
My background is I am in
health care all my life.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:10%
I've been a practicing
clinician in natural health care

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.480 align:middle line:10%
for 30-some years and was
trained as a chiropractor.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:84%
But I was raised in
a household where

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the pioneers of
energy medicine lived.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So my father, Dr.
MT Morter Jr., was

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.430 align:middle line:84%
a pioneer in what was considered
then very strange ideas.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
It was before energy
medicine existed.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to know, why did some
of his patients heal and some

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of his patients didn't?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And he was constantly
exploring what

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:90%
was the common denominator.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.390 align:middle line:84%
And it took him
down to, basically,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.160 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic energy field.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It took him from
addressing issues regarding

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
health and wholeness
via the nervous system

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and the functional
capacity and direction

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
that chiropractic and natural
health care rose up through.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And he recognized that bones
were out of place for a reason.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And the chiropractor would
put it back in place.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And the bone would
go back out of place.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.810 align:middle line:90%
And he'd put it back in place.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And he was in this ping-pong
game with his patients.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And he was like, I'm not
going to do this all my life.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.062 align:middle line:84%
So he started inquiring,
why does the bone

00:05:35.062 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
keep going back out of place?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And so that took him into,
not the spinal nerve level,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
but it took him up
to the high brain

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:84%
centers that basically, the
nervous system was perceiving

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that there was a reason for
that muscle to be tight.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.968 align:middle line:84%
And it was tight in a defensive
physiology kind of state,

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:54.510 align:middle line:84%
like if a bear came
in the room, it's

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.300 align:middle line:84%
appropriate for the muscles
around your spine to be tight.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And if they get locked
into that pattern,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
they remain tight even when
the bear goes away, right?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.760 align:middle line:84%
So he then began
to recognize, we're

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:84%
not actually in front
of bears all that often.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not actually really
happening this way.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And so he recognized
that there are many types

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of bears in our lives.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.855 align:middle line:84%
There are chemical imbalance
bears through nutrition,

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:84%
through thoughts
and the stresses

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.620 align:middle line:84%
that you create because of the
chemistries that get generated

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
by the thoughts that you think.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So how that
translates, folks, is

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can eat a perfect
diet that is alkalizing,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
that is giving nutrients,
that is balanced

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:90%
in an alkaline ash fashion--

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.870 align:middle line:84%
which I'm happy to touch on
if we have some moments today.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
You can do that and think
negative thoughts that

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
are producing more acid
than you can create

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:90%
by eating an alkaline ash diet.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So you can eclipse it, just dupe
yourself right in the moment.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So I hesitate to say
you're better off

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
to eat the chocolate
cake and love it

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.855 align:middle line:84%
than to eat the vegetables
and hate it, OK?

00:06:55.855 --> 00:06:56.655 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:06:56.655 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.480 align:middle line:84%
--I hesitate to give that
advice because everybody's like,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
woo-hoo, Dr. Sue said
chocolate cake is better.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
So just to be clear, we have
to be responsible stewards

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.620 align:middle line:90%
in all of this.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.880 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is that
my father's research then

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.908 align:middle line:84%
took him into recognizing that
there were all kinds of bears.

00:07:14.908 --> 00:07:16.200 align:middle line:90%
There could be emotional bears.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that was
the number one reason

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that people's
energy got blocked.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Their nervous system
got out of balance

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.320 align:middle line:84%
and got locked into an
out-of-balance state.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going
to tell you today,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about energy flow.

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to give you
this little bit of background

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
because there's so
much more to what

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
I have to share with you
than what we have time

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:90%
for in this box of time today.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So in his research, he
recognized that there

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:90%
were physical injury bears.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
There were emotional bears,
chemical imbalance bears.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
There could be inheritance
bears, you bet.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
But mostly what
was inherited was

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:84%
dispositions and cultural
ways of living, not so much

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.270 align:middle line:84%
that your genetic inheritance
was going to dictate your life

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And this was in the late
'60s and the early '70s.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Since then, there has been
a tremendous out-pouring

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
of information
through epigenetics.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're probably familiar
with Dr. Bruce Lipton.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
He's an old family
friend and is very much

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
a part of what's woven
into my very fabric.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So I was raised in this
environment where all

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:90%
this research was taking place.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And it was our dinner
table conversation.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
We were speaking about how
thoughts generate your reality

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and how it affects
your physiology.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And it ultimately determines
the level of health and vitality

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that you have and
the ability to heal

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
that it gets to express
through your system, et cetera.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the only health
care that I've ever had.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
I've never gone to the doctor
and gotten an antibiotic

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
for some ailment, for some
issue to have it heal me

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.470 align:middle line:90%
from a pill out of a bottle.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned the
other day, I'm 86 years old.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very important
to listen to everything

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
that I have to say.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.190 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So in
this, what I know,

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
not because I've read it and
researched it and calculated

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and analyzed down
to this statement

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that I'm about to
make, it's because

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.630 align:middle line:84%
of my personal
experience with such,

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:84%
that the body has the
capacity to heal itself.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:84%
It is built with
everything that it needs.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't healing,
there's a reason.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And we go beyond, way beyond,
the capacity to self-heal.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:84%
We are supposed to
be self-illuminated,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
self-referencing,
self-regulating.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:84%
We are ultimately
supposed to be aware

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:90%
of our multidimensionality.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we are not
is simply a circuitry issue.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
explain to you what

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean by that because
it's imperative for us

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that there is
nothing wrong with anyone.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing broken.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.030 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing missing.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Everything is absolutely
impacted into your system.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.218 align:middle line:84%
You are made of the everything
that you've been seeking.

00:10:04.218 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we
live in a culture that

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
has us so obsessed and
externally oriented

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:84%
with our power, to the
drugs or the surgeries

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that's going
to fix whatever is going on,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:90%
is criminal.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to just
shape shift this one

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
person at a time.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to just take it
back and do something with it.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to be
responsible stewards.

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I don't
want is for someone

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
who's on a few medications
to go home and chuck them

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.830 align:middle line:84%
out the window
because Dr. Sue said

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.360 align:middle line:90%
we don't need this anymore.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And no, there's a way
to regulate the system

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
and to shift this in
a responsible fashion.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So of course, be
smart about this.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to infuse the idea
into us once again that we are

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.948 align:middle line:90%
made of everything that exists.

00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
share that with you.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So that inherently
gives us the reality

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to operate from that we
have the capacity to do,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:84%
to achieve, to accomplish,
to experience anything

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:90%
that we so choose.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I find
are the greatest limitations

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:84%
is that we have not been
told the things that

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
are available for us to
even set our sights on.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
limited possibility world.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So thinking positive is not
even going to do the trick.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to explain
what I mean by that.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.230 align:middle line:84%
We are currently
living in a world that

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
now thinks that it's time
for us to think positive

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
if we want to think positive
and have a positive effect

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and raise our vibrational
frequency so that we

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.112 align:middle line:90%
can self-heal.

00:11:41.112 --> 00:11:42.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to know
that I've been working

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.122 align:middle line:90%
with people for 30 years.

00:11:44.122 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And when they get
on the bandwagon,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
like getting religion
and saying, (DEEPER TONE)

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
think positive,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and when my wife
thinks negative,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.387 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
let her, I'm just

00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:54.640 align:middle line:84%
going to tell her to turn it
around and think differently,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
it's like, whoa, time
out, because if we

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
do that, we end up bypassing
authentic vibrational

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that
are essential for us

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to integrate into the system.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.130 align:middle line:84%
To embrace every single
vibrational frequency that we

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.290 align:middle line:90%
are is what creates wholeness.

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It's not about cutting half
of the emotional states out

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
of the picture and
thinking that if I only

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
live in these positive
emotional states,

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to raise my vibration.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:84%
You will raise your vibration,
but you will not heal.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.080 align:middle line:90%
You won't heal necessarily.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, it
won't be sustainable

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
creating wholeness.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:90%
You're creating conditionality.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And the more you are obsessed
with only ever being positive,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.010 align:middle line:84%
just as an example,
the more you will

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
be afraid of anything
negative that you've

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
deemed as negative coming along
and having an impact on you.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, you
become more conditional

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and try to control your
environment so that you're

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
sure that you're
able to stay positive

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:90%
no matter what goes on this day.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about
only sticking around

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts or positive
people or positive things.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Although, of course,
that's a great idea.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's something
deeper that I really

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
want us to understand because
we are awakening to the fact

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
that we have the capacity to
have an outcome because of how

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:90%
we intend our life to go.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:84%
We are awakening
to the idea that I

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
have some say over my health
and my wholeness and my life

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:84%
experience and my perception
of what's possible.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I have free will.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And I can use that
free will to generate

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
a different outcome
than, perhaps,

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
previously I felt
empowered to do.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea is, how
do I become more empowered?

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
How do I become more
empowered than I was before?

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:10%
As we are empowering,
as we are awakening

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:10%
to this empowered state,
it becomes essential

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.988 align:middle line:10%
that we utilize our
faculties in a way that

00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:57.530 align:middle line:10%
truly is going to give us the
outcome that we're looking for.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of
what I want to share.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.061 align:middle line:90%
So I want to see if I have a--

00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I have
one of these images

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
here, so I'm just going
to describe it to you.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think
about your brain

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
with a trapdoor in the middle.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And above the trapdoor
is your conscious mind.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And below the trapdoor
is your subconscious.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And this trapdoor is
supposed to remain open

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
so that when you decide that
it's time to relax, you relax.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you decide that
it's time to be loving,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:90%
you're able to be loving.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.580 align:middle line:84%
When you don't have
to be doing something,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
your body automatically
turns its energies

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
toward healing and filtering
and cleansing and replenishing

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and rejuvenating, et cetera.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when that trapdoor
is open, all systems go.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens is,
when we see a bear,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that message gets sent into
the cortex above the trapdoor.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it gets shot back
into an area called memory.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.180 align:middle line:90%
And it looks up, what is "bear"?

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So it looks up "bear" in
this file storage room.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And it says, run for
your life, basically, OK?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:90%
And so you take off running.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So when the bear goes away, you
look, you see the bear is gone.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And that message
goes into the cortex

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
and goes to this area
called subconscious memory.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And it goes to the
file storage room.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And you look up under
"BG" for "bear gone."

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.720 align:middle line:90%
And it says, exhale, relax.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.110 align:middle line:84%
That message then gets shot
down through the trapdoor

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.630 align:middle line:84%
into the body, and
your body relaxes.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.560 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So messages go from the
cortex down here, boom.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
This is how the
nervous system works.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:84%
So if 10 bears are
coming at the same time,

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
that message is getting
shot back into memory.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
10 bears, it's
run for your life,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
run for your life,
run for your life.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.592 align:middle line:84%
The message goes down
through the trapdoor.

00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
It says, emergency,
emergency, emergency.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And it can be so
overwhelming to the system

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.140 align:middle line:90%
that the trapdoor slams shut.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And the last message that
got through was emergency.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
learn a technique today

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:84%
to open this trapdoor so
that you have the capacity

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.170 align:middle line:84%
to relax when the bears are
actually gone because when

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that trapdoor slams shut and the
last message that got through

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:84%
was emergency, your body
is continuing to function

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
in emergency mode even
though you go on vacation

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and you can't relax.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:84%
You go on the weekend, and
your mind is constantly

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
going because it's
trying to identify, what

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.850 align:middle line:90%
is it, what is it, what is it?

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:90%
Where's the bear?

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:29.450 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I sense that there's a bear, OK?

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to tell you, from
a quantum science standpoint,

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.145 align:middle line:84%
this whole thing from
another direction

00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
because I really want
you to understand

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.240 align:middle line:90%
what's really going on here.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But this is tangible
nervous system stuff.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to know
because our culture is obsessed

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
with learning about
the brain and learning

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:90%
about neuro this or neuro that.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
We were on a panel
yesterday and said

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that if you say the word
"neuro" before anything,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody's interested
in listening and learning

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:84%
You say the word "quantum,"
the same thing is true.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do both,
OK, not for those reasons,

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.890 align:middle line:90%
but just because it's what's up.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.690 align:middle line:90%
It's what's real.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:90%
It's what's true.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But I want us to understand
the role of the nervous system

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.317 align:middle line:84%
relative to the quantum
being because you

00:17:08.317 --> 00:17:10.359 align:middle line:84%
can have an effect on your
nervous system [SNAPS]

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.819 align:middle line:90%
like that, OK?

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.000 align:middle line:84%
So if the last message that
got through the trapdoor

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
before it slammed
shut was emergency,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
your system is operating
in emergency day and night,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
day and night, in and out, week
after week, month after month,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:90%
year after year.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
It never lets up because
the number one priority

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.160 align:middle line:90%
for your system is survival.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is going to operate
on a survival basis.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And it will always deal with
the most life-threatening thing

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
first until it
goes to the second.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you have back pain
that is unrelenting,

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that's not going
away, it might be

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:84%
because there's
something else that's

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
in higher priority that
won't let your body go

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to work on your back pain
because your back pain is not

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:90%
life-threatening.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
But maybe chemical
balance is, for instance.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow what I'm saying?

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So if something's not
healing and something's not

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
moving or shifting in your
life, there's a reason.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's a quality reason.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And we can detect what
it is and work with it.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.397 align:middle line:84%
It is so imperative
that we don't just

00:18:07.397 --> 00:18:09.480 align:middle line:84%
start becoming apathetic
or think that it's always

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be this way, or
my mother had this, too,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
or my father was this way, and
here I am, it's my lot in life.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.570 align:middle line:90%
It's not the case.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:17.470 align:middle line:90%
That is not the case.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.780 align:middle line:90%
It's not what's going on.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And all we have to do is
learn a little bit more,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.790 align:middle line:84%
remember a little bit
more about who we are,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and learn about how
the system works

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become
masterful at this in this life,

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:90%
because we're supposed to be.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] We're supposed to be.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're asking
for something out there,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're just really
over the top, self-consumed,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and you're asking for too much.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
These are the basic
things that are supposed

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.780 align:middle line:84%
to be existing in
our systems because

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:90%
of how we are designed, OK?

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So we just haven't been
taught how to do that.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.510 align:middle line:90%
We just haven't been taught how.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.070 align:middle line:90%
So now we learn.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.160 align:middle line:84%
All right, so in this we have
to get the trapdoor open.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.427 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:84%
The trapdoor has to get open
so that when we consciously

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:84%
decide that it's safe
to relax, we relax.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we consciously
decide that you'd

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.540 align:middle line:84%
love to be innovative
and creative

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and come up with new ideas and
a plan for your life and a path

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and carve it out and
have a sense of self

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
and know what you're
here for and what you're

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
doing, that when we choose
to direct our attention

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
to such things, that they
actually become obvious to us

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:22.650 align:middle line:90%
and we have answers.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And we can stay in emotion
and pick up momentum and have

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
the life experience that
we want to have personally

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and make a contribution to
humanity at the same time,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because they are one
and the same, actually.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.830 align:middle line:84%
There's only one of us
here, as quantum science

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.180 align:middle line:90%
would have us understand.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's you.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, when
my linear mind started

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:84%
landing on that years ago, it
was like, well, which one of us

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
is it?

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle line:84%
Which one of us
is it that's here?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.602 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel like I'm here.

00:19:50.602 --> 00:19:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel like you're here?

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:52.710 align:middle line:90%
Woo.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, yes.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's so confusing
until it's not.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't need
to be confusing.

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:02.020 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be inspiring to us.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:90%
So get this.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
thing happening here.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it is good.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.278 align:middle line:90%
It is in your favor.

00:20:07.278 --> 00:20:08.695 align:middle line:84%
There is only one
thing happening.

00:20:08.695 --> 00:20:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's consciousness
is awakening through you.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And you volunteered to
come here onto the frontier

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
so that you can play a
role in exactly that.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You are here working on
certain vibrational frequencies

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's courage.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's forgiveness.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's self-love.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's adventure.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's joy.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
What I know for
sure is that it all

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.350 align:middle line:84%
boils down to a
greater sense of love

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
than has ever been experienced
before, because in all--

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to start to move
into the quantum conversation

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:90%
piece of this.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
But I just want
you to understand

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:84%
that the nervous system
does play a role.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So neuroscience and quantum
science are so intertwined,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
they really shouldn't
be studied separately.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But what it does is
it forces us to begin

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
to observe that the nervous
system is actually functioning

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.480 align:middle line:84%
very differently than we
thought it was when we thought

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.550 align:middle line:84%
that the only
thing that was real

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
was the stuff that we
could go into a cadaver lab

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:84%
and dissect out of
the human system,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that that's what was tangible
and real and physical.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So what we're now
doing is recognizing

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.370 align:middle line:84%
that our definition of physical,
pff, doesn't work anymore.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a continuum.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:84%
That energy all the way to
physicality, it's all energy.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just a spectrum of energy.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're supposed to have
access to the full spectrum.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not two separate worlds.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not the invisible,
energetic world

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and the physical,
tangible world.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
a world in between

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
that merges the
whole thing together.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And so people that
can see auras,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
myself included, people
that can see energy or feel

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.810 align:middle line:84%
or sense or perceive,
the empath that is here,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is living in between these
worlds and feeling frustrated

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and a little frightened at times
because they feel and sense

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and perceive things that
nobody else is validating.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they start to
wobble and wonder,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:90%
well, who the heck am I?

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:90%
And what is real?

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's time for us
to bridge these worlds

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and to meld it all together
back into the continuum

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we do not
experience ourselves

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
as a limited, individual,
separate self, because it's not

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that we've been
living inside of that lie

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.670 align:middle line:84%
is what's causing
us so much pain.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's actually what
shuts down the nervous system

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:90%
faster than anything.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's the biggest
bear that you've ever met--

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
the biggest bear of the
bears that we've been

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.000 align:middle line:90%
having this conversation with.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:84%
It's the thing that slams
shut the trapdoor faster

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.440 align:middle line:84%
than anything else in
your life because it's

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.055 align:middle line:90%
this inherent sentence.

00:22:39.055 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like a death sentence.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It's like a jail sentence that
is constantly looming over you.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's for a crime
you didn't commit.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.790 align:middle line:84%
It's for something that isn't
even true, that doesn't exist.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
that we've bitten

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.230 align:middle line:84%
into because consciousness
was only developing

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.240 align:middle line:90%
as fast as it could develop.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And you came here to
awaken to yourself

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.360 align:middle line:84%
as the conscious
creator that you are,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
not to have it handed to
you on a silver spoon, OK?

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the process
of that discovery.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And in that, you accentuate
your personal empowerment

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.050 align:middle line:84%
because you're discovering
it on your own.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:10%
And because you're accentuating
your personal empowerment,

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.320 align:middle line:10%
you are bringing to
the third dimension

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.280 align:middle line:10%
a level of consciousness
that is absolutely required

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:10%
for wholeness to exist here in
the third dimension on planet

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:28.420 align:middle line:10%
Earth.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.360 align:middle line:10%
We are evolving consciously
from a three-dimensional being

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:10%
to a fourth-dimensional being.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And love is the key.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Love is the fourth
dimensional energy

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:90%
that we are evolving into.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So as we develop a greater
sense of self, which is not

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
just self-esteem, it's
really like, until we start

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.910 align:middle line:84%
to recognize who we really
are, what we really are,

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
it's really impossible
to become that.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.370 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:54.520 align:middle line:84%
If I think of myself
as a separate self

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:84%
and I'm trying to heal,
but my healing would happen

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:01.780 align:middle line:84%
automatically if I knew myself
as not separate but part

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
of a grand, great
energy field, a greater

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.490 align:middle line:84%
degree of consciousness,
a big bandwidth of unity

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, if I
knew that to be true,

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
then healing on
the physical level

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.790 align:middle line:84%
would happen so
much more easily.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense yet?

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Are we tracking along here?

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to
show you some things

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:21.425 align:middle line:84%
that I think will
make it easier,

00:24:21.425 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
as well, some simple
drawings to just, like,

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:84%
let's break this
down and make it

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.510 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS] doable for ourselves.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
So in the process of that, once
we start to recognize ourselves

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
as multidimensional beings,
not just three-dimension,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:84%
but many more than that, once
I start to recognize myself

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
as a stream of energy
rather than a bubble,

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.120 align:middle line:90%
a separate self like a bubble--

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.170 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you put pressure on
a bubble, what does it do?

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:90%
It pops.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
If you put pressure on a
stream, what does it do?

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.380 align:middle line:84%
It keeps on moving,
and it picks up power.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
You're watering your flowers
outside, garden hose.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:90%
Shhh.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:06.910 align:middle line:90%
You see some flowers over there.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.140 align:middle line:84%
You try to get the hose to
get the water over there.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
You put your thumb over
the end of the garden hose.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Anybody do garden
hose around here?

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.770 align:middle line:84%
All right, I grew up
on a farm, so I'm all

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:18.820 align:middle line:90%
about this kind of stuff.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.510 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you put your
thumb over the garden hose,

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.443 align:middle line:90%
and the aperture gets smaller.

00:25:24.443 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Shh, the same
amount of water now

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
goes four times further just
because you're putting pressure

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.930 align:middle line:90%
on it.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's how we're
supposed to be operating.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:84%
When we put the squeeze of our
own mental focus onto anything,

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.390 align:middle line:90%
it becomes intensified.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.790 align:middle line:84%
When you put the squeeze
of your own mental focus

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.330 align:middle line:84%
onto the stream of
consciousness that you are,

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:90%
it picks up potency.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.030 align:middle line:90%
You pick up potency.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.350 align:middle line:90%
You pick up power.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I want
you to know yourselves as.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.090 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as
pressure that's supposed

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
to make you pop, because it
would only make you pop--

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:90%
implode or explode--

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.768 align:middle line:84%
if you were perceiving
yourself as a separate entity.

00:26:01.768 --> 00:26:03.227 align:middle line:84%
(DEEPER TONE) I
got to do all this.

00:26:03.227 --> 00:26:04.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all up to me.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:90%
No one can help me.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only one.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Ah, buh, burden, pop.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:90%
I know this from experience, OK?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And that pre-popping state
for me was migraine headaches.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
It was maintaining a scoliosis
in my body that I was born with

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and stress levels so high that,
as a practicing clinician,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I would have to sleep at
lunchtime so that I could

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:90%
handle my afternoon patients.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:90%
That's how intense I was, OK?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.620 align:middle line:84%
All because I saw myself
as a separate self,

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.280 align:middle line:84%
even though I grew up in
a quantum conversation.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing, have you
noticed, to talk about it.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's a different thing
to, have you noticed,

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.180 align:middle line:90%
embody it, right?

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's why this is
all about embodiment.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So the energy codes,
which I teach,

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the book that
is coming out March 19,

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
is all about codifying how
to recognize that you are not

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.560 align:middle line:84%
a separate self, that
the essential self is

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.520 align:middle line:90%
a stream of energy.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.020 align:middle line:90%
You are stream of consciousness.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.715 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about how to embody
that truth rather than just

00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:07.840 align:middle line:84%
intellectualize it, rather
than just talk about it.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So what would happen for me
is I could go to my clinic

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and help patients
with these ideas.

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And if they happen to open
their hearts and drop into it,

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
they would heal.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But I was so in my head
about teaching the stuff

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had grown up
with, do you follow,

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:90%
that I was the one that--

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.343 align:middle line:84%
I could help them heal their
migraine headaches [LAUGHS]

00:27:26.343 --> 00:27:28.093 align:middle line:84%
when I could get out
of bed, when I didn't

00:27:28.093 --> 00:27:29.320 align:middle line:90%
have a headache of my own.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.752 align:middle line:84%
So I started
thinking, OK, Sue, you

00:27:31.752 --> 00:27:33.460 align:middle line:84%
need to listen really
closely when you're

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:84%
talking to these patients
that are healing.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You need to hear
what's going on here.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it is because
of the patients who came to me

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and what I heard myself
sharing with them--

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
particularly after an event
that happened in my life

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that I'll take a few minutes
and share with you because it's

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.040 align:middle line:84%
very relevant to
where we're going, OK?

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I started
hearing myself say to them

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
was how I recognized
that they were

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.750 align:middle line:90%
coming so that I could heal.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And then as I healed and shared
that information with them,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.730 align:middle line:90%
they would heal.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.067 align:middle line:90%
And then more people would come.

00:28:05.067 --> 00:28:06.400 align:middle line:90%
And different people would come.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would heal
in different ways

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:84%
because I was listening to what
was happening in this exchange.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
recognize, it's just

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.940 align:middle line:84%
me showing up to me to help
me heal so that I connect

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:84%
with more people so that
more of the whole of us unify

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:84%
and heal together,
which is just tapping

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:84%
into a certain
vibrational frequency.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a vibrational
frequency that, when

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.670 align:middle line:84%
we train the mind to
dial into that frequency,

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:90%
healing happens.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It can't not because it's
the frequency of wholeness.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very different than
going after symptoms

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and diagnosing and
figuring out, what's

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.040 align:middle line:84%
the treatment protocol
for this exact situation?

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of that
can still happen.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.440 align:middle line:84%
But you better believe
that it's happening because

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of a vibrational shift
in the systems at large,

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
in higher and higher
levels into the one system

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:90%
that we all are representing.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the people in your
lives are representing parts

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:03.230 align:middle line:90%
of your own consciousness.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a rub
there, it's medicine, OK?

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It's medicine.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We learn in this dimension
through friction.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We learn in this dimension
through friction.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.737 align:middle line:84%
And let me just
say this, that you

00:29:12.737 --> 00:29:15.790 align:middle line:84%
are made of the highest
frequency energy that

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.080 align:middle line:90%
exists in this dimension.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.340 align:middle line:90%
You are the highest.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.810 align:middle line:90%
You are the highest.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.600 align:middle line:84%
The real you is the highest
vibrational frequency

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.870 align:middle line:90%
in this dimension.

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that I was going
to share with you an experience

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had because it's relevant
to where I want to take you

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.520 align:middle line:84%
today and send you home with
some ideas that are going

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to be very effective for you
to change how your system is

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:90%
operating.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do with the
stress level that I'm describing

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
and the migraine
headaches and not

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.410 align:middle line:90%
being able to get out of bed.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.980 align:middle line:84%
And another stress in my life--
another relationship had ended,

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and here's where we were.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was just like, I
was stressed to the max.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.600 align:middle line:90%
My mother had just passed.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.800 align:middle line:90%
She was my best friend.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't ready for that and
certainly didn't want it.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was just a tremendously
stressful time in my life.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And I was drawn to meditation.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And I went to meditation
prior to that.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
I went out on my back deck
and asked the heavens,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
I just said, OK, you
show me because I'm

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:90%
doing everything I know to do.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And I'm really good at it.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's working, except
that I'm miserable inside.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.305 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, do you follow?

00:30:25.305 --> 00:30:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not saying
I was good at it

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.513 align:middle line:84%
just because I'm
[EXHALES] good at it.

00:30:28.513 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It was like, no, I
was trying really

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.972 align:middle line:84%
hard to do the right thing,
to be a good daughter,

00:30:32.972 --> 00:30:35.180 align:middle line:84%
to be a good sister, to be
a good citizen, a student,

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:90%
a doctor, all this stuff.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And trying really hard
to be a good anything

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.270 align:middle line:90%
is really exhausting.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:42.830 align:middle line:90%
Have you noticed that one?

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, so what I didn't
know is that all I had to do

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.322 align:middle line:84%
was be me more fully, and
everything would release.

00:30:49.322 --> 00:30:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
that at the time.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I was approaching it from
an intellectual perspective.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Perfectionism is
what that's called.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.900 align:middle line:90%
So I was drawn to meditation.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.280 align:middle line:90%
I sat down in meditation.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.405 align:middle line:90%
And of course, I'm sitting.

00:30:59.405 --> 00:31:00.205 align:middle line:90%
Am I sitting right?

00:31:00.205 --> 00:31:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm peeking out my
eyes all the time.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.590 align:middle line:90%
How do you breathe?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.810 align:middle line:90%
How do you do this thing?

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:07.028 align:middle line:84%
And then I finally
just one day--

00:31:07.028 --> 00:31:09.320 align:middle line:84%
at another time I'll tell
you the details of this story

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.450 align:middle line:84%
because it's really
funny and fascinating.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But I'll just cut to the chase
and say that at one point,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I decided to just sit down and
not care about doing it right

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.080 align:middle line:84%
or doing the right thing
and just have it for myself,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:90%
to claim it.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you this because
it's imperative for you

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.910 align:middle line:90%
to do the same.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
You have to claim it for you,
that no one can do it for you.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you think that you
need something outside of you,

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.370 align:middle line:84%
it starts to distract
and disperse you.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And when it distracts
and disperses you,

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:90%
you become lessened.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:38.372 align:middle line:90%
You become weakened.

00:31:38.372 --> 00:31:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have the power
of the energy coming out

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:84%
of the garden hose to
pierce through the veils

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.980 align:middle line:84%
that you need to pierce through
in order to actually perceive

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and experience yourself as
the multidimensional being

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.340 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.382 align:middle line:90%
Are you tracking with me?

00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Because I know I'm going fast.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Are we good?

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, are you with me?

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:56.540 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I sat
down in this meditation.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And they were chanting a chant
that I wasn't used to chanting,

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.740 align:middle line:90%
so I had to really focus on it.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.570 align:middle line:84%
They were chanting
far too slowly

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
for a perfectionistic
person who was all about,

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.660 align:middle line:90%
let's get this job done.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's go, go, go.

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Hurry up, and meditate.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Ger.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.480 align:middle line:90%
Got to meditate.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:90%
Om, om, om.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.360 align:middle line:84%
OK, it was kind of
like that, you know?

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't going to fly that day.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
They were like,
it was beautiful.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:90%
It was slow motion.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:10%
It was all this different
world from the one that I was--

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.828 align:middle line:10%
I would run down the hallway in
my clinic to get from room one

00:32:24.828 --> 00:32:27.286 align:middle line:10%
to room two to treat people,
to just be pa, pa, pa, pa, pa,

00:32:27.286 --> 00:32:28.086 align:middle line:10%
pa, pa.

00:32:28.086 --> 00:32:28.940 align:middle line:10%
It was like that.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were like,
(SLOWLY) ahh, you know?

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.940 align:middle line:90%
The candles were lit.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.560 align:middle line:90%
The draperies were flowing.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.700 align:middle line:90%
The music was slowly unfolding.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.100 align:middle line:90%
It was om namah shivaya--

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:90%
10 times slower than that, OK?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.000 align:middle line:84%
If we had more time
today, I'd show you

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.208 align:middle line:90%
how slow the whole thing was.

00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:51.930 align:middle line:90%
But it was great, all right?

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:53.280 align:middle line:90%
But there was a reason for it.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.905 align:middle line:84%
There was a reason
for it, because when

00:32:54.905 --> 00:32:57.590 align:middle line:84%
you slow the mind down and
you slow the breath down,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.640 align:middle line:90%
some things can unpack.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:90%
It can unload.

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.115 align:middle line:84%
That rapid moving ceiling
fan that the mind is,

00:33:03.115 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:84%
writing its stories
and wondering

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.310 align:middle line:84%
if it's doing the right
thing good enough--

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and here's your real self.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.580 align:middle line:84%
It's this flowing, blowing
in the candle, wind,

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.960 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff, the draperies.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.760 align:middle line:90%
It's that.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the vibrational
frequency of you versus that.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.110 align:middle line:84%
But we're in this box
that's created by this.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to slow
the mind down in order

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.000 align:middle line:84%
to get in tandem with it
and get up and out and free.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
happened for me that day.

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.430 align:middle line:84%
It was om namah
shivaya, these tones

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.860 align:middle line:84%
that actually move the
energy through the body

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.650 align:middle line:84%
in a specific pattern,
slowing the mind down because

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:37.550 align:middle line:90%
of breathing so slow.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And boom.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I woke up as this.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.540 align:middle line:90%
I woke up right here.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I could see the Earth beneath
me about this big around.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was embedded into it up to
what would have been my knees.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.120 align:middle line:84%
I could see 360
degrees around me

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.850 align:middle line:84%
in every direction in a
light so brilliantly bright,

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.580 align:middle line:84%
it was 10 times brighter
than the brightest day

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.440 align:middle line:90%
in the desert I had ever seen.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was completely at home.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.510 align:middle line:90%
I had been there forever.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I had never left, is
how much I knew it.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I was
always going to be there

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
and that I could direct
my focus in any fashion

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.290 align:middle line:84%
and go into multiple
experiences.

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But what I knew was
that this glorious light

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.969 align:middle line:84%
was becoming love as it
passed through this system.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I was me, but I wasn't
in a physical body.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I was literally a
golden ray of light.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.699 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen a
picture like this.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:27.560 align:middle line:84%
I had never seen
anything like this.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:10%
It blew my circuits to
be in this experience,

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.230 align:middle line:10%
to see a marble-sized
Earth beneath me

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.080 align:middle line:10%
and to be suspended
there, totally knowing

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.739 align:middle line:10%
that this is the truth.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And in that true moment, I knew
that every single one of us

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.770 align:middle line:90%
was this.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
And I had free will because
I could take a big breath

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:46.909 align:middle line:90%
or a little breath.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And if I took a big breath,
this beautiful pink iridescent,

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:84%
translucent horizon, a
blanket of love itself,

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
would rise up like this,
would just raise up.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I would exhale,
ah, it would just

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.180 align:middle line:90%
fall down so gracefully.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:90%
It was so immense.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Just try to imagine
the most distant vista

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever seen,
as far as you could see,

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.770 align:middle line:84%
in every direction
seeing that way,

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and this beautiful
pink iridescent

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.800 align:middle line:84%
blanket of consciousness
rising and falling.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I knew was that
light was becoming love.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And that it was going
through me into this planet,

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.400 align:middle line:84%
into this dimension
is what it was.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.290 align:middle line:84%
I was anchored
multidimensionally at the time.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that this is
what everyone of us was.

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And the degree to which
we allow our breath

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:39.580 align:middle line:84%
to happen without impedance,
without any kind of distraction

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:43.300 align:middle line:84%
or dispersal, that we are
allowing light to become love

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and coming here to
where we are here

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.830 align:middle line:84%
in this dimension
with our focus.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.590 align:middle line:90%


00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me just say
that in that moment,

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.190 align:middle line:84%
the most important
thing would be I

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
knew that there was
nothing missing.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.890 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing broken.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.210 align:middle line:90%
And there was nothing wrong.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.580 align:middle line:84%
There was nowhere to
go, nothing to become.

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:84%
That is child's play
compared to what was.

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:09.130 align:middle line:84%
It was immense and magnificent
and completely exalted.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.080 align:middle line:90%
And so this is who you are.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That is what you are.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And for us to get caught
up in this earthly splat

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.553 align:middle line:90%
is a very common thing.

00:36:19.553 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most
people are living.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the Conscious Life's
take on life's experience,

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.670 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to pull
that back together again.

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:31.270 align:middle line:84%
But in the splat, our mind
goes one way, our breath goes

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.800 align:middle line:90%
another, our body goes another.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have our
faculties together at all.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that splat, we
develop a personality.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:42.120 align:middle line:84%
We develop a level of engagement
way out there on the perimeter.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to
do with who we are.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:84%
It has everything to do with the
byproduct of our landing here.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.190 align:middle line:84%
So we come up
attached to the mind.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And in that attachment
to the mind,

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.170 align:middle line:84%
everything that we experience
is based in duality

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:84%
because the mind's job is
to see the distinctions

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.210 align:middle line:90%
and the differences in things.

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.010 align:middle line:90%
And we live in our heads.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And we're attached to the mind.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And we think that's who we are.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
dualistic experience of life

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:12.790 align:middle line:84%
because we think
that's all there is.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And in that
dualistic experience,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:90%
we think there's a me and a you.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:84%
We think there's
a me and an other.

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
duality that the mind alone

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.470 align:middle line:90%
has to perceive.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we have to do is
pull the mind and the body

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and the breath, which is spirit,
which is you, back together

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:36.430 align:middle line:84%
again so that you can start
to use your faculties in a way

00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that they're designed to
be used in order for you

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to have the life
that you can have.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.820 align:middle line:84%
Your whole being,
you've been operating

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.040 align:middle line:84%
as a part of your
being, wondering

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.313 align:middle line:90%
why you don't feel whole, OK?

00:37:50.313 --> 00:37:51.980 align:middle line:84%
So when someone comes
up to me and says,

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:54.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, I feel just
completely inadequate,

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:84%
I know they're
attached to their mind,

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.242 align:middle line:90%
or they couldn't feel that way.

00:37:59.242 --> 00:38:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
that you can feel

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:03.190 align:middle line:84%
inadequate,
insufficient, in some way

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.030 align:middle line:84%
missing, lacking,
broken, something.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way, is
that if you're identifying

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.420 align:middle line:84%
with only a part of
who you are, then

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
you're naturally going
to feel that way.

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So the key is, we
got to change that.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to pull the
mind back onto the body

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.800 align:middle line:84%
and let the breaths start to
weave them together again,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're
all just energies.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
really want you to get,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.340 align:middle line:90%
that you are this ray of light.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:34.660 align:middle line:84%
You are multiple energies that
are coming to this dimension,

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to further consciousness on
the frontier of consciousness

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.400 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So you are the absolute
unwavering wholeness

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that's coming into the
dualistic experience

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:90%
to bring wholeness to it.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But we start seeking
wholeness from out there.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're never going to find
it because that's actually

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.860 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of what
we've become aware of.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what the outer world is.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.228 align:middle line:84%
And this is what quantum
science is showing us,

00:39:03.228 --> 00:39:05.440 align:middle line:84%
that our life experience
is a reflection

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.050 align:middle line:90%
of our own consciousness.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have to pull our
consciousness back together

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.970 align:middle line:90%
and ground it and integrate it.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we ground
it and integrate it,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.530 align:middle line:84%
it becomes quite
possible for you

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to perceive very
differently than you're

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.970 align:middle line:84%
able to perceive when
you're identified

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.860 align:middle line:84%
as a single
bandwidth of energies

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.370 align:middle line:84%
called the mind field, the
field of the mental self, OK?

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So let me just explain
a little bit about this.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.790 align:middle line:84%
First, let me say that
we're going to take this out

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.290 align:middle line:84%
of the picture for
a moment and just

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.540 align:middle line:84%
look at ourselves as
physical human beings

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:84%
here in the physical
dimension, OK?

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.650 align:middle line:84%
You're actually an energy being
having an energetic experience

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.400 align:middle line:84%
in an energetic world,
but on the spectrum

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic world that we
call the physical dimension.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.030 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:84%
You know how people
will say, are you

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.240 align:middle line:84%
a physical being having
a spiritual experience

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.200 align:middle line:90%
occasionally?

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Or are you a spiritual being
having a physical experience?

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And everybody says, oh, I want
to be a spiritual being having

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.810 align:middle line:90%
a physical experience.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But I want to invite you into
being a spiritual being having

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual experience--
do you follow--

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:11.770 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Is that OK?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Right, because energy
is what you are.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the whole
of the manifest world

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.180 align:middle line:90%
is energy just coming into form.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:22.020 align:middle line:10%
It's just energy compressing
into different vibrational

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.820 align:middle line:10%
frequencies.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you, on the way here
to the physical dimension,

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.930 align:middle line:84%
you are this, this
unified field of energy,

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:35.260 align:middle line:84%
this green energy that goes out
and gets more and more subtle.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It goes on forever.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:90%
It goes on forever.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So somebody standing
right here would

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.250 align:middle line:84%
have the same green
energies coming

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:45.880 align:middle line:84%
into the red, the blue, the
purple, into the physical body.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes out
the other-- you follow?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.110 align:middle line:84%
It's in this way that
we're all connected.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.010 align:middle line:84%
This goes underneath
here and goes on forever.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And every so often, there's
a little compression

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of the energy field that
becomes a stream, a flowing

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.660 align:middle line:84%
stream of consciousness
that is a you or a you

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.745 align:middle line:90%
or a you or a you or a you.

00:41:06.745 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow this?

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.730 align:middle line:84%
All right, we're
a field of energy.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:14.500 align:middle line:10%
And the field has compressions
on it, quickenings if you will.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And that quickening
causes the energy

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to fold over on itself enough
that we have self-awareness

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and that we become
a state of being.

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
That's a conversation
for a deeper time when

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.983 align:middle line:90%
we have more time to unpack it.

00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Don't think you
have to understand

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.103 align:middle line:84%
that in order to
do the practices

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
with you today.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.280 align:middle line:84%
But let's just look
at it this way.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Formless energy, spiritual body
energies, compress and compress

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and compress and compress.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the law of physics,
that physical matter is just

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:90%
compressed energy.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.640 align:middle line:84%
This is physical matter
that's compressed energy.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.970 align:middle line:84%
This thing, this poster, this
chair that you're sitting on,

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.810 align:middle line:84%
the computer monitor that
you're watching at this time,

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.807 align:middle line:90%
it's all just compressed energy.

00:41:54.807 --> 00:41:56.140 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's going on here.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
energy-- everything.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.270 align:middle line:90%
No exceptions.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.400 align:middle line:90%
There are no exceptions to that.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you start looking at
it that way, it's like, wow.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So the more subtle form of
energy I can get in touch with,

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:12.530 align:middle line:84%
the more masterful I become
at this physical life.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:17.110 align:middle line:10%
If I can become a person who is
aware of the subtle energies,

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.850 align:middle line:10%
then I'm aware of
the energy that's

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.490 align:middle line:10%
in the trees, the one that's
in the mountains, the one that

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.520 align:middle line:10%
is streaming down
the rivers, that I'm

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.290 align:middle line:10%
aware of that version of me.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.060 align:middle line:90%
That's how we are all connected.

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Do we follow?

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So this subtle energy, shoo,
it goes through everything.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.330 align:middle line:90%
It's what is.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It's the presence
of is-ness, OK?

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.310 align:middle line:90%
Whoa, we won't go there.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But do you follow
what I'm saying?

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.725 align:middle line:90%
It gets deep pretty fast.

00:42:42.725 --> 00:42:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But I just want you
to get, hey, you're

00:42:44.350 --> 00:42:48.700 align:middle line:84%
made of energy on subtle, less
subtle, less subtle, less,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.670 align:middle line:84%
less, less, less,
less, less, boom, OK?

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We grew up in a world that
said, this is what's real.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:55.898 align:middle line:90%
Science was like, nope.

00:42:55.898 --> 00:42:57.910 align:middle line:84%
See, this is what's
real, right here.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And we're saying, mm.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Quantum science is saying,
no, no, no, no, that's

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:90%
the caboose on the train, folks.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the caboose on the train.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:06.880 align:middle line:90%
You are here.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.700 align:middle line:90%
This isn't you.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.220 align:middle line:90%
This is something you created.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:10.370 align:middle line:90%
This is you.

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.170 align:middle line:90%
This is you.

00:43:11.170 --> 00:43:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And you are compressing,
compressing,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.200 align:middle line:84%
compressing,
compressing, compressing

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.530 align:middle line:84%
yourself to come here to
this physical dimension, OK?

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So after my big awakening
like this, days later--

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.560 align:middle line:90%
only days later--

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I had an experience of becoming.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.590 align:middle line:84%
The moment that I
chose to become,

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:84%
it was as if the words
were spoken, yes, I am.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.480 align:middle line:90%
It was as if some voice of God--

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.800 align:middle line:90%
it was a vibrational frequency.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't a
person saying it.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It was the vibrational
frequency that

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:43.000 align:middle line:84%
happens when you start
compressing the unified field.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:90%
Vibrations start to occur.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Sounds start to happen, which
is why these sacred texts say,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.900 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning,
there was the word, OK?

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a sound vibration.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And the word was
whatever the word was.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.710 align:middle line:90%
But it's a big word, OK?

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.980 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you're compressing
and compressing and compressing

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.000 align:middle line:90%
and coming here.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Your objective is to
get from here, boom,

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.060 align:middle line:90%
to come all the way here.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, here in
the physical dimension,

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.750 align:middle line:84%
seeking spirituality,
seeking that.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to find
it, because you're made of it.

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:14.620 align:middle line:90%
It's behind your eyes.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.360 align:middle line:90%
It's who you are already.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Your objective is to seek how
to become completely here.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you'll be free
and illuminate to this.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what happened
to me that day.

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:29.350 align:middle line:84%
I quickened for myself for the
first time in such a manner

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:90%
that it completed the job.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.760 align:middle line:90%
It got me here.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.080 align:middle line:10%
And boom, the energy,
which I'm going

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.880 align:middle line:10%
to share with you
how that works,

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:10%
the energy came together
in such a fashion

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:10%
that this rising energy which
I'm about to describe for you

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:10%
was able to rise
in such a fashion

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.180 align:middle line:10%
that my third eye could open.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.250 align:middle line:90%
The energy has to be stable.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Unless it's induced by a
drug or some external source,

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the body won't
allow your third eye

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to open until the foundation
underneath it is stable.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you can't
properly interpret

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.150 align:middle line:84%
what you're perceiving,
and it becomes a bad trip.

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
bad trips of the '60s

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.640 align:middle line:10%
came from with the
psychotropic drugs.

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.940 align:middle line:84%
It was because there were
not the circuits in place

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:24.440 align:middle line:84%
to integrate and to metabolize
what you were able to perceive.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.240 align:middle line:90%
It was too much.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.780 align:middle line:84%
It was overwhelming
to the system.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.197 align:middle line:84%
So people would
be writhing around

00:45:28.197 --> 00:45:30.512 align:middle line:84%
in so much pain or
freaked out, et cetera.

00:45:30.512 --> 00:45:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
to be that way.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:33.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's not
supposed to be that way.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.520 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to be living
culturally in such a fashion

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.120 align:middle line:84%
that we have the circuitry in
place to perceive ourselves

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.460 align:middle line:84%
as the multidimensional
being that we are.

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And let me explain that to you.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.083 align:middle line:84%
This is just what exists here
at the bottom of this, right?

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:50.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a blown up version of
it so you can see it better.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.200 align:middle line:90%
So you-- you--

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.490 align:middle line:90%
come here.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:56.710 align:middle line:90%
So this is you, the real you.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:84%
You're coming here
into this dimension.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So when people
say, when you keep

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:02.872 align:middle line:84%
walking around talking
about your higher self,

00:46:02.872 --> 00:46:05.080 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to be
your higher self if you keep

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.870 align:middle line:90%
talking about your higher self.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:07.833 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:09.000 align:middle line:90%
That's like, my name is Sue.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.375 align:middle line:84%
But if I say, you
know, I'm going

00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:13.840 align:middle line:90%
to go take Sue to lunch today--

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.550 align:middle line:90%
do you follow?

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:17.405 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let
Sue rest tonight.

00:46:17.405 --> 00:46:18.237 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:19.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, what about me?

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:19.390 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:20.190 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't leave you
out of the equation.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.740 align:middle line:84%
You are your higher--
be your higher

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:90%
self, for goodness sakes, OK?

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So in my coursework,
I walk you through how

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:32.500 align:middle line:84%
to do this more so
than I can possibly

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.020 align:middle line:84%
pack in to this
conversation, because today I

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:39.080 align:middle line:84%
want to take you straight into
some amazing conversation.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:39.910 align:middle line:90%
How do I start?

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:40.710 align:middle line:90%
How do I start?

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I want you to have a start with
this before we leave today.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.070 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to
get, this is you.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're coming down here to
have this physical experience.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.240 align:middle line:90%
This is the real you.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You're coming into this
world to have an experience.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You're made of wholeness.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And your job is to come in here
and remember that while you're

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.190 align:middle line:84%
here, because when you do,
you bring consciousness

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.030 align:middle line:90%
to this dimension.

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You bring the
consciousness of wholeness.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Unity consciousness is
wholeness consciousness.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.510 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.430 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to
connect with people

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.340 align:middle line:84%
from the splattered state
that we are and call

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.720 align:middle line:90%
it unity consciousness.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:16.790 align:middle line:10%
And we're all afraid because
when you're out here operat--

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.790 align:middle line:10%
remember the splat, where
the body goes one way,

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:20.890 align:middle line:10%
the mind goes one way, and
the breath goes another

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.130 align:middle line:10%
and we develop this personality,
this engaging self out here

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.330 align:middle line:10%
on the perimeter?

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.990 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
unity consciousness,

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:90%
yes, that's what I need.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.100 align:middle line:90%
I need to feel unified.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.517 align:middle line:84%
I need to feel
connected to others

00:47:31.517 --> 00:47:34.150 align:middle line:84%
because I feel so alone because
I'm attached to my mind,

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.500 align:middle line:90%
but never mind that.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.350 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow what I'm saying?

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So we, attached
to our minds, try

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to connect to other
people who are also

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:90%
attached to their minds.

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And we feel better
for a little bit.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:48.970 align:middle line:10%
But then underneath it,
there's this undertone of,

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.730 align:middle line:10%
(DEEPER TONE) I need something
from you in order to be whole.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So everything becomes a
(DEEPER TONE) bargaining

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and a maneuvering and
this kind of deal-striking

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.490 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have another
false sense of self,

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.380 align:middle line:84%
a false sense of wholeness,
a false sense of unity.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:10%
We have to come
home to ourselves

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.190 align:middle line:10%
and start operating
from this place of unity

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:10.990 align:middle line:10%
and then move into
our relationships

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.750 align:middle line:10%
from a position of sharing
rather than a position

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.560 align:middle line:10%
of bargaining if we ever want
to truly experience ourselves

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.760 align:middle line:10%
as this.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Got it?

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So first things
first, it doesn't

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%
mean that we're not
supposed to connect

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.330 align:middle line:90%
with people around the world.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.320 align:middle line:90%
You bet we do.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And doing that in the
meantime while we're

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.220 align:middle line:84%
learning how to
build the circuitry

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.400 align:middle line:84%
to perceive who we actually
are all at the same time

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.610 align:middle line:90%
is a groovy thing.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.740 align:middle line:90%
It's fine to do both.

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
accomplish one 100%

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.390 align:middle line:84%
before you get into working with
other people in this manner.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't want us to
leave out of the equation

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.850 align:middle line:84%
the importance of finding
your own wholeness ultimately

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.240 align:middle line:84%
as you're engaging with other
people for the purpose of unity

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.920 align:middle line:90%
consciousness around the planet.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.090 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Because it will not be
what you seek for it to be.

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.750 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be what you seek
for it to be until we become

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.880 align:middle line:84%
the very vibration
that we're seeking,

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.790 align:middle line:84%
until we become that which
we are looking for, OK?

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So let me just share that
that is you to drop into this.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that's
you now, coming here.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.930 align:middle line:84%
You drop in, and you
hit as the energy.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.260 align:middle line:10%
So formally, I would
have and have had

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:10%
this conversation like this.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.650 align:middle line:10%
Here's how I would have said it.

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Here you are.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.830 align:middle line:84%
An energy comes
down into your body.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And it hits the Earth.

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.387 align:middle line:84%
And it rises up
through your body.

00:49:29.387 --> 00:49:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And it comes out the
top of your head.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And it cycles around
the outside of you

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.380 align:middle line:84%
and recycles and
recycles and recycles.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And your objective is to
allow the pure energy that's

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:43.330 align:middle line:84%
coming into you to hit the Earth
and rise back up through you as

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.700 align:middle line:90%
purely as it descended down in.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.460 align:middle line:84%
You want it to rise up
through you without you

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.990 align:middle line:90%
messing with it, OK?

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.820 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.840 align:middle line:10%
When this energy
rises back up, if you

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:58.690 align:middle line:10%
don't have the
circuitry in place

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:03.550 align:middle line:10%
to allow it to rise
in its purest form,

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.450 align:middle line:10%
because it's moving up through
this filtering system which

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.390 align:middle line:10%
we call the chakra
system, if you

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:14.470 align:middle line:10%
don't have the energies of
your second chakra connected

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.570 align:middle line:10%
to the energies of
your third chakra,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.520 align:middle line:10%
then there is a problem there.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:21.400 align:middle line:84%
There's a lack of
communication between the two.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So that rising energy has
to go around the obstacles.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.330 align:middle line:90%
And hopefully you can see that.

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And as it goes around the gaps
where there is no circuitry,

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:90%
the energy picks up a wobble.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And as it picks up a wobble,
this energy field here,

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.420 align:middle line:84%
this toric field which
is a measurable thing--

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Institute of HeartMath
depicts this stronger one

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.210 align:middle line:84%
inside at the heart
center, as well--

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that this energy field
starts to become distorted.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you see how
that would happen?

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:53.330 align:middle line:90%
The wobble creates a distortion.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Now here you are,
conscious being,

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.690 align:middle line:84%
looking out through that
distorted energy field.

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And you see a distorted reality.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.420 align:middle line:84%
It's presenting back
to you a reflection

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
of your own
consciousness rising.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.240 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these chakras are
levels of consciousness.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.640 align:middle line:84%
They're ways of being able to
think and perceive and behave

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and exchange.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.980 align:middle line:90%
That's what they are.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:19.840 align:middle line:84%
That's how I'm using them
because, yes, they correlate

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.490 align:middle line:90%
to a part of your body, you bet.

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And they correlate to musical
notes and colors, you bet.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.120 align:middle line:90%
All of it is important.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And in this moment,
I'm just saying

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking to one aspect
of it, another aspect, which

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is that it's a level
of your consciousness

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:33.050 align:middle line:90%
that's being represented here.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:36.070 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have
your belongingness, which

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is your root chakra--
this is my gig.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:40.500 align:middle line:10%
I know that this is who I am.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.300 align:middle line:90%
This is my gig.

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming here to
have my experience.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm not here to fit
into your world.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:49.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm here creating and generating
a life experience of love

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.730 align:middle line:84%
for everyone involved,
that kind of thing, right?

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not in place,
then my second chakra

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.580 align:middle line:84%
is likely to have a wobble to
it, which is, how in the world

00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.760 align:middle line:84%
do I engage in relationship
with time or space or money

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.935 align:middle line:90%
or other people?

00:52:01.935 --> 00:52:03.310 align:middle line:84%
How do I have a
relationship that

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:06.220 align:middle line:84%
works if my root
isn't even working,

00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:90%
if I'm wobbly at that level?

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And then how do I
ever have a sense

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of who I really am as this
cosmic, universal being?

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.820 align:middle line:84%
How can I ever have
a perception of that

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:19.500 align:middle line:84%
when I'm obsessed with surviving
the bears that are in my life?

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.530 align:middle line:90%
You're tracking?

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.390 align:middle line:84%
Third chakra energy,
how do I ever

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.520 align:middle line:84%
get to unconditional
divine love when

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm freaking out all the time?

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.840 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to happen.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I love you,
only if you make

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.780 align:middle line:84%
me feel safe, only if you
behave a certain way so

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.280 align:middle line:90%
that I feel OK.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.120 align:middle line:90%
You get it?

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.660 align:middle line:84%
So one's a byproduct of
another of another of another.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.720 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that's how I used
to talk about the conversation,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.810 align:middle line:84%
that you have energy coming down
through your body, et cetera.

00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But what I really want to
get is just cut to the chase

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and say you are the energy
that is coming here.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:50.860 align:middle line:90%
You are the energy.

00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:52.507 align:middle line:90%
You are this.

00:52:52.507 --> 00:52:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You don't have it running
through your body.

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:58.270 align:middle line:84%
That's the world of separation
that starts the whole mess

00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:59.560 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in.

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.400 align:middle line:90%
We don't think that we are it.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.180 align:middle line:84%
We think we have it
or we're missing it

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:90%
or we're looking for it.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big,
fat waste of time.

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.280 align:middle line:90%
You following what I'm saying?

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.820 align:middle line:84%
You are that which you
have been seeking, OK?

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.160 align:middle line:90%
You're the spirit coming in.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You're landing in the
physical dimension.

00:53:16.210 --> 00:53:18.217 align:middle line:90%
And you're rising again.

00:53:18.217 --> 00:53:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Here's the beautiful part.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.540 align:middle line:84%
The degree of circuits that you
have in place will determine

00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:24.730 align:middle line:84%
the momentum-- remember
the garden hose--

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.790 align:middle line:84%
they will determine
the momentum that this

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:30.070 align:middle line:90%
rises with, the power.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:33.730 align:middle line:84%
And the higher this goes,
the bigger the toric field.

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you understand that?

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Can you get that?

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Our objective is to
learn how to awaken

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:44.170 align:middle line:84%
above our primitive brain,
because if we can awaken

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.630 align:middle line:84%
above our primitive
brain into the high brain

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:49.060 align:middle line:84%
centers where
creatorship lives, then

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.970 align:middle line:84%
we can operate as
creator in command

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:53.560 align:middle line:90%
of this physical dimension.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Does that track?

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:90%
So imagine it this way.

00:53:57.850 --> 00:53:58.720 align:middle line:90%
You come down.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
circuits in place.

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:03.910 align:middle line:84%
There's a subtle toric field
here, bigger than this one.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:05.740 align:middle line:90%
You get more circuitry in place.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.200 align:middle line:84%
The toric field gets
bigger until pretty soon

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.710 align:middle line:84%
your toric field is
incorporating your higher self.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:16.630 align:middle line:10%
Imagine how big your
toric field flow

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:21.220 align:middle line:10%
would be if you were in
the state of allowing

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:26.130 align:middle line:10%
these high frequency energies
to be part of the mix.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.020 align:middle line:90%
Capiche?

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:27.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:30.510 align:middle line:84%
So the Christ in consciousness,
the Buddha consciousness,

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.450 align:middle line:90%
they're right in here.

00:54:31.450 --> 00:54:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The ascended master
consciousness,

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:38.020 align:middle line:84%
the archangelic consciousness,
they're all right in here.

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So get that we have already
accessed the ability

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to be up in here.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.180 align:middle line:90%


00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And a few thousand
years ago, we were

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.270 align:middle line:90%
invited to do the same thing.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:51.070 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:51.580 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.788 align:middle line:90%
You can do all this and more.

00:54:52.788 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can be Buddha.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:55.882 align:middle line:84%
Do those words sound
familiar to you?

00:54:55.882 --> 00:54:57.340 align:middle line:84%
You bet they sound
familiar to you.

00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's an invitation that was
extended over 2,000 years ago.

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
warming up to the idea.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:04.960 align:middle line:84%
We're still, you know, (DEEPER
TONE) well, I don't know.

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Still separate.

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.610 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't think so.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.735 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I'm going to
accept that invitation--

00:55:08.735 --> 00:55:10.590 align:middle line:10%
because there's
something seated in us

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:16.050 align:middle line:10%
in very big ways that puts a
lot of fear into the mix, right?

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.380 align:middle line:10%
And that's inherited
into your own DNA

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.360 align:middle line:10%
because things were
shut down, et cetera.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's all perfect.

00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's by divine design
because you came here

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to awaken to yourself as
your magnificent creatorship

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.220 align:middle line:90%
that you are--

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.140 align:middle line:90%
creator, you follow?

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Creation, the action of
continually creating.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And those are the three
principles that the Vedic

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.180 align:middle line:90%
literature is all based on.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.670 align:middle line:84%
The whole Eastern culture
is about the observer,

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the observed, and the constant
action of observing, right?

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:48.360 align:middle line:84%
The creator, the creation, and
the constant recreation that's

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.950 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:50.790 align:middle line:90%
So it's right here.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:53.280 align:middle line:90%
It's right here in front of us.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And I bring this to you
from a place of experience

00:55:56.370 --> 00:56:00.990 align:middle line:84%
and from a place of humble
knowing that we bump up

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:03.120 align:middle line:84%
against our own
deep cellular memory

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and our deep cellular
belief systems

00:56:05.310 --> 00:56:07.140 align:middle line:84%
when we start speaking
about this stuff.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.045 align:middle line:90%
And we absolutely have to.

00:56:09.045 --> 00:56:10.470 align:middle line:90%
We have to.

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:12.630 align:middle line:90%
We have to allow it to be OK.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.060 align:middle line:10%
We have to allow it
to be the thing that

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:22.770 align:middle line:10%
is going to make us whole again,
allow us to be embodied fully

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.990 align:middle line:10%
as the spirit being energy.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.960 align:middle line:10%
You know, I can talk about
it as the highest frequency

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.150 align:middle line:10%
energy being, light being.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Or I can talk about
it in spiritual terms.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.310 align:middle line:84%
But the key is for us to
realize that we're all

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:36.750 align:middle line:90%
talking about the same thing.

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a stretch
for science, you bet.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:43.285 align:middle line:84%
Quantum science is a stretch
for spirituality because quantum

00:56:43.285 --> 00:56:45.660 align:middle line:84%
science is proving that we
cannot separate ourselves from

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:46.350 align:middle line:90%
God.

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.710 align:middle line:90%
You just can't.

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:52.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a place where you
just have to say, OK, got it.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm that.

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.950 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And that, I go into churches
and speak about this.

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
(HESITATINGLY) OK, got it, yeah.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you can bring the
evidence of the studies,

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.950 align:middle line:84%
at some point we have to say,
OK, I can be a part of that.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's about as
far as we can get.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.070 align:middle line:90%
And that's totally cool.

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:16.740 align:middle line:84%
That's all I'm inviting us to
do is just to allow yourselves

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:18.870 align:middle line:84%
to be a little bigger
than you thought you were,

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.760 align:middle line:84%
because you're not
this separate entity.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.070 align:middle line:90%
So everybody gets this?

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:25.320 align:middle line:90%
You are that which is rising.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And the key is, can
you allow the things

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.510 align:middle line:84%
in your life that
are causing friction

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:34.710 align:middle line:84%
to be how the guidance is
occurring for you to create

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:38.430 align:middle line:84%
the ability to rise
higher without splatting

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:41.430 align:middle line:84%
on the circumstances
of your daily life?

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.300 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.180 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Can you translate it that way?

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Or is the family situation
or the financial situation

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:53.130 align:middle line:84%
or the health considerations,
does it have a hold of you?

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Or are you using it
to your advantage?

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And the invitation is
obviously the latter.

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So I have this little
concept that I reference

00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:03.610 align:middle line:90%
as the bus stop conversation.

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.710 align:middle line:10%
And it's a soul
contracts kind of thing.

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
infuse it in here

00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.950 align:middle line:84%
because I get so much feedback
from people around the world

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:14.460 align:middle line:84%
all the time, emails
coming in, about how just

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:17.760 align:middle line:84%
understanding this perspective
changed their lives so

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760 align:middle line:90%
dramatically.

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.135 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
conceptual thing.

00:58:20.135 --> 00:58:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a conceptual release
of embracing everything

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.250 align:middle line:90%
that's happening in your life.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So in that, it has to do with
you going to the bus stop

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:30.890 align:middle line:84%
to catch the bus
to come to Earth.

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:32.830 align:middle line:84%
OK, you thought you got
here from the stork.

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.250 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:36.450 align:middle line:90%
But you didn't.

00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:38.533 align:middle line:90%
It was the bus.

00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:40.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you had the
little stork idea going

00:58:40.890 --> 00:58:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and it was really sweet,
I'm sorry to blow it.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.610 align:middle line:90%
You came here by a bus, OK?

00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:50.130 align:middle line:84%
So obviously it's
a symbolic analogy.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's about you
coming to the bus stop

00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and making arrangements
for the things

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.790 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to need to
experience while you're here

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:02.730 align:middle line:84%
on Earth in order to further
your own consciousness,

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:06.300 align:middle line:84%
in order for you to awaken
in the specific vibrational

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.840 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that you are
interested in animating.

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.135 align:middle line:90%
You're here to wake up courage.

00:59:11.135 --> 00:59:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Or you're here to wake up
the attributes of liberty

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:21.610 align:middle line:84%
or of unconditionality or your
own divinity or forgiveness,

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:22.470 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:25.170 align:middle line:10%
So an example, of
course, that I use often

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:27.810 align:middle line:10%
is you go to the bus stop.

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.850 align:middle line:84%
You say, you know, on
my way out last time--

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:33.910 align:middle line:84%
well, basically somebody
says, what are you here for?

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:36.210 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
in for, right?

00:59:36.210 --> 00:59:38.312 align:middle line:84%
And somebody at the bus
stop says, you know,

00:59:38.312 --> 00:59:39.270 align:middle line:90%
I've been there before.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:40.380 align:middle line:90%
It's really awesome.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And on my way out, just
at the last minute,

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I did this thing that
they call forgiveness.

00:59:44.940 --> 00:59:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And it really just felt so good.

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:49.530 align:middle line:84%
It was like, all of a sudden
I was free right there

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:50.560 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of it.

00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.110 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm going back.

00:59:52.110 --> 00:59:56.370 align:middle line:84%
And this time I'm going to
have a bigger shot of that.

00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm going in for a
level 10 of forgiveness.

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:02.197 align:middle line:84%
And so everybody else at the
bus stop is like, whoa, awesome.

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:03.530 align:middle line:90%
So how are you going to do that?

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.975 align:middle line:84%
And you basically
say, I don't know.

01:00:05.975 --> 01:00:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I guess somebody is going to
have to do something that's,

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.450 align:middle line:90%
like, nearly unforgivable.

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to live
with that as a separate self.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be burdened with
the weight of not forgiving

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.990 align:middle line:90%
them, the unforgiveness.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
affect my health.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:24.187 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to affect the joy
in my life and my relationships

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and my attitude, et cetera, so
long that I'm going to get down

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:31.810 align:middle line:84%
the road about 20 years or so,
and I'm going to be so tired

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and beat up for having lived
that way that I'm going to just

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.440 align:middle line:84%
reach inside myself and
find some part of myself

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
that I never knew existed
and pull it up and out

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:46.267 align:middle line:84%
and forgive this situation
because it's just not worth it.

01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's just not
worth the compromise

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
that it's creating in my life.

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:51.607 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I'm going to, boom,

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be liberated.

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:54.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have it my way.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%
All this energy is going
to rush into my system,

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:00.670 align:middle line:84%
because when we judge
something as wrong,

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
we draw density on
the energy field.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And we contract in a
way that's inappropriate

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.690 align:middle line:90%
for the vibrational bandwidth.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Each of these are different
vibrational frequencies.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to be
cultivating your ability

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
to perceive every one of these
frequencies and masterfully

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:17.410 align:middle line:90%
work with them.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:21.440 align:middle line:84%
But they are, as a default
mechanism until you wake up,

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
they're designed to operate as
a feedback mechanism for you.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
So there's great benefit,
and it's a fail-proof system.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:29.540 align:middle line:90%
It's going to work.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.935 align:middle line:84%
So either your physical
health is going to fail,

01:01:31.935 --> 01:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
your mental health and
well-being is going to fail,

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
your emotional health and
well-being is going to fail,

01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.270 align:middle line:90%
because of a lack of circuitry.

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So the circuitry I'm
speaking about here

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.270 align:middle line:84%
that has to be in place to
keep the wobble out of the mix

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is the same circuitry
that happens here.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
This is through circuitry that
we get all the way in, right?

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:51.550 align:middle line:84%
To stay conscious, we have to
have consciousness circuits.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So the circuits are both
electromagnetic energy,

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and then they become
neuro circuitry.

01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:57.948 align:middle line:90%
So they're quantum circuits.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they're neuro
circuits, all right?

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.840 align:middle line:90%
So I'll come back to that.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.572 align:middle line:84%
But recognize that this
is what's happening,

01:02:04.572 --> 01:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that the moment that
you decide something

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.700 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't have happened, you
draw a barrier between you

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.760 align:middle line:90%
and what you get to land.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.460 align:middle line:84%
So the rest of you
that's trying to come in

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
hits this density, this
gunk in the energy field.

01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.490 align:middle line:84%
That's my very sophisticated
terminology there.

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
It hits the gunk
in the energy field

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and bounces back onto itself.

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So these are parts of you,
certain vibrational frequencies

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of you, that can
never drop in here.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They start coming in, and
they just stay elevated.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.378 align:middle line:10%
They stay up and out
of your system here

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.170 align:middle line:10%
in the physical realm
because you don't yet

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.230 align:middle line:10%
have the circuits to
vibrate at resonance so

01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.050 align:middle line:10%
that you can come
in here and wake up

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:46.570 align:middle line:10%
to those aspects of life.

01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:47.612 align:middle line:90%
Are you tracking with me?

01:02:47.612 --> 01:02:48.412 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:02:48.412 --> 01:02:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm having a problem
with the block idea.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So we decide at some point
that something shouldn't be

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
the way--

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Shouldn't have happened.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.710 align:middle line:90%
>> --shouldn't have happened.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Boom.

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that blocks
things from then any time.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So now this energy
can't get through this

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:03.760 align:middle line:90%
because of a certain quality.

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.093 align:middle line:90%
They never should have fired me.

01:03:05.093 --> 01:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
That accident shouldn't
have happened, et cetera.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So at this state of at
the bus stop and I'm

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.100 align:middle line:84%
asking, what do you want to
have happen, what are you

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.260 align:middle line:84%
going in for, and you
say a level 20 or a level

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.293 align:middle line:84%
10 of forgiveness,
I'm going in for that,

01:03:19.293 --> 01:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and then they say,
OK, how are you

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
going to do that, somebody is
going to have to do something

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
nearly unforgivable.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.200 align:middle line:90%
So give us an example.

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So OK, somebody is going to have
to drink too much at happy hour

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:32.218 align:middle line:84%
and get behind the wheel and
come across the center line

01:03:32.218 --> 01:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and hit my car going
down the highway

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and take part of my family
and cripple me or something

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:37.180 align:middle line:90%
along these lines, OK?

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.200 align:middle line:90%
Could've been avoided.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I have every reason to be
devastated and completely angry

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.130 align:middle line:90%
and all this stuff.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.030 align:middle line:90%
It's valid.

01:03:43.030 --> 01:03:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's valid.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.140 align:middle line:84%
But if we can understand
that, as part of the bus stop,

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a level 10
forgiveness, then, jahh, OK.

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:52.990 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds
of circumstances

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:55.870 align:middle line:90%
that allow that to happen.

01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And we do have the choice
of awakening to the level 10

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
capacity for forgiveness so
that these types of things

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.290 align:middle line:84%
don't have to happen in
order to get us there.

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:07.090 align:middle line:90%
We can awaken.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:09.520 align:middle line:10%
And that's why we're
in this conversation,

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.100 align:middle line:10%
so that we can proactively
awaken to the things

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:16.000 align:middle line:10%
that we came here to awaken to
without having to live them out

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.360 align:middle line:10%
in the physical as the
demonstration of, boom,

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.283 align:middle line:10%
the bumper car effect
where you bump into this

01:04:21.283 --> 01:04:23.200 align:middle line:10%
and you bump into that
and you bump into this.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon you figure out,
OK, so I'm bumping into this

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.490 align:middle line:90%
and bumping into that.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Pretty soon you carve
your pathway out

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.817 align:middle line:90%
of a process of elimination.

01:04:30.817 --> 01:04:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And we would really
like consciousness

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
to take us there without having
to do all the bumper cars.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.740 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.102 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we have a trauma
or an experience happens,

01:04:38.102 --> 01:04:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and we create this blockage--

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.982 align:middle line:90%
>> --how do we--

01:04:42.982 --> 01:04:45.633 align:middle line:84%
is it through forgiveness that
we can loosen it up and get rid

01:04:45.633 --> 01:04:46.433 align:middle line:90%
of it?

01:04:46.433 --> 01:04:48.016 align:middle line:84%
Or how do we get rid
of that blockage?

01:04:48.016 --> 01:04:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, so lots of ways.

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.523 align:middle line:84%
We, of course, then want to know
how to get rid of the blockage.

01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:53.940 align:middle line:84%
But I first want
you to understand

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.180 align:middle line:84%
that the blockage is actually
due to a lack of circuitry.

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.320 align:middle line:84%
If I had the circuitry in place,
I wouldn't have the reactions

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that I do to the things
that happen in my life

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
because we're having this
illuminating conversation.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.040 align:middle line:10%
If you walk out of
here and you recognize

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.457 align:middle line:10%
that absolutely every single
thing that happens in my life

01:05:10.457 --> 01:05:13.080 align:middle line:10%
is in support of my own
awakening per my request

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:17.700 align:middle line:10%
at the bus stop, then we don't
draw our judgmental conclusions

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:20.577 align:middle line:10%
and shove these
things away or think

01:05:20.577 --> 01:05:21.660 align:middle line:10%
that they're bad or wrong.

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We're embracing them
and accepting them.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Oh, my god, this
is so awakening me.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
And if it keeps on happening,
then I'm attached to something.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supposed to let
go of that so that it

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't keep on happening.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'm supposed
to evolve myself.

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're
doing is building

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
more circuitry in place so
that we can perceive this

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
from a higher bird's
eye view perspective,

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.200 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of the bus stop itself.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.000 align:middle line:10%
And so--

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.410 align:middle line:10%
>> So the way to build some
of the circuitry is to figure

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.210 align:middle line:10%
out--

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I haven't even begun to tell
you how to build the circuitry

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:50.890 align:middle line:10%
yet, OK?

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.100 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be the
whole last hour of our time

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.540 align:middle line:90%
together, OK?

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.460 align:middle line:90%
So fret not.

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Like, (PANICKY)
wait, I don't want

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.577 align:middle line:84%
to miss how to
build the circuits!

01:05:57.577 --> 01:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let me catch this!

01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.310 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple ways
to build the circuits.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to teach you
a massive way to get--

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:08.087 align:middle line:84%
so this is a gap that collects
gunk because it's a gap.

01:06:08.087 --> 01:06:09.920 align:middle line:84%
There's no energy flowing
through that area.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.520 align:middle line:90%
It becomes, like, cesspooly.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it becomes a
magnetic attraction for you

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:17.790 align:middle line:84%
to attract other experiences
into your life that

01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
are of similar nature
until they build up so

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.618 align:middle line:90%
much you can't miss it, OK?

01:06:22.618 --> 01:06:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you're walking around
saying, (ANGRILY) why

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:26.210 align:middle line:90%
does this always happen to me?

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:32.430 align:middle line:10%
OK, if it's that,
there's some patterns

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:37.140 align:middle line:10%
of gunk on the field that are
a magnetic draw so that you can

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:42.000 align:middle line:10%
ultimately untangle this
idea and have energy flowing

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.540 align:middle line:10%
through your system the way
that it's designed to flow,

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:49.750 align:middle line:10%
because we're supposed to be
a transmuting machine here

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:50.550 align:middle line:10%
on Earth.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.140 align:middle line:90%
We are this.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
We come into this
physical dimension

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to the cutting edge
of consciousness.

01:06:56.490 --> 01:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're supposed to take the
chaos of dissonant energies

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and discordant energies and the
energies of dualistic thinking

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and the greed and the fight
and the battle and the war

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and all of this kind of
energy and turn it in,

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
metabolize it into
resonant energies,

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
because we're made of
wholeness, resonant energy.

01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of like this
tiller, like a garden tiller.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:24.600 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, churning up
and churning up the soil

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.740 align:middle line:84%
so that you can plant
a new seed in it.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
That's what we're doing here.

01:07:28.890 --> 01:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
This toric field is
constantly moving.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And the less gunk that's on the
field, the more efficient it

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.820 align:middle line:90%
moves, et cetera.

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.487 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to
learn some techniques

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
today that allow you to quicken
your energy, like putting

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
the thumb over the garden
hose to pick up the power,

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to pick up the
power of descension,

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.130 align:middle line:84%
descending yourself
as the highest

01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:49.860 align:middle line:84%
frequency available in
the third dimension.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
You're descending yourself
into the third dimension

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:55.890 align:middle line:84%
so that ascension
happens completely.

01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Think of it like this.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.910 align:middle line:84%
If you're hanging out
in the middle of a pool

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:04.170 align:middle line:84%
and you go halfway down or
closer toward the bottom

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and you hold your breath and
you're hanging out in the water

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you're almost out of
breath, to get to the surface,

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
it's easier if you drop down,
push off from the surface.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:15.210 align:middle line:10%
You get to the surface
faster than if you

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.835 align:middle line:10%
start trying to paddle your way
up to the surface of the water,

01:08:17.835 --> 01:08:19.460 align:middle line:10%
if you have something
to push off from.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
that, if you just

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
imagine that what
needs to happen

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
is we have to drop in here so
that we can rise with power,

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:29.550 align:middle line:90%
all right?

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:32.880 align:middle line:10%
So we have to come in
here, build the circuitry

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.770 align:middle line:10%
so that the momentum
that is rising

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:39.060 align:middle line:10%
is not distorted or thwarted by
this idea that you might have

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.340 align:middle line:10%
inherited or that you
developed early on in your life

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:44.290 align:middle line:10%
or that you came in to even
work on in the first place,

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:47.683 align:middle line:10%
an idea of insufficiency
or inadequacy in some way.

01:08:47.683 --> 01:08:48.850 align:middle line:90%
We have to get those things.

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.392 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
teach you some things

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:53.575 align:middle line:90%
rapid fire in our second hour.

01:08:53.575 --> 01:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
in about 10 minutes.

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.939 align:middle line:10%
And we're going to have lots of
time to get into two or three

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.029 align:middle line:10%
awesome practices that are
going to set you guys in motion

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:04.649 align:middle line:10%
with doing this, OK?

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So we get the big
picture here and here?

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.170 align:middle line:90%
All right?

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.210 align:middle line:90%
This is what's cooking.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:12.723 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to prefer the
terminology of toric field

01:09:12.723 --> 01:09:14.214 align:middle line:90%
instead of auric field.

01:09:14.214 --> 01:09:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you have any--

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.826 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry, the toric field?

01:09:16.826 --> 01:09:20.298 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to prefer the
terminology of toric field

01:09:20.298 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
instead of auric field.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Auric field, yeah.

01:09:23.109 --> 01:09:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it is the auric field.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.390 align:middle line:90%
It is the auric field.

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The question is, is it about the
toric field or the auric field?

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:35.522 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
the auric field.

01:09:35.522 --> 01:09:36.939 align:middle line:84%
These are all the
different-- when

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:39.279 align:middle line:84%
you take the aura
photographs out here,

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
they're photographing
the relationship

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
between these different
bandwidths of energy.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're showing
up as different colors

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and as the Kirlian photography,
the computerized photography

01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:53.649 align:middle line:84%
that gets to happen for us
through this technology.

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So the auric field is
this, and it is this.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So basically this is
a static snapshot.

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:01.900 align:middle line:84%
This is showing you
vibrational values.

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
This is a higher
vibration than this--

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.860 align:middle line:84%
higher, lesser, lesser, lesser,
denser, denser, grounded,

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.710 align:middle line:84%
grounded, grounded,
grounded, OK?

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's more heavier
anchoring qualities.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And so inside of each
of these bandwidths,

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.190 align:middle line:84%
there is also-- like
the outside edge of this

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:20.930 align:middle line:84%
has a higher frequency than
the inside edge of the red.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:21.730 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So you have higher frequency
thoughts and lower frequency

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.910 align:middle line:90%
thoughts.

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:27.280 align:middle line:84%
You have higher
frequency emotions,

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.340 align:middle line:84%
that's the blue bandwidth,
and lower frequency emotions.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And so this is how I started
speaking initially today.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I spoke about the
fact that we can't

01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
cut out half of our emotional
experience and call it bad.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:41.170 align:middle line:84%
We ultimately have to
embrace all of them.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.990 align:middle line:84%
If we ever want to get through
this emotional bandwidth

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
of energies all the way
to the physical-- so

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
it's spiritual, mental,
emotional, etheric,

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:51.603 align:middle line:84%
which is where the
chakra system resides.

01:10:51.603 --> 01:10:53.520 align:middle line:10%
It goes all the way
through to the other side.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And the chakras
are on top of that.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And the physical body
is on top of that.

01:10:57.970 --> 01:11:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So we want to come through
all these different bandwidths

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of energy without interruption
if we want to get here fully.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
But we get hung
up in the beliefs

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
reactions to those beliefs

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and the hesitancies
that we come across.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
So the whole idea is
I've got to get through.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.300 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get all
the way through.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Got to get all the way through.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.940 align:middle line:84%
So in that, if there are areas
that we don't have circuits

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.590 align:middle line:90%
in place, we get hung up there.

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And we keep recreating
those scenarios

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:26.650 align:middle line:84%
so that we can wake up to
what that one is trying

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.510 align:middle line:90%
to offer the whole system.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.160 align:middle line:90%
Does that makes sense?

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So then another
snapshot of this is--

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:38.050 align:middle line:84%
this outermost high frequency
energy here is this one.

01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The next one in is
the electric body that

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
moves inside of this whole.

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
This is considered
the ascension body.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And it's high frequency.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And we get into all this in my
coursework, level 1 and 2 and 3

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and 4, if you want to
take that coursework.

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:57.220 align:middle line:84%
The next one in is
chakra 10, which is here.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:00.260 align:middle line:84%
The next one in,
which is your legacy--

01:12:00.260 --> 01:12:01.060 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.080 align:middle line:84%
The next one up is
your soul purpose.

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And then the next one
in is your life purpose.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And then we come right
into the heart center.

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And then all of this blossoms
as a reflection of how

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:17.350 align:middle line:10%
the light of all of
consciousness or creation

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:19.000 align:middle line:10%
is anchored in the human heart.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we start unfolding
here in this dimension

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in the discovery of that.

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole
journey that I walk you

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
through in a fantastic
fashion that I absolutely

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.950 align:middle line:90%
love sharing with people.

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's the last 19 years
of my life experience

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and research and sharing
with other people

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that I'm teaching in the
energy codes coursework.

01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:44.350 align:middle line:10%
So this would be the
auric field, also, OK?

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're not leaving the
auric field out of it

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.010 align:middle line:84%
because that's who
you really are.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:51.490 align:middle line:84%
So this, when it
starts to imbue itself

01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:54.580 align:middle line:84%
into the physical dimension,
becomes first an aura.

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.710 align:middle line:10%
And then it quickens and
compresses and compresses

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:58.130 align:middle line:10%
to create physical form, OK?

01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:59.898 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically a similar
meaning, right?

01:12:59.898 --> 01:13:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's the same.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The auric field in motion
is the toric field flow.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, when it starts
moving and is in motion,

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:12.210 align:middle line:90%
it creates this torus, OK?

01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:13.060 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:13.970 align:middle line:90%
So how are we doing?

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Are we tracking?

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:15.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, good, good.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Questions?

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:17.460 align:middle line:84%
We're good, we're
good, we're good?

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.845 align:middle line:90%
OK, just big concept questions.

01:13:18.845 --> 01:13:19.645 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:23.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Just in terms of the light
coming in, how does that affect

01:13:23.695 --> 01:13:24.495 align:middle line:90%
babies?

01:13:24.495 --> 01:13:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of the light coming
in, how does it affect babies?

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.090 align:middle line:90%
>> In the womb?

01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:32.485 align:middle line:84%
>> In the womb and
as they're alive.

01:13:32.485 --> 01:13:35.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the light coming
in is the baby coming in.

01:13:35.492 --> 01:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't have an
effect on the baby.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.970 align:middle line:90%
It is the baby, OK?

01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So we are here developing
our own circuitry inside

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
of the energy field
of the mother.

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So if the energy
field of the mother

01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
has these distortions in it,
then we land here on purpose.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.840 align:middle line:84%
We are the electromagnetic
match for that.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.440 align:middle line:84%
That mother is providing the
perfect environment for you

01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to land and to work out what
you came here to work out.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
So when people
feel like, I don't

01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
know how I landed in
the family I landed in--

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:05.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.820 align:middle line:84%
--or what is going on, I must
have read the roadmap wrong,

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.980 align:middle line:84%
ah, I don't even know if
I'm on the right planet

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
for sure, those kinds of
feelings are valuable,

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:16.590 align:middle line:90%
valid feelings.

01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But they're only you
thinking from the splat.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not you thinking from
the place that I'm describing

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging you to return
to because when you return

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
to this, you totally get
why, exactly why, you

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:32.730 align:middle line:90%
landed where you landed.

01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And how to bring your
authenticity forward

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
in those circumstances is
the point of you being here.

01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:40.830 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly why, OK?

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:41.940 align:middle line:90%
So how are we doing?

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Ready to keep rolling?

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:43.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.750 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so there are a few things
that I want to share with you,

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:52.080 align:middle line:10%
first of all, that are very
simple for you to do to start

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.950 align:middle line:10%
to quicken the energy so that
you can pick up the power

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.510 align:middle line:10%
of the toric field.

01:14:57.510 --> 01:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And please bear in mind that
in the actual coursework that I

01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
teach, there are many,
many more techniques

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
than I will be able to
share with you today.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:10.200 align:middle line:10%
This is like a brief, like, "hi,
how are you doing; oh, my gosh,

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.460 align:middle line:10%
let me share this with
you" kind of moment.

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:16.380 align:middle line:10%
And so I do want you to be able
to leave with some things that

01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:20.100 align:middle line:10%
are going to change your
world if you utilize them.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.580 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, I do want
to invite you into a bigger

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.830 align:middle line:10%
study if you are interested.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.590 align:middle line:10%
It goes very far and
very deep and very wide

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:31.350 align:middle line:10%
and reaches very high if
you are interested in that.

01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:33.960 align:middle line:10%
I take sacred journeys
around the world.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.210 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to go on those
to learn the coursework.

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:39.840 align:middle line:10%
I teach the coursework right
here in LA and in Denver

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.820 align:middle line:10%
and across the country.

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:47.580 align:middle line:10%
I go into Phoenix and into
Texas and onto the East Coast,

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.430 align:middle line:10%
as well.

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.400 align:middle line:10%
So just keep in
mind that there are

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.130 align:middle line:10%
answers here abound for you.

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:55.610 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I'm on the
planet, is to share that.

01:15:55.610 --> 01:16:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin with
you recognizing

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.880 align:middle line:84%
the difference of
how it feels to be

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.970 align:middle line:84%
in the splat versus
calling yourself

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and quickening yourself
back into the core.

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.320 align:middle line:10%
So first of all, I'm
just going to invite

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.020 align:middle line:10%
you to throw your energy
off of you and either

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:20.760 align:middle line:10%
onto me or onto some object
in the room in front of you

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:23.700 align:middle line:10%
to just disempower
yourself, empty yourself

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:25.500 align:middle line:10%
the way that you
would if somebody

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:29.220 align:middle line:10%
that upset you came into the
room and all of your energy

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.110 align:middle line:10%
would go, rah, rush.

01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:32.520 align:middle line:90%
You don't do it on purpose.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's like they just
take your energy because

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
of a past association in your
subconscious that's stored.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And its gunk right here.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And they activate the gunk, so
it pulls you off of you and out

01:16:45.150 --> 01:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
into the mental body,
into story land,

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.910 align:middle line:84%
into the world where we write
stories and assign values

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and judgments onto things.

01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So throw it off of you.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:57.750 align:middle line:84%
Notice how it feels in
your body when you do that.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Now call it all back home.

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Claim it right
back onto yourself.

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Just quicken it right
back into your core.

01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.330 align:middle line:90%
Just have it.

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Claim it, just the
basic, raw energy.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Just pull the energy
back onto you.

01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And notice how it
feels in your body.

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel a
different feeling there.

01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Now throw it off of you again.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Just disperse it.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, this usually doesn't
happen purposefully.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.140 align:middle line:84%
This usually happens because
somebody comes in that taps

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.780 align:middle line:84%
some subconscious
memory of a bear

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:30.990 align:middle line:84%
and pulls you right back
into the memory storage

01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
in the field, which is
what we were speaking

01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
about on the panel
about how the bio

01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
field and the mind and the
memory are not in the brain.

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:37.685 align:middle line:90%
They're in the field.

01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:38.760 align:middle line:90%
It pulls you off.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So you think about the
disempowering situation--

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.830 align:middle line:84%
throw it off into an
old story, something

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you wish hadn't
happened, et cetera.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And notice how you
feel in your body.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:49.230 align:middle line:90%
And it does not feel the same.

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Pull it back into
your home base.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Just claim it right back onto
this central point of focus

01:17:55.050 --> 01:17:55.920 align:middle line:90%
that is you.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:56.995 align:middle line:90%
Call it home.

01:17:56.995 --> 01:17:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
notice in your body

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.370 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
different feeling.

01:18:00.370 --> 01:18:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel the difference?

01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Just give me a little hand
or a nod or something there.

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:05.940 align:middle line:90%
OK, awesome.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I want you to do is
that about 1,000 times a day

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.020 align:middle line:84%
until you have a
distinction going, like, oh.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
count 1,000, right?

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Just every spare moment,
just call it onto subject.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.550 align:middle line:90%
This is me, subject.

01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Or you throw it off of you onto
some object, another person,

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.260 align:middle line:90%
an object of your focus.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.950 align:middle line:10%
And then claim it back onto
subject, back onto you.

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And just start to familiarize
your subconscious memory

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
with the distinction
between the two,

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
because once it starts to
build these awarenesses

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:44.090 align:middle line:90%
on a basic, raw energy level--

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is what the
energy codes are all about.

01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I want you to get.

01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:50.590 align:middle line:84%
The energy codes are about
not trying to process life

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:52.270 align:middle line:90%
from the level of your mind.

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:53.830 align:middle line:90%
This is the mental body.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.288 align:middle line:84%
People try to, like, I know
this is happening for a reason.

01:18:56.288 --> 01:18:58.288 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just try to
find the blessing in it

01:18:58.288 --> 01:18:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and just keep going.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.683 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have we said that?

01:19:00.683 --> 01:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I know I need to get out of
my head and get into my heart.

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:04.660 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have you said that?

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I can't
let go of this thing.

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It just seems to be
haunting me no matter what.

01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:09.400 align:middle line:84%
How many times
have you said that?

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.500 align:middle line:84%
All of that is because
we're attached to the mind,

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.410 align:middle line:84%
living as the mind, trying to
do all the work of solution

01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:15.400 align:middle line:90%
from the mind.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And the mind is not the answer.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The mind is, at the most,
only one third of the answer.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:26.045 align:middle line:84%
So we want mind, body,
breath working together.

01:19:26.045 --> 01:19:26.920 align:middle line:90%
Think of it this way.

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.870 align:middle line:90%
The soul speaks to the body.

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And the body speaks to the mind.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
The essential self
speaks to the body.

01:19:33.130 --> 01:19:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And the body emanates
that out to the mind.

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.772 align:middle line:84%
And the mind is supposed to
pick up on that and serve it.

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Einstein says we were
given this beautiful gift

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
of the intuitive
and a rational mind

01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
to act as its loyal servant.

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've created a culture
that honors the servant instead

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:48.430 align:middle line:90%
of the gift, OK?

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
talking about.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I would say is
that quantum science is now

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.450 align:middle line:84%
saying that we weren't given
the gift of the intuitive.

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I would say we are the
gift of the intuitive.

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And we have cultivated
the rational mind

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.110 align:middle line:90%
to act as our loyal servant.

01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And we have created a culture
that honors the mind instead

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:10.450 align:middle line:90%
of the self, you got it?

01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:11.290 align:middle line:90%
The story.

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So the mind writes stories
to complete itself.

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
It writes stories to give
itself something to tether to.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.730 align:middle line:84%
So here's you,
trying to come in.

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:20.500 align:middle line:84%
You get stuck at the
level of the mind.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.560 align:middle line:10%
The very best thing you can
do is create an attitude,

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:26.680 align:middle line:10%
write a story, have
a grudge, be upset,

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.650 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of charge
at that energy level

01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:33.062 align:middle line:10%
because it keeps you tethered
close to the neighborhood

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.270 align:middle line:10%
that you're trying to get to.

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself
like a helium balloon,

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to
get anchored here.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.640 align:middle line:90%
So you get to the mental body.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.220 align:middle line:90%
You start writing some stories.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%
You start having some reactions.

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And you decide they're wrong.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:46.782 align:middle line:84%
And then you carry this
grudge because the grudge

01:20:46.782 --> 01:20:48.252 align:middle line:90%
is a heavier energy--

01:20:48.252 --> 01:20:49.710 align:middle line:84%
you following what
I'm saying here?

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:51.320 align:middle line:90%
It anchors you.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And the anchoring
is good, except that

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.120 align:middle line:84%
while it keeps you anchored,
eventually it creates a box.

01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:58.990 align:middle line:84%
You got a lot of gunk on
this, a lot more gunk on here.

01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:00.100 align:middle line:90%
Pretty soon it's the box.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.820 align:middle line:90%
That box is the ego.

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:02.710 align:middle line:90%
It's the pain body.

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:04.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the protective personality.

01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I call it the
protective personality

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:07.838 align:middle line:84%
because people don't
like to have an ego.

01:21:07.838 --> 01:21:10.005 align:middle line:84%
But they don't mind having
a protective personality.

01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:12.220 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So we get a lot
of good work done that way.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:13.498 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, only the ego
doesn't want to have an ego.

01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:17.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're kind of duped anyway
if we do it that way, right?

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to just start to
approach this from an entirely

01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:24.147 align:middle line:90%
different perspective.

01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm all about teaching you
how to work from the raw energy

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.240 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.198 align:middle line:90%
You're an energy being.

01:21:29.198 --> 01:21:30.960 align:middle line:90%
You're not a story being.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.480 align:middle line:90%
You're not an attitude being.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.390 align:middle line:90%
You're not a grudge being only.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:35.270 align:middle line:90%
It's only one energy.

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.070 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:37.250 align:middle line:90%
You're much more than that.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So we want to work with the raw
energy underneath the story.

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And the body is constantly
reflecting that to you.

01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going to show you
some things with this, OK?

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So first we have to practice
subject, object, subject.

01:21:48.190 --> 01:21:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Subject, object, subject.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Collected, dispersed, collected.

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Got that?

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.670 align:middle line:90%
You can do that.

01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Please do it a bunch
of times because we

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:59.360 align:middle line:84%
have to record in
the memory that there

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360 align:middle line:84%
is another way of being,
that I'm a choice here.

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.710 align:middle line:90%
There's an option for me.

01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not stuck out
here in the story.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I can choose just to
come back onto myself.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that you
do, your attitude changes.

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to add
something to that, OK?

01:22:12.490 --> 01:22:14.200 align:middle line:84%
What we first want--
and I think that you

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.377 align:middle line:90%
have this in your worksheet.

01:22:16.377 --> 01:22:20.120 align:middle line:90%


01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:23.810 align:middle line:84%
We have these four
anchor points right here

01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:26.395 align:middle line:84%
that are showing up on
your worksheet, all right?

01:22:26.395 --> 01:22:28.520 align:middle line:84%
These four anchor points--
and here's the side view

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.480 align:middle line:90%
of the spine--

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:33.860 align:middle line:84%
these are related to the
Bhandas in Eastern culture.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:38.750 align:middle line:10%
And there's other stuff added
on to that for our purposes.

01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:41.720 align:middle line:10%
But basically what we're
doing is anchoring ourselves

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.170 align:middle line:10%
in the core of our being so
that when we come onto subject,

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:47.900 align:middle line:10%
we can stay there more
easily, all right?

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So we have to build
new circuitry.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to build a
new sense of self.

01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to build a
new perspective so

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:57.230 align:middle line:90%
that we can free up our minds.

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:59.990 align:middle line:84%
Right now your mind is
holding onto the grudges

01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:02.600 align:middle line:84%
that it's holding onto,
the grievances, the guilt,

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
the shame, the upsets, that
it is holding onto because you

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.910 align:middle line:90%
are a big being.

01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:10.400 align:middle line:10%
You're a big helium balloon, OK?

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.930 align:middle line:10%
You're high frequency energy.

01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.820 align:middle line:10%
And you're trying to
get into the density

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.710 align:middle line:10%
of the physical dimension.

01:23:15.710 --> 01:23:18.200 align:middle line:84%
It's like a scuba diver has
to put weights on in order

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.097 align:middle line:90%
to get down in the water, OK?

01:23:20.097 --> 01:23:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just like that.

01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So we hold on to
this density in order

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to keep us closer to
this physical realm,

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%
this physical world.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't let
go of our grudges

01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.980 align:middle line:84%
because we won't know
who we are if we do.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.660 align:middle line:90%
We'll float away, right?

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.910 align:middle line:10%
So we have to go
further than story

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:39.860 align:middle line:10%
and anchor all the
way at the core

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.320 align:middle line:10%
if we want to not need
the story anymore.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
If we want to not need
the guilt or the shame,

01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, as an
entity unto itself,

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
then I have to anchor
myself in the physical body

01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
because your physical body
is the Earth version of you.

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If you want to come all
the way here to Earth,

01:23:58.550 --> 01:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
you have to come all
the way into the body.

01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you're going
to find that you are not.

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:04.948 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
four anchor points.

01:24:04.948 --> 01:24:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to teach you
how to do it right now.

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:08.698 align:middle line:84%
First, we're going to
squeeze the muscles

01:24:08.698 --> 01:24:10.400 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the pelvic bowl.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.384 align:middle line:84%
So ladies, it's kind of
like a Kegel exercise.

01:24:12.384 --> 01:24:14.926 align:middle line:84%
Gentlemen, you're about to learn
what a Kegel exercise is all

01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:15.726 align:middle line:90%
about.

01:24:15.726 --> 01:24:17.270 align:middle line:84%
All right, so it's
basically if you

01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
were going to the
bathroom-- here's

01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
another way of approaching it.

01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:20.865 align:middle line:84%
If you were going
to the bathroom

01:24:20.865 --> 01:24:23.670 align:middle line:84%
and you had to stop the stream
instantly, like right now,

01:24:23.670 --> 01:24:25.145 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to
squeeze those muscles

01:24:25.145 --> 01:24:26.270 align:middle line:90%
with everything you've got.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.880 align:middle line:84%
You have to squeeze them
to stop that stream.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.670 align:middle line:84%
So those muscles are in the
area of exactly what we're

01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:32.670 align:middle line:90%
speaking about, OK?

01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:33.470 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:34.910 align:middle line:90%
But you got to squeeze them.

01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:36.993 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze them with everything
you've got right now.

01:24:36.993 --> 01:24:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And then relax it by 1/2.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.090 align:middle line:84%
When you relax it
by 1/2, now you

01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:43.620 align:middle line:84%
can start to do the work
that I'm speaking about.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So you can squeeze
that, and it's just

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:46.610 align:middle line:90%
a matter of remembering.

01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you come on to subject,
squeeze Mula Bhanda, OK?

01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Now go off of subject
onto object and relax it.

01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:59.050 align:middle line:84%
All right, then to help you come
back onto subject, squeeze it.

01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:01.787 align:middle line:84%
And gather all your energy back
into the core of your body.

01:25:01.787 --> 01:25:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to add
three more points

01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.110 align:middle line:84%
on top of that that
are going to help

01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
you start to stream this energy
without as much of a wobble.

01:25:11.650 --> 01:25:13.150 align:middle line:10%
So the next thing
you're going to do

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:15.903 align:middle line:10%
is squeeze your heart in
the center of your chest.

01:25:15.903 --> 01:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
squeeze your heart

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
as if you were doing a push up
or as if you were doing a bench

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.690 align:middle line:90%
press laying on a bench.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You contract your
pectoralis muscles.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Pull your shoulder blades
together and down, OK?

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Right there, boom.

01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Now go inside, like
the rings of a tree.

01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:33.160 align:middle line:90%
Go inside from there.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to come
into the central heart area

01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
where the heart chakra
is, not the heart

01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:44.120 align:middle line:90%
muscle off to the side.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's squeeze the heart.

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like hugging yourself
deep inside the chest.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
If it seems not
doable, it's just

01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:53.800 align:middle line:84%
because you've not been living
in there as much as you could.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And so you're not having the
dexterity and the musculature

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that you will after you
begin to do this for a while.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you sat down
and tried to play the piano,

01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:03.520 align:middle line:84%
you can't make your fingers
do that or ride a bicycle

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.260 align:middle line:90%
until you get used to doing it.

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.800 align:middle line:90%
So you just keep doing that.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
The next one is to constrict
the muscles in your throat,

01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:10.970 align:middle line:90%
like Darth Vader breathing.

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like Ujjayi
breathing in yoga

01:26:12.730 --> 01:26:15.650 align:middle line:90%
if you're familiar with that.

01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:18.280 align:middle line:10%
And what we want to
do is breathe such

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.060 align:middle line:10%
that you can hear your breath.

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So for just a moment,
breathe like Darth Vader.

01:26:22.690 --> 01:26:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And breathe in and out
through your nose always, OK?

01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's like your
Darth Vader breath.

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:27.060 align:middle line:90%
All right, so--

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:31.087 align:middle line:90%
[LOUDLY INHALING, EXHALING]

01:26:31.087 --> 01:26:32.120 align:middle line:90%


01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.150 align:middle line:90%
It's that kind of a breath, OK?

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:35.875 align:middle line:84%
It's going to sound
like a snorkel,

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:37.500 align:middle line:84%
like you're snorkeling
or scuba diving.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.442 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of
a sound, as well.

01:26:39.442 --> 01:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is that
you want your consciousness

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to be able to find you
in the central channel.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:47.162 align:middle line:84%
That's what Ujjayi
breathing is about in yoga.

01:26:47.162 --> 01:26:48.620 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
byproducts of that.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's to anchor the consciousness
in the central seat

01:26:51.530 --> 01:26:53.870 align:middle line:84%
of the body, in the central
channel of the body.

01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:57.840 align:middle line:84%
So it also is important
that you belly breathe.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So we want to breathe
in with the belly.

01:26:59.630 --> 01:27:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And exhale, pull the
belly back to the spine.

01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.870 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:04.310 align:middle line:90%
Inhale with your belly.

01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And exhale, pull your
belly back to your spine.

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So I want everybody to
take a deep breath in right

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.930 align:middle line:84%
now with your belly, not the
upper lobes of your lungs.

01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
see if everybody

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is doing this right, because
if I send you home breathing

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
like you think you're supposed
to be breathing and you're not,

01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:20.252 align:middle line:84%
you're actually doing exactly
the opposite of what you're

01:27:20.252 --> 01:27:21.210 align:middle line:90%
attempting to do there.

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:23.630 align:middle line:90%
So take a deep breath in.

01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:25.530 align:middle line:90%
No shoulder movement.

01:27:25.530 --> 01:27:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Exhale.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see your chest
move at all. (DEEPER TONE)

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:29.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to see
your chest move.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:31.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, drop and give me 20.

01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.530 align:middle line:90%
All right, so you got this?

01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.458 align:middle line:84%
So you're breathing
from the diaphragm down.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you were
sitting up at a table

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and you were
breathing and no one

01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:41.030 align:middle line:84%
could see your chest
moving at all, OK?

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
So breathing below right
here, below in the diaphragm.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Big inhale, big belly.

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.410 align:middle line:84%
You have permission for a big,
fat Buddha belly right now.

01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:51.460 align:middle line:90%
Come over the top of your pants.

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:52.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
We have a culture
that is just duping us

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.580 align:middle line:90%
in this way in a big way.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.290 align:middle line:84%
We suck in our gut, and
we puff up our chest.

01:27:58.290 --> 01:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Exhale, pull your navel
back to the spine.

01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:02.600 align:middle line:90%
Inhale, big belly.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Just want to make sure no
shoulders are duping you.

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:09.040 align:middle line:90%
OK, exhale.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.840 align:middle line:90%
One more time.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And can you just unhook
your hands for a second.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Just unhook your
hands, and let's see.

01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Inhale again.

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:17.010 align:middle line:90%


01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Big inhale.

01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Excellent, excellent.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

01:28:21.490 --> 01:28:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Can you feel the difference?

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.010 align:middle line:90%
Now take a chest breath.

01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:25.360 align:middle line:90%
Big chest breath.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.750 align:middle line:84%
[DEEPLY INHALES]
Feel the difference?

01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:31.455 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, you actually
elicit fight or flight

01:28:31.455 --> 01:28:33.580 align:middle line:84%
in your body, when you
breathe into the upper lobes

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:34.505 align:middle line:90%
of the lungs first.

01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:36.880 align:middle line:84%
When you breathe into the
lower lobes of the lungs first,

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
you activate the
parasympathetic nervous system,

01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:40.420 align:middle line:90%
which calms you down.

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
So you want to belly
breathe, belly breathe.

more vascularity

01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in the lower lobes of the lungs
for the parasympathetic nervous

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.210 align:middle line:84%
system and to oxygenate
the blood, both of which

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:51.280 align:middle line:84%
signal to the brain,
cool to chill out.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:52.160 align:middle line:90%
Cool, you're relaxed.

So when somebody says
take a big breath

01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:58.982 align:middle line:84%
before you go in that
meeting or before you

01:28:58.982 --> 01:29:01.105 align:middle line:84%
make that phone call,
if you go like this,

01:29:01.105 --> 01:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
you're basically telling
your nervous system,

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, we're going into a
den of bears, all right?

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.965 align:middle line:90%
[GROWLS] OK, here we go.

01:29:06.965 --> 01:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you're, of course,
going to automatically perceive

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:11.720 align:middle line:84%
everything from a place of
defensiveness, of guardedness,

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.520 align:middle line:90%
of protectiveness.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.687 align:middle line:90%
And it's just not necessary.

01:29:13.687 --> 01:29:15.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not what we're
supposed to be doing.

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:16.810 align:middle line:90%
All right, got it?

01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
So the next thing
is number four.

01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to come back and
review the first couple again

01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:22.623 align:middle line:90%
because they're the trickiest.

01:29:22.623 --> 01:29:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So we have this
constricted throat

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:25.415 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
hear your breath.

01:29:25.415 --> 01:29:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is you want
to find the central core

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.107 align:middle line:90%
channel of your body, OK?

01:29:30.107 --> 01:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
These are your
marching orders, folks.

01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:33.107 align:middle line:84%
You leave here
today, you're going

01:29:33.107 --> 01:29:36.010 align:middle line:84%
to find your central
channel, do or die.

01:29:36.010 --> 01:29:36.895 align:middle line:90%
That's it, OK?

01:29:36.895 --> 01:29:38.020 align:middle line:90%
That's what you have to do.

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is no
dying, by the way, OK?

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.670 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're afraid of
death is because it's a lie.

01:29:42.670 --> 01:29:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest limiting belief
in the world is that we die

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and that we can die.

01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And the one that predisposes
us to that limiting belief

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:55.510 align:middle line:90%
is the idea that we were born.

01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And it just becomes
really tricky, OK?

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.530 align:middle line:90%
You're an eternal being.

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
You've always been,
and you will always be.

01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And right now, you're in
here having this experience.

01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:06.708 align:middle line:84%
And if you knew that to the
core, you would be less afraid.

01:30:06.708 --> 01:30:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And you would be living
as freely as you're

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.957 align:middle line:90%
designed to be living here.

01:30:09.957 --> 01:30:11.290 align:middle line:90%
You're creating this experience.

01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're not enjoying it at
all, and you're supposed to be,

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:14.920 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're building the
circuits to make that easier.

01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:21.203 align:middle line:84%
All right, so the idea
is to come in here

01:30:21.203 --> 01:30:22.120 align:middle line:90%
where this is intense.

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give you a tiny
bit of science here just

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.460 align:middle line:90%
to kind of land that for you.

01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:29.320 align:middle line:84%
You know that quantum
science is showing us

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that the tiniest relationship
between the spectrum

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:38.200 align:middle line:84%
on physical matter to energy
is the photon-electron

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.910 align:middle line:84%
relationship,
right in there, OK?

01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:43.773 align:middle line:84%
So photons have an
effect on electrons.

01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And electrons are
part of an atom.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And the atom is part
of the molecule.

01:30:47.050 --> 01:30:48.937 align:middle line:84%
And the molecule's
part of the cell, which

01:30:48.937 --> 01:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
is part of the tissue,
which is part of the organ,

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and the gland, and
the whole system.

01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:53.320 align:middle line:90%
You got that?

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps
going from there.

01:30:56.140 --> 01:31:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And photons are influence-able
by your own thought, OK?

01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:05.140 align:middle line:84%
So you affect photons
by how you focus.

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:08.900 align:middle line:84%
You've been focusing your
senses to the external world.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the photon
density in here,

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:15.850 align:middle line:84%
the conscious photon density
in the core of your body,

01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:17.530 align:middle line:90%
is nix, OK?

01:31:17.530 --> 01:31:19.340 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty low.

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do is
increase photon density

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
at the core because it begins
to have an effect on electrons,

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately then would
have an effect on enough mass

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that your sensory nervous
system can pick up

01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:34.180 align:middle line:84%
on the sense of
something in there.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Instead of feeling empty
and hollow and void,

01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:41.650 align:middle line:84%
you start to feel a sense of
self, a sense of presence that

01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:45.530 align:middle line:84%
is unwavering and unwobbling
and available unconditionally

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
to you.

01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So the whole key
is you want to know

01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:50.560 align:middle line:84%
who you are, regardless of
your external circumstances,

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:52.050 align:middle line:84%
managing this
internal environment.

01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:53.800 align:middle line:84%
But you can't just use
your mind to do it.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Your mind alone is
not built for that.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's the shortcoming of
the whole conscious movement

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
in our culture, is
that we're trying

01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:04.150 align:middle line:84%
to use our minds to do
something that it alone

01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:05.560 align:middle line:90%
is not built to do.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
When it's connected to the body,
the mind changes completely.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Yogis and meditators and
sages and the ancients

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:18.160 align:middle line:84%
would sit on their heel in
Lotus Pose or in other positions

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.990 align:middle line:84%
so that they were
constantly applying

01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:22.480 align:middle line:84%
pressure right in
this Root Lock area,

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.460 align:middle line:84%
this Mula Bhanda
that I was saying

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:26.700 align:middle line:84%
was like a Kegel
exercise and so forth,

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.500 align:middle line:84%
this squeezing of those muscles
at the base of the pelvic bowl

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.320 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
stay in their body

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and expand their
consciousness instead of

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
taking their consciousness
and disembodying

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and having these
out-of-body experiences that

01:32:39.010 --> 01:32:40.642 align:middle line:90%
will not change your life.

01:32:40.642 --> 01:32:42.100 align:middle line:84%
They just frustrate
you because you

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.550 align:middle line:84%
have this experience of a
high frequency, amazing place,

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:47.950 align:middle line:84%
and it's not here
when you come back.

01:32:47.950 --> 01:32:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But if you stay here and
expand your consciousness

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:53.170 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, you are
anchoring and tethering

01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and able to integrate what
you're perceiving there.

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:56.150 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

01:32:56.150 --> 01:33:01.630 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing this for
about 20 years in regularity,

01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:04.000 align:middle line:84%
having access to these
higher dimensions

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.330 align:middle line:84%
and changing, healing a
scoliosis in my body--

01:33:07.330 --> 01:33:09.670 align:middle line:84%
a scoliosis-- and healing
migraine headaches

01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.220 align:middle line:84%
with exactly these concepts
and these practices

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.620 align:middle line:84%
that I'm starting to
share with you, OK?

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.430 align:middle line:84%
So not only that, I
am able to interpret

01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:22.070 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of information that
is considered cosmic information

01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:24.760 align:middle line:84%
or that is considered
sacred information or that

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.860 align:middle line:84%
is considered
ancient information.

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:29.020 align:middle line:84%
When I go to Egypt,
I'm able to perceive

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:30.970 align:middle line:84%
what's going on with
the hieroglyphs in ways

01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:34.960 align:middle line:84%
that even the most respected
Egyptologists who are our tour

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:39.280 align:middle line:84%
guide-- and the governor of
Luxor having dinner with us

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.080 align:middle line:84%
and being in an
exchange about what

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.600 align:middle line:84%
is happening here in
the communication,

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
endorsing what
I'm talking about.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.860 align:middle line:90%
There is something here.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And it is tapping the ancient
wisdom that every one of us

01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:52.250 align:middle line:90%
is made of.

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:54.080 align:middle line:90%
It's tapping your origins.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's much more expansive
than just learning how to let go

01:33:58.180 --> 01:34:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of that person at work
who's bothering you so much

01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that you get neck pain
every time you go to work.

01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:03.940 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot more
to you than that.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know
that because that's

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:09.910 align:middle line:90%
why we're gathered here.

01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to know that it's
all part of the same picture.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's all you.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So in this, we have
this ability to anchor

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.160 align:middle line:90%
at Mula Bhanda, this Root Lock.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Anchor at your heart.

01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a Kegel
exercise at Mula Bhanda.

01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It's lifting the muscles
of the pelvic bowl.

01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:36.393 align:middle line:84%
It's squeezing the
musculature that, if you

01:34:36.393 --> 01:34:37.810 align:middle line:84%
were going to the
bathroom and had

01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:39.460 align:middle line:84%
to stop the stream
in an instant,

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:41.080 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to squeeze
certain muscles.

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Then kind of lift them
up toward your heart.

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:45.160 align:middle line:84%
When you lift it or just
kind of draw it up--

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.577 align:middle line:84%
and don't worry if you can't
get that happening right now.

01:34:47.577 --> 01:34:50.875 align:middle line:84%
If you practice it multiple
times a day, in the next week

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.750 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start
to have a sense of what

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:53.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about.

01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:55.618 align:middle line:84%
In two weeks from now, you're
going to be doing this.

01:34:55.618 --> 01:34:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Do not give up.

01:34:57.850 --> 01:34:59.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just you just have
never tried to do it.

01:34:59.950 --> 01:35:01.742 align:middle line:84%
So then you're going
to squeeze the muscles

01:35:01.742 --> 01:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
in the center of your heart
inside the pectoralis muscles,

01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:05.830 align:middle line:90%
inside the shoulder blades.

01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:08.477 align:middle line:84%
Come into the core of the body,
and squeeze these muscles.

01:35:08.477 --> 01:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to constrict
the muscles in the throat

01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:14.548 align:middle line:84%
so that you close down this
aperture, because by squeezing

01:35:14.548 --> 01:35:16.090 align:middle line:84%
all this, what we're
doing is putting

01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:18.160 align:middle line:84%
the thumb over this
giant garden hose that is

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.900 align:middle line:90%
the central channel, all right?

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.390 align:middle line:90%
So now roll your eyes up.

01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's tension
behind the eyes.

01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:26.557 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel that tension behind
the eyes when you roll them up?

01:35:26.557 --> 01:35:28.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a plumb line, OK?

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:29.800 align:middle line:84%
A plumb line is
dropping straight

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.693 align:middle line:84%
down through the central
core of your body.

01:35:31.693 --> 01:35:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to
keep your eyes rolled up.

01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But find that place
behind your eyes.

01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:39.340 align:middle line:84%
You're actually pretty close to
the third eye area, all right?

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So roll your eyes up, and then
roll them slightly together.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.820 align:middle line:90%
And find that tension point.

01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Now relax your eyes so that you
don't get funky in your head.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And now take a
breath from overhead

01:35:51.010 --> 01:35:52.960 align:middle line:84%
right down through
this plumb line

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.960 align:middle line:84%
down through the central
core of your body.

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:57.460 align:middle line:84%
Inhale through the center of
your brain, through the throat,

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.032 align:middle line:84%
in through the
chest to the belly

01:35:59.032 --> 01:36:00.490 align:middle line:84%
where you're inhaling
to the belly.

01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:01.070 align:middle line:90%
[INHALES]

01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.910 align:middle line:90%
Big belly breath.

01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze Mula Bhanda.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
relax your eyes.

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:06.320 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
keep looking up.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:09.490 align:middle line:84%
But maintain your awareness
in this plumb line.

01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Exhale down through Mula Bhanda,
that Root Lock, into the Earth.

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Now inhale up from the Earth
through this Mula Bhanda

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:17.770 align:middle line:90%
into the belly.

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:18.970 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze your heart.

01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:22.130 align:middle line:90%


01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:23.670 align:middle line:90%
And then roll your eyes up.

01:36:23.670 --> 01:36:26.267 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, you're going
to exhale up through the heart

01:36:26.267 --> 01:36:27.350 align:middle line:90%
space, through the throat.

01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Constrict your throat so
you can hear your breath.

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And exhale right up
out behind your eyes

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.710 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of your head.

01:36:32.710 --> 01:36:35.780 align:middle line:84%
[INHALES] And then take
an inhale from overhead

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:39.560 align:middle line:84%
right into this big white
space behind your eyes,

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.840 align:middle line:84%
into the throat, into the
heart, into the belly.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.160 align:middle line:90%
And squeeze Mula Bhanda.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And exhale right
down into the Earth.

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Then take an inhale up from
the Earth into the belly.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:50.950 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze your heart.

01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:54.250 align:middle line:90%


01:36:54.250 --> 01:36:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And roll your eyes up.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Find your coordinates.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're way in here
inside the channel.

01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.310 align:middle line:84%
You're not in your
head watching this.

01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:02.950 align:middle line:84%
You've come down into
this elevator shaft.

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Come down in here, and
exhale yourself right up

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:07.568 align:middle line:84%
through the throat and
out from behind your eyes.

01:37:07.568 --> 01:37:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's imperative that
you not stay in your head

01:37:09.610 --> 01:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and envision this but that you
go down the elevator shaft,

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.210 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So you go in the elevator
at the third eye.

01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:18.250 align:middle line:84%
You inhale yourself
down through the throat,

01:37:18.250 --> 01:37:20.290 align:middle line:84%
down through the
heart, into the belly,

01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:22.840 align:middle line:84%
squeezing these four anchor
points along the way.

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Then you exhale yourself
down through the body

01:37:25.150 --> 01:37:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and into the Earth because
that's what's really happening.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:30.665 align:middle line:84%
If you just think about it,
you're intellectualizing it.

01:37:30.665 --> 01:37:32.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to be in
the experience of it.

01:37:32.290 --> 01:37:35.430 align:middle line:84%
So inhale yourself up from
the Earth through Mula Bhanda

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:middle line:90%
into the belly.

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.060 align:middle line:90%
Feel yourself in the belly.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Feel yourself in the belly.

01:37:39.250 --> 01:37:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Let it feel warm.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Let it feel good.

01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:42.250 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze your heart.

01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Sit down in there.

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.180 align:middle line:90%
Be comfortable.

01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Exhale yourself up through
the heart, through the throat.

01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:48.610 align:middle line:90%
Roll your eyes to this.

01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:50.050 align:middle line:90%
You're creating this channel.

01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're shooting
your breath out the top

01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:55.360 align:middle line:84%
of your head like a
whale would up and out,

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
a blowhole that it's
exhaling through.

01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Now inhale through that
blowhole again right

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:02.530 align:middle line:84%
down through this
central core channel.

01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:04.300 align:middle line:84%
You first start
the energy being.

01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:06.050 align:middle line:90%
You move energy with the breath.

01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:08.217 align:middle line:84%
The breath is the
spirit in the body.

01:38:08.217 --> 01:38:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Inhale all the way to the belly.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Four anchor points.

01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Mula Bhanda.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:11.710 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze the heart.

01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Constrict the throat.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Roll the eyes.

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Exhale yourself
down into the Earth.

01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:16.540 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.520 align:middle line:84%
You're probably going to start
to feel a little different just

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:19.540 align:middle line:90%
by doing this.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You come on to subject
when you do that, you start

01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to enhance the photon density.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.680 align:middle line:84%
You start to enhance
the density enough

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that the sensory
nervous system can

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:31.430 align:middle line:84%
start to pick up on who
you are, where you are,

01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:35.427 align:middle line:84%
where you live, who is the
true you underneath the story.

01:38:35.427 --> 01:38:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And everything begins to change.

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Exhale up and out through
the top of the head.

01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:41.350 align:middle line:84%
All right, so these
are some basic things

01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:44.180 align:middle line:84%
that I just want you to
have this understanding of.

01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:44.980 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:45.640 align:middle line:90%
Tracking there?

01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:46.255 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir.

01:38:46.255 --> 01:38:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a point where
you won't have to start

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:48.430 align:middle line:90%
constricting as much?

01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.870 align:middle line:10%
Or is it just--

01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:50.733 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, so the constriction
of the muscles.

01:38:50.733 --> 01:38:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
asking the question.

01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Someone else had asked
me something similar

01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:58.120 align:middle line:90%
before we got started today.

01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.460 align:middle line:84%
You constrict these four
anchor points in order

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:03.490 align:middle line:84%
to train the mind
to find you, OK?

01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.800 align:middle line:84%
You're training this mind
that's all about the story.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about (DEEPER TONE)
what's going on over there?

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:08.957 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe
this and that.

01:39:08.957 --> 01:39:10.330 align:middle line:90%
And dispersal.

01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying,
wait a second, boom.

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm calling this
all right back here.

01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:15.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm landing this.

01:39:15.700 --> 01:39:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that, we
familiarize ourselves

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:21.280 align:middle line:84%
with sitting in
that elevator shaft.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.215 align:middle line:84%
Then you don't have to contract
the muscles to stay there.

01:39:24.215 --> 01:39:25.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing these
practices but you

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.690 align:middle line:84%
find yourself breathing,
but you're thinking about,

01:39:28.690 --> 01:39:31.810 align:middle line:84%
oh, I wonder what I'm going
to do after this is over today

01:39:31.810 --> 01:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
kind of thing or what am
I supposed to do tomorrow,

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:36.310 align:middle line:90%
you're not here.

01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a mechanistic
thing that will not

01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:39.615 align:middle line:84%
give you the result
that you're looking

01:39:39.615 --> 01:39:41.525 align:middle line:90%
for if you can stay there.

01:39:41.525 --> 01:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to
wobble or disperse,

01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:44.983 align:middle line:84%
squeeze them back again,
take a few breaths,

01:39:44.983 --> 01:39:46.150 align:middle line:90%
then start to relax them.

01:39:46.150 --> 01:39:46.810 align:middle line:90%
And keep breathing.

01:39:46.810 --> 01:39:47.110 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:39:47.110 --> 01:39:49.158 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you've been
doing this for a while,

01:39:49.158 --> 01:39:51.493 align:middle line:84%
this should be something
that comes easy.

01:39:51.493 --> 01:39:52.894 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't have to--

01:39:52.894 --> 01:39:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, every breath that
you take from here on out,

01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.790 align:middle line:84%
the rest of your life, should
be a breath from somewhere

01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:06.330 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical body
into the body to beyond

01:40:06.330 --> 01:40:07.480 align:middle line:90%
the physical body.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So from beyond the body
into the physical body

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.510 align:middle line:90%
to beyond the body.

01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And then inhale from beyond
the body into the body.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And exhale beyond the body,
because every time you

01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:22.230 align:middle line:84%
do, you are affirming
that you are

01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:25.770 align:middle line:84%
more than this physical
body, that you are this.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where I would
take you in our coursework,

01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:32.340 align:middle line:84%
is identifying as this that
has created this vehicle

01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:35.490 align:middle line:84%
to move yourself through
this physical dimension to do

01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:37.660 align:middle line:90%
what you came here to do, OK?

01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Helpful there?

01:40:38.710 --> 01:40:39.160 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:39.960 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:43.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people feel rage,
when they clutch with rage--

01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:45.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --or fury--

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.660 align:middle line:90%
>> --even historical figures--

01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:48.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.646 align:middle line:84%
>> --are they trying to
call their energy back?

01:40:51.646 --> 01:40:53.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:54.660 align:middle line:90%
They're right here.

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're coming here
again and coming here again.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.820 align:middle line:84%
When something
happens and you feel,

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:03.660 align:middle line:84%
[GROWLS],, you feel your
body quickening like that,

01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:08.160 align:middle line:84%
it's gathering all this energy
that I'm speaking about.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's the bio field that's
concentrating so that it

01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:13.770 align:middle line:84%
can fold over on itself
that it can be self-aware,

01:41:13.770 --> 01:41:16.470 align:middle line:84%
it can become
self-reflective and feel

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:17.640 align:middle line:90%
and have a sense of self.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:19.832 align:middle line:84%
>> So [INAUDIBLE],, their
energy is out there,

01:41:19.832 --> 01:41:20.790 align:middle line:90%
and they're trying to--

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> They're trying to gather it
in here, you bet, absolutely,

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.290 align:middle line:84%
which is why Gandhi can have
such a huge impact by sitting

01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:27.090 align:middle line:90%
down.

01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's like the opposite
was happening.

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The revealing of his own
magnificence was occurring.

01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:34.860 align:middle line:10%
And people were drawn to
that in a culture that

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:38.700 align:middle line:10%
was available for
something like that, OK?

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:43.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
angry, you do this.

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.360 align:middle line:90%
And there's a purpose for that.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.190 align:middle line:10%
It's trying to anchor
you in the body.

01:41:47.190 --> 01:41:48.660 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to get you here.

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And so anger can serve.

01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:53.640 align:middle line:84%
But there's a way to work with
anger instead of acting it

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:56.190 align:middle line:84%
out or deflecting it or
writing a story about it

01:41:56.190 --> 01:41:57.570 align:middle line:90%
and getting stuck there.

01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:59.100 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to
come on in here.

01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:01.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, what I teach in the
level one of the coursework

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.690 align:middle line:10%
is how to make
those distinctions

01:42:03.690 --> 01:42:06.570 align:middle line:10%
and create this
thing for yourselves,

01:42:06.570 --> 01:42:10.980 align:middle line:10%
build the circuits so that we
take the wobble away so that we

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:13.560 align:middle line:10%
fill in the gaps where
these circuits are not,

01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.470 align:middle line:10%
because we need the anger if
the circuits aren't in place.

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:21.210 align:middle line:10%
We need the anger to anchor us
because the whole of creation

01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:24.870 align:middle line:10%
is expanding and anchoring
and expanding and anchoring

01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:27.750 align:middle line:10%
and expanding and anchoring
and expanding and anchoring.

01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's constantly
expanding, but it does so

01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:34.980 align:middle line:84%
through a series of expansions
and contractions and expansions

01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:36.000 align:middle line:90%
and contractions.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't call them
contractions because we

01:42:37.290 --> 01:42:38.540 align:middle line:90%
have a prejudice against that.

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:39.900 align:middle line:90%
But they're anchorings.

01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:44.790 align:middle line:10%
So emotions like fear and
anger and guilt and shame,

01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:48.870 align:middle line:10%
those kinds of energies
are anchoring energies.

01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And if we would embrace them,
we no longer have to hide them.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:55.950 align:middle line:84%
We can utilize them
to anchor ourselves.

01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we're available
to expand even higher.

01:42:58.450 --> 01:43:00.300 align:middle line:84%
So the roots go deeper,
and we, the tree,

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.690 align:middle line:90%
grows taller because of this.

01:43:01.690 --> 01:43:02.490 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a big technique
I want to teach you guys.

01:43:04.150 --> 01:43:05.192 align:middle line:90%
So I have to keep going.

01:43:05.192 --> 01:43:06.150 align:middle line:90%
But let me answer this.

01:43:06.150 --> 01:43:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So the wobble
that you mentioned,

01:43:07.650 --> 01:43:09.798 align:middle line:90%
can that present physically?

01:43:09.798 --> 01:43:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Can the wobble that I
mentioned present physically?

01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely does
present physically.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.640 align:middle line:84%
If you can see here-- and
I had a scoliosis-- can

01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.990 align:middle line:84%
you see how scoliosis
could be represented there?

01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.790 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:23.550 align:middle line:84%
If someone doesn't have
their root chakra in place,

01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:25.380 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have a hip issue.

01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:28.470 align:middle line:84%
If someone doesn't have their
root chakra or second chakra

01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:30.127 align:middle line:84%
actively integrating
with others,

01:43:30.127 --> 01:43:31.710 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
have low back issues.

01:43:31.710 --> 01:43:33.418 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
digestive problems.

01:43:33.418 --> 01:43:35.310 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
have adrenal fatigue.

01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:37.500 align:middle line:84%
These types of things
are definitely involved.

01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In the coursework, I teach
you all those relationships

01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and show you how it's all laid
out in a perfect map of what's

01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:45.480 align:middle line:90%
going on in your life.

01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:48.610 align:middle line:84%
There is zero mystery to
what's happening, yeah.

01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:43:49.410 --> 01:43:49.710 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

01:43:49.710 --> 01:43:50.866 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, mhm.

01:43:50.866 --> 01:43:54.100 align:middle line:10%
>> So she mentioned earlier
as far as the anger, right--

01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:54.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:55.800 align:middle line:10%
>> --and holding everything in.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:56.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:00.455 align:middle line:10%
>> You're saying not to block
it because that's something that

01:44:00.455 --> 01:44:01.568 align:middle line:10%
we need to realize.

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:02.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, don't block it at all.

01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:03.340 align:middle line:10%
Embrace it.

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.990 align:middle line:10%
In fact, let me just
show you this, OK?

01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:08.235 align:middle line:10%
So there's another technique
that I want to get to.

01:44:08.235 --> 01:44:09.610 align:middle line:10%
And it's going to
take us a while

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:10.990 align:middle line:10%
to teach it and do it, OK?

01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:12.387 align:middle line:10%
So I'm watching the clock.

01:44:12.387 --> 01:44:13.970 align:middle line:10%
And I'm watching
what we're doing here

01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:17.290 align:middle line:10%
because I want you to have this
because it's huge, all right?

01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:18.520 align:middle line:10%
But let's say this.

01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.590 align:middle line:10%
And this is even
bigger than what I'm

01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:23.740 align:middle line:10%
going to teach you in detail.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we're
going to head and build

01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:28.240 align:middle line:84%
upon tremendously
in the coursework

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that I teach called the
Energy Codes coursework, which

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:32.860 align:middle line:90%
you can find on my website.

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:35.922 align:middle line:84%
But right now, let me give
you just a taste of it

01:44:35.922 --> 01:44:38.380 align:middle line:84%
so that you can start playing
around with this a little bit

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:39.510 align:middle line:90%
in the meantime.

01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:41.450 align:middle line:84%
When you feel anger or
you feel some emotion

01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:43.450 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want to
feel, take your attention

01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to the body.

01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember when I said go
onto object and notice

01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:51.670 align:middle line:84%
how you feel in your body
and it doesn't feel so good?

01:44:51.670 --> 01:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
You come onto subject,
and it feels better.

01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And we're just starting to adapt
our sensory nervous system.

01:44:58.570 --> 01:45:01.540 align:middle line:10%
We're developing sensory
acuity in the core of our body.

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.580 align:middle line:10%
And that's the key.

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:09.880 align:middle line:10%
So if we are splatted by
an emotion like anger,

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.740 align:middle line:10%
if in the same moment
that you're angry,

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.450 align:middle line:10%
if you take your attention
to the body-- and you're

01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:14.992 align:middle line:10%
going to read about
this in the book.

01:45:14.992 --> 01:45:17.020 align:middle line:84%
If you get the book,
this particular skill

01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:18.100 align:middle line:90%
is in there, as well.

01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:21.280 align:middle line:84%
It's a fantastic way to start
to build the circuits to take

01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the wobble out of your world,
because you feel anger because

01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:26.560 align:middle line:90%
of lack of circuitry.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.360 align:middle line:84%
If all of your
circuits were in place,

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:29.665 align:middle line:90%
nothing would bother you.

01:45:29.665 --> 01:45:32.290 align:middle line:10%
Nothing would bother you if all
of your circuits were in place.

01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

01:45:33.130 --> 01:45:33.580 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:34.240 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.823 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're awake at all
of the vibrational frequencies

01:45:36.823 --> 01:45:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of your wholeness, so
nothing's going to anger you.

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.597 align:middle line:84%
You might take
action on something.

01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:44.430 align:middle line:84%
You might have an
assertion about something.

01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:45.720 align:middle line:84%
You might be passionate
about something.

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.640 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't
personally threaten you.

01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:48.440 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:49.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a lack of circuitry.

01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So the next time you're angry
or hurt or upset or afraid,

01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:55.180 align:middle line:90%
take your attention to the body.

01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:58.140 align:middle line:84%
There's going to be a charge
somewhere in your body.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.710 align:middle line:84%
It's going to show
up like a knot

01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:01.060 align:middle line:84%
in your stomach, a
lump in your throat,

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:02.060 align:middle line:90%
tightness in your chest.

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Something is going to happen.

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.255 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze it back.

01:46:05.255 --> 01:46:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Just squeeze it back.

01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:07.270 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to squeeze.

01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:10.600 align:middle line:84%
It's squeezing because there's
a lack of circuits there.

01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:12.970 align:middle line:90%
Your system's trying to rise up.

01:46:12.970 --> 01:46:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And it hits the
lack of circuitry.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And it creates this
rush of excess energy.

01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And you feel it like a
knotted up place in your gut,

01:46:21.010 --> 01:46:23.440 align:middle line:84%
in your heart, in your throat,
in your chest, somewhere.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.197 align:middle line:84%
You squeeze it back, and you
let it know, I'm onto this.

01:46:26.197 --> 01:46:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm finally going to
use this system the way

01:46:28.030 --> 01:46:29.050 align:middle line:90%
it was built to be used.

01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:30.508 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
it to my advantage

01:46:30.508 --> 01:46:33.130 align:middle line:84%
instead of just trying to
fend for myself alone out

01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:34.337 align:middle line:90%
here as this mind.

01:46:34.337 --> 01:46:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the
body and the mind

01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:37.870 align:middle line:84%
and the breath together
to build the circuits

01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:41.110 align:middle line:84%
to [INHALES] come into
this fullness of my system.

01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So you take your
attention to the body,

01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:46.280 align:middle line:84%
see where there's a
charge, squeeze it back.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.555 align:middle line:10%
Let it know contact has been
made so that the mind is

01:46:48.555 --> 01:46:49.930 align:middle line:10%
telling the body,
OK, I'm finally

01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:52.013 align:middle line:10%
listening, because if the
soul speaks to the body,

01:46:52.013 --> 01:46:54.580 align:middle line:10%
the body speaks to the mind,
and the mind doesn't listen?

01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:55.690 align:middle line:90%
(DEEPER TONE) Now I'm listening.

01:46:55.690 --> 01:46:56.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening.

01:46:56.350 --> 01:46:57.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've suffered long enough.

01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening.

01:46:58.110 --> 01:46:59.050 align:middle line:90%
All right already.

01:46:59.050 --> 01:47:01.690 align:middle line:84%
So here, you don't
just observe it.

01:47:01.690 --> 01:47:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Observation is not enough.

01:47:03.260 --> 01:47:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It does create some
photon density.

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to
talk body talk.

01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:08.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't talk mind
talk to the body

01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and expect the body to
get that you get it.

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:10.960 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.920 align:middle line:90%
You squeeze it back.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.660 align:middle line:84%
You squeeze your
four anchor points.

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:17.290 align:middle line:10%
And you start coming in here and
breathing because when you do,

01:47:17.290 --> 01:47:20.330 align:middle line:10%
you start to build the circuitry
in the electromagnetic energy

01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:21.130 align:middle line:10%
field.

01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:23.650 align:middle line:10%
You start to stream
energy through there

01:47:23.650 --> 01:47:26.590 align:middle line:10%
in a fashion that's
coherent, that's consistent,

01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:28.620 align:middle line:10%
that's robust and now focused.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And you breathe up and
down the central channel

01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:34.420 align:middle line:84%
until the knot or the lump
or the charge dissipates.

01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And as it dissipates,
it dissipates

01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:40.390 align:middle line:84%
because we've created more
of this perfected flow

01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:43.600 align:middle line:84%
than the wobbly flow that's
associated with the story that

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.950 align:middle line:84%
elicits the anger or the fear
or the frustration in you.

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:47.830 align:middle line:90%
You got that?

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The next time you're angry,
take your attention to the body.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:51.897 align:middle line:10%
Next time you're freaked
out, afraid, upset,

01:47:51.897 --> 01:47:53.230 align:middle line:10%
take your attention to the body.

01:47:53.230 --> 01:47:54.897 align:middle line:84%
There's a charge
somewhere in your body.

01:47:54.897 --> 01:47:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And your body is
trying to set you free.

01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.210 align:middle line:90%
Just come here.

01:47:58.210 --> 01:47:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Come home.

01:47:58.780 --> 01:47:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Come right here.

01:47:59.710 --> 01:48:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Build some circuits,
and let this flow

01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:04.300 align:middle line:90%
happen so that this can happen.

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Got that?

01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:06.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
teach you something

01:48:07.930 --> 01:48:13.390 align:middle line:84%
that's going to take you
into gunk hunting, all right?

01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to dissolve
this stuff really rapidly.

01:48:16.330 --> 01:48:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's a muscle testing
technique that you can learn,

01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:20.810 align:middle line:90%
that you can do on yourself.

01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:22.773 align:middle line:90%
You can do it with someone else.

01:48:22.773 --> 01:48:24.190 align:middle line:84%
You can get together
with friends.

01:48:24.190 --> 01:48:25.430 align:middle line:90%
You can show them how to do it.

01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:27.472 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just show them
how to push on your arm

01:48:27.472 --> 01:48:28.840 align:middle line:90%
so that you can do this, OK?

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm taking you
back to the nervous system

01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:34.090 align:middle line:90%
because here's the deal.

01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:36.130 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic
energy system

01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:39.340 align:middle line:90%
creates the nervous system.

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:41.360 align:middle line:90%
It creates the nervous system.

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous system
runs your body, OK?

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:51.220 align:middle line:10%
And so the nervous system
stores information.

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.978 align:middle line:10%
And it's constantly referencing
that information, et cetera.

01:48:53.978 --> 01:48:56.020 align:middle line:10%
So we want to update the
information that's being

01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:59.140 align:middle line:10%
stored in subconscious memory.

01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So now what we're doing
with the energy codes work

01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is working with
energy on every level.

01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to teach you a
way to clear some subconscious

01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:09.300 align:middle line:90%
interference.

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.258 align:middle line:90%
So here's what happens.

01:49:10.258 --> 01:49:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember I said
earlier that what

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.980 align:middle line:84%
closes the trapdoor, what
slams shut the trapdoor,

01:49:14.980 --> 01:49:16.240 align:middle line:90%
is unresolved emotion.

01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:19.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the number one cause
of the trapdoor slamming shut

01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and your conscious
and your subconscious

01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:25.360 align:middle line:84%
no longer being in constant
communication with each other.

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:28.030 align:middle line:84%
So then you think it's time
to relax, but your body won't.

01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:29.590 align:middle line:90%
You want to heal, but you don't.

01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:34.610 align:middle line:84%
You want to be more successful
or to master life in some way

01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:37.410 align:middle line:84%
or to manifest in certain
ways that aren't happening.

01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It's your subconscious that
runs your life, all right?

01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And so awakening
is about bringing

01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:44.140 align:middle line:84%
what is subconscious up
to the conscious level,

01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:47.590 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of that which
you were not aware of before.

01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I'm teaching you.

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do
right now is show you

01:49:53.320 --> 01:50:00.160 align:middle line:84%
a technique that will
allow you to begin

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to address opening the trapdoor
in rapid fire in a very

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:04.410 align:middle line:90%
tangible fashion.

01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:06.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just working
with invisible energy.

01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We're kind of using the
body and muscle testing ways

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:13.037 align:middle line:84%
and clearing up some unresolved
emotion without using the mind

01:50:13.037 --> 01:50:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to do it, but using the mind
and the body and the breath

01:50:15.370 --> 01:50:16.430 align:middle line:90%
collectively to do so.

01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:17.230 align:middle line:90%
Makes sense?

01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:17.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So I need someone
who's never seen me do

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:22.360 align:middle line:90%
best release, a technique to--

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.160 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Come on up, sir.

01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:28.020 align:middle line:90%
All right, so hi.

01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:28.870 align:middle line:90%
What's your name?

01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:29.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Ash.

01:50:29.370 --> 01:50:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:30.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Ash.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:31.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Ash?

01:50:31.565 --> 01:50:32.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:50:32.365 --> 01:50:34.706 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not what it says.

01:50:34.706 --> 01:50:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's says [INAUDIBLE].

01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Somebody else.

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:39.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, just putting it
all together here.

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:44.640 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I want you to
think about something

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.400 align:middle line:84%
that you'd like to have
manifest in your life, something

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:54.547 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to hold
as true for you, that you feel

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.130 align:middle line:84%
you would love to
have, what you would

01:50:56.130 --> 01:50:58.590 align:middle line:84%
love to have occur in your
life as though it's already

01:50:58.590 --> 01:50:59.390 align:middle line:90%
happening.

01:50:59.390 --> 01:51:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Think about it in present
term and positive sense.

01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So present tense,
positive sense, not, I

01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:08.190 align:middle line:90%
want to do this next year.

01:51:08.190 --> 01:51:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But claim it as though
it's already happening, OK?

01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:12.000 align:middle line:90%
So can you think of something?

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so right now,
I just want you to--

01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:17.310 align:middle line:90%
what's your name?

01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's Pash?

01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:18.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Ash.

01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Ash, OK.

01:51:19.770 --> 01:51:20.570 align:middle line:90%
Ash.

01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:21.850 align:middle line:90%
So just hold this right here.

01:51:21.850 --> 01:51:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Relax your wrist.

01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:23.792 align:middle line:90%
Keep your elbow straight.

01:51:23.792 --> 01:51:25.667 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to press
down toward the floor.

01:51:25.667 --> 01:51:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
let me push down on it.

01:51:27.690 --> 01:51:31.200 align:middle line:90%
So just think my name is Ash.

01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:32.100 align:middle line:90%
And hold here.

01:51:32.100 --> 01:51:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Push back.

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And think my name is Sue.

01:51:35.970 --> 01:51:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And push back here.

01:51:38.190 --> 01:51:40.258 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel the
difference there?

01:51:40.258 --> 01:51:41.675 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel the
difference there?

01:51:41.675 --> 01:51:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:42.855 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Ash.

01:51:42.855 --> 01:51:43.910 align:middle line:90%
All right, just checking.

01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:45.485 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is not
Sue, definitely.

01:51:45.485 --> 01:51:48.412 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] We definitely know
your name is not Sue now, OK?

01:51:48.412 --> 01:51:50.370 align:middle line:84%
So this is one of the
things that my father was

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:52.740 align:middle line:90%
working with when we were kids.

01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And my brothers and I
were very disappointed

01:51:55.170 --> 01:51:57.570 align:middle line:84%
when we realized that
when we told the truth,

01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.860 align:middle line:90%
our arm was strong.

01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:02.215 align:middle line:84%
And when we told a
lie, our arm went weak.

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It was a very sad
day in our household.

01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:05.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHING] Did
you go to the party?

01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:09.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:10.022 align:middle line:90%
Whoosh.

01:52:10.022 --> 01:52:13.670 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:52:13.670 --> 01:52:14.712 align:middle line:90%
We didn't stay very long.

01:52:14.712 --> 01:52:15.512 align:middle line:90%
Whoosh.

01:52:15.512 --> 01:52:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

01:52:16.580 --> 01:52:18.147 align:middle line:84%
OK, we had the
party at our house

01:52:18.147 --> 01:52:19.730 align:middle line:84%
while you were
traveling and teaching.

01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.444 align:middle line:90%
Boom, strong.

01:52:21.444 --> 01:52:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Yah.

01:52:22.290 --> 01:52:24.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:27.110 align:middle line:10%
So now I want you to
think about your goal,

01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:30.202 align:middle line:10%
your vision, this thing that
you would love to have manifest.

01:52:30.202 --> 01:52:31.410 align:middle line:10%
You got what I'm saying here?

01:52:31.410 --> 01:52:33.410 align:middle line:10%
So he's tapping into a
vibrational frequency that's

01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:35.370 align:middle line:10%
higher than the one his
body is operating in,

01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:36.470 align:middle line:10%
or it wouldn't be a dream.

01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:37.720 align:middle line:90%
It would be happening already.

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.137 align:middle line:84%
So he's just
thinking of something

01:52:39.137 --> 01:52:41.990 align:middle line:84%
that he would like to have be
manifesting true in his life

01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:43.380 align:middle line:90%
as though it already is there.

01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.180 align:middle line:90%
OK, think of it.

01:52:44.180 --> 01:52:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Hold this right here.

01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And push back.

01:52:46.410 --> 01:52:50.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the good news is we
can do something to help, OK?

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So what is happening right
now is his subconscious

01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:55.400 align:middle line:84%
doesn't believe that the
vibration of that goal

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.530 align:middle line:84%
is a safe vibration for
his system to access.

01:52:58.530 --> 01:53:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It's too vibrationally
different, so it shuts it out.

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:01.700 align:middle line:90%
It's like, nope.

01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something stored
in the subconscious mind,

01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:07.400 align:middle line:84%
in the subconscious memory,
that says no, we are this.

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious'
job is to protect him.

01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:11.960 align:middle line:84%
It's to keep him alive,
keep him safe until he can

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.240 align:middle line:90%
do what he's here to do, OK?

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to
ward off anything

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.330 align:middle line:90%
that's too high of a vibration.

01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:19.700 align:middle line:84%
If he's vibrating here and
he has this goal that's here,

01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:21.492 align:middle line:84%
it's like, no, I can't
get there from here.

01:53:21.492 --> 01:53:23.960 align:middle line:10%
If it was here, if the goal
was here, I could do that.

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:24.860 align:middle line:90%
But mm-mm.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.320 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
do is lift him to here

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:30.050 align:middle line:84%
because the subconscious
will make a jump like this,

01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:31.610 align:middle line:84%
but it won't make
a jump this big.

01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow?

01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just too different,
too far, too foreign.

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So I love it that I
get to talk like this,

01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:38.183 align:middle line:84%
and you guys are like,
yeah, get it, get it.

01:53:38.183 --> 01:53:41.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, 20 years ago,
people would be like, what?

01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It's just so awesome, such
an awesome time to be alive.

01:53:44.390 --> 01:53:47.330 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I want you
to understand that there

01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:48.660 align:middle line:90%
are six basic things--

01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:51.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't go into the long
detailed explanation

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.020 align:middle line:84%
as to why-- but there are
six basic emotional states

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and dispositions that
interfere with the system being

01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:00.200 align:middle line:90%
free to manifest, et cetera.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's on your
sheet, those six words.

01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:04.480 align:middle line:84%
It's fear, anger,
love, and sadness

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:07.760 align:middle line:84%
are the four psychological
reasons that all emotions can

01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.720 align:middle line:90%
be boiled down to.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.570 align:middle line:84%
All other emotions
spring forth from those.

01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Another disposition that we
encounter is that we judge.

01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And because we judge,
we take ourselves

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.480 align:middle line:84%
out of the big
celebration of life, OK?

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.220 align:middle line:84%
We take ourselves
out of the big Yes.

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.660 align:middle line:10%
When we decide, no, that
shouldn't have happened,

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:28.422 align:middle line:10%
we now are no longer in the
game of the green out here.

01:54:28.422 --> 01:54:29.630 align:middle line:10%
We're in the game of the red.

01:54:29.630 --> 01:54:31.755 align:middle line:10%
So Ash, if you can just
step back for just a second

01:54:31.755 --> 01:54:33.710 align:middle line:10%
here and just let me
show that, right here,

01:54:33.710 --> 01:54:34.790 align:middle line:10%
this is who you are.

01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying to have
that experience of you

01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:38.990 align:middle line:90%
all the way here.

01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:41.840 align:middle line:10%
And when we judge something as
right or wrong, good or bad,

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.200 align:middle line:10%
should or shouldn't, boom,
we get stuck right out here.

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.160 align:middle line:90%
We draw some gunk.

01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Or we blow some circuits
right here in the mental body.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And so we've taken
ourselves out of the game

01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:52.760 align:middle line:90%
of playing in the green.

01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And now we're living
inside this box of the red,

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.870 align:middle line:90%
of the judgemental mind.

01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:57.850 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:54:57.850 --> 01:55:02.110 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we want to make
sure that's out of the way.

01:55:02.110 --> 01:55:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to check
to see if that's going on,

01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:06.590 align:middle line:84%
if judgment happened,
if the byproduct of that

01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:09.930 align:middle line:84%
is running the show, or if
it's one of these basic four

01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:10.730 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

01:55:10.730 --> 01:55:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And so he doesn't
have to understand

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.990 align:middle line:84%
how these emotions, these
words that I'm going to say,

01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:17.720 align:middle line:84%
relate to his goal,
because they're vibrations.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:20.875 align:middle line:84%
And they are active
instantly in his system.

01:55:20.875 --> 01:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have to understand
the story between it.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.160 align:middle line:10%
All of this work is
about getting you

01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:28.100 align:middle line:10%
underneath the level
of story and processing

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.930 align:middle line:10%
all of the vibrational
frequencies

01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:32.930 align:middle line:10%
that you are made of and
integrating them so that you

01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:34.590 align:middle line:10%
have access to all of them.

01:55:34.590 --> 01:55:35.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

01:55:35.550 --> 01:55:37.040 align:middle line:90%
So now you hold this here.

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.035 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going to think
of these words one at a time.

01:55:41.035 --> 01:55:43.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep your eyes
closed because they were

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.630 align:middle line:90%
closed when your arm went weak.

01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to do that.

01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow what I'm saying?

01:55:46.910 --> 01:55:48.500 align:middle line:84%
If his eyes had
been open, I'd have

01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:51.700 align:middle line:84%
tested all these other
words with his eyes open.

01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:55.437 align:middle line:84%
If his eyes had been open
and this goal tested strong,

01:55:55.437 --> 01:55:57.020 align:middle line:84%
I would have him
close his eyes, and I

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:59.300 align:middle line:84%
would test it both ways,
because one of the other

01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:00.290 align:middle line:90%
might make it go weak.

01:56:00.290 --> 01:56:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And I want to find the
one that makes it go weak.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Got it?

01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:05.480 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now you're
keeping your eyes closed.

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
just say six words.

01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:09.272 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to test your
arm in between each of them.

01:56:09.272 --> 01:56:10.520 align:middle line:90%
So you hold it right here.

01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me push it down.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:13.620 align:middle line:90%
And think of the word "fear."

01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'm asking, what's
in the interference?

01:56:15.370 --> 01:56:16.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it fear?

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.060 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:17.930 align:middle line:90%
Is it anger?

01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:19.800 align:middle line:10%
Is it love?

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.720 align:middle line:10%
Hold here.

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.680 align:middle line:10%
Is it sadness?

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:22.730 --> 01:56:24.020 align:middle line:90%
Is it enjoyment?

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:25.040 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it judgment?

01:56:26.630 --> 01:56:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:28.140 --> 01:56:28.940 align:middle line:90%
There it is.

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:33.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the word "judgement"
short circuits his system.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.810 align:middle line:84%
If I go back to
anger, push back here.

01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:36.770 align:middle line:90%
It's not anger.

01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:37.250 align:middle line:90%
Hold here.

01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Is it judgment?

01:56:38.130 --> 01:56:38.930 align:middle line:90%
It's judgment.

01:56:38.930 --> 01:56:39.730 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

01:56:39.730 --> 01:56:41.030 align:middle line:90%
So you have these six options.

01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They all represent different
vibrational frequencies.

01:56:43.490 --> 01:56:46.040 align:middle line:84%
The one that's nailing
him is judgment.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:48.608 align:middle line:84%
So he doesn't even have to
know, was it him that judged?

01:56:48.608 --> 01:56:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Was it somebody else
that judged him?

01:56:50.150 --> 01:56:52.700 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter because
it's the vibrational frequency

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:55.730 align:middle line:10%
of judgment itself that
short circuits my system.

01:56:55.730 --> 01:56:57.215 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's me
or somebody else,

01:56:57.215 --> 01:57:00.050 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter, because as
quantum science would tell us,

01:57:00.050 --> 01:57:02.270 align:middle line:90%
there's only one of us here, OK?

01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So if someone judged
you, they are a part

01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:06.920 align:middle line:84%
of your own consciousness that
is judging the other parts

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.030 align:middle line:90%
of your own consciousness.

01:57:08.030 --> 01:57:10.198 align:middle line:84%
And there's a battle
going on in there, OK?

01:57:10.198 --> 01:57:11.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the only thing
that's ever going on.

01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:15.410 align:middle line:84%
But that's another conversation
for another time, OK?

01:57:15.410 --> 01:57:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's have you take a step
forward with your right leg,

01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:19.765 align:middle line:90%
a little bit bigger.

01:57:19.765 --> 01:57:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
bend your knee so that you

01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:23.172 align:middle line:90%
can feel your muscle here.

01:57:23.172 --> 01:57:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's going to
be doing this exercise.

01:57:25.130 --> 01:57:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to raise
this left arm up overhead

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.240 align:middle line:90%
at about a 45 degree angle.

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Now you can open your eyes.

01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:34.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can look right up
here at your left thumb.

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So just open your
hand like this.

01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're just going
to look at this.

01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Now the other thing that you're
going to do is take this hand

01:57:40.670 --> 01:57:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and just place it
up here and open it.

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
open it wide like this

01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.000 align:middle line:84%
and bring it right
back down behind you.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.063 align:middle line:84%
Now, that motion
isn't necessary.

01:57:49.063 --> 01:57:50.480 align:middle line:84%
But that's the way
that he's going

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.850 align:middle line:84%
to have this hand
placed the proper way.

01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:54.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't want the thumb down.

01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And if I say, no,
point your thumb up,

01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.660 align:middle line:84%
we don't want him to
go around the other way

01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:02.040 align:middle line:84%
like your arm is being
twisted behind your back.

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.370 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be up
and open like this.

01:58:04.370 --> 01:58:05.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, got that?

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:07.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's a Cross Crawl exercise.

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Bend this leg so you can
feel yourself in there.

01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going to tilt
your head off center.

01:58:12.590 --> 01:58:14.933 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to close this eye.

01:58:14.933 --> 01:58:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And now you remember
those four anchor points?

01:58:16.850 --> 01:58:18.890 align:middle line:84%
One at the base of
the pelvic bowl.

01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:20.310 align:middle line:90%
One at the chest.

01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Squeeze the heart.

01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:23.037 align:middle line:90%
One, constrict the throat.

01:58:23.037 --> 01:58:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
looking right up here,

01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:27.140 align:middle line:84%
so feel that tension
right behind your eyes.

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:30.282 align:middle line:84%
Now this, I'll tell you what
it's going to activate later.

01:58:30.282 --> 01:58:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I want
you to take a deep breath

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:35.150 align:middle line:84%
in from the Earth up
through these points right

01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:37.010 align:middle line:90%
into your core, right into here.

01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And just focus on, I forgive any
interference regarding judgment

01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:46.130 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to this
goal known and unknown.

01:58:46.130 --> 01:58:48.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to know
how it affected you.

01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
to exhale, I want

01:58:50.210 --> 01:58:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you to exhale up
the top of your body

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:55.070 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of your head.

01:58:55.070 --> 01:58:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And take a deep breath
in from overhead.

01:58:57.800 --> 01:59:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And breathe in
down into the body.

01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:05.780 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:06.810 align:middle line:90%
Keep that leg bent.

01:59:06.810 --> 01:59:08.630 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

01:59:08.630 --> 01:59:11.090 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale into the Earth.

01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And then step back to center.

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to step forward

01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:16.880 align:middle line:90%
with your opposite foot.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.480 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
do the other side.

01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:19.790 align:middle line:90%
And now this arm goes up.

01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's the opposite arm
and leg are coming forward.

01:59:23.090 --> 01:59:25.010 align:middle line:90%
This opposite arm comes up here.

01:59:25.010 --> 01:59:27.217 align:middle line:84%
And that swings around here
just so that these hands

01:59:27.217 --> 01:59:28.050 align:middle line:90%
are placed properly.

01:59:28.050 --> 01:59:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how
to do that, then you

01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:33.110 align:middle line:84%
don't have to actually
do the ceremony

01:59:33.110 --> 01:59:35.162 align:middle line:90%
of arching it this way.

01:59:35.162 --> 01:59:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And you bend this leg so
that you can feel this knee.

01:59:37.370 --> 01:59:38.703 align:middle line:90%
This gets you down in your body.

01:59:38.703 --> 01:59:39.787 align:middle line:90%
It gets you down in there.

01:59:39.787 --> 01:59:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And you squeeze Mula
Bhanda, this Root Lock.

01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And you squeeze your heart.

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.360 align:middle line:90%
And you constrict your throat.

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:47.000 align:middle line:90%
And you look right up this arm.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Now if you can close
this opposite eye,

01:59:49.130 --> 01:59:50.420 align:middle line:90%
that's even better.

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:53.120 align:middle line:84%
It just starts to add more
things into this Cross Crawl

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.380 align:middle line:84%
contralateral exercise
that we're working with.

01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Now take a deep breath
in from overhead.

01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Breathe into your belly.

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if you start
at the top or the bottom--

02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:02.780 align:middle line:90%
wherever you feel drawn.

02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And just focus on, I forgive any
interference regarding judgment

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:09.920 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to this goal,
conscious or subconscious,

02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:11.570 align:middle line:90%
known and unknown.

02:00:11.570 --> 02:00:12.500 align:middle line:90%
And exhale.

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.430 align:middle line:90%
Drop it into the Earth.

02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And then keep these four
anchor points squeezed.

02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And then take a breath up from
the Earth through Mula Bhanda,

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:22.540 align:middle line:84%
through the squeezed heart,
right into the belly here.

02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:26.670 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:27.770 align:middle line:90%
And constrict the throat.

02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And roll the eyes just
enough that you can feel

02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:30.980 align:middle line:90%
the tension behind your eyes.

02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And then as you exhale,
up through the throat

02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:33.977 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of the head.

02:00:33.977 --> 02:00:36.510 align:middle line:90%


02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:37.560 align:middle line:90%
And then one last breath.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.428 align:middle line:90%
Let's just come in.

02:00:38.428 --> 02:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Just go up and down the
channel a couple of times

02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:42.990 align:middle line:90%
into the core.

02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:47.670 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

02:00:47.670 --> 02:00:48.967 align:middle line:90%
And then right back to center.

02:00:48.967 --> 02:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to do the
same thing the opposite side.

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.100 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Right leg forward.

02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Other right leg forward.

02:00:54.630 --> 02:00:55.430 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:58.020 align:middle line:10%
And the left leg
here-- or the left arm.

02:00:58.020 --> 02:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm really confusing you.

02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:00.520 align:middle line:90%
OK, right here.

02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Out there.

02:01:01.320 --> 02:01:02.612 align:middle line:90%
Sweet, bend this knee.

02:01:02.612 --> 02:01:04.320 align:middle line:84%
That's where you'll
forget it, and you'll

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.710 align:middle line:84%
miss the great benefit of
being down here in your body.

02:01:07.710 --> 02:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Right there.

02:01:08.610 --> 02:01:10.410 align:middle line:90%
So deep breath in.

02:01:10.410 --> 02:01:15.090 align:middle line:84%
I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

02:01:15.090 --> 02:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Breathe it up.

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.040 align:middle line:90%
And then exhale out.

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Or breathe it down,
and exhale down.

02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And then one last breath from
one end of the central channel

02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
into the core of the body.

02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.170 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

02:01:31.170 --> 02:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale up and
out through the other end

02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:36.960 align:middle line:90%
of the channel.

02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:38.200 align:middle line:90%
And then step back to center.

02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.870 align:middle line:90%
You following what I'm saying?

02:01:39.870 --> 02:01:41.570 align:middle line:90%
That's a contralateral exercise.

02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:43.220 align:middle line:90%
The leg, once more.

02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.850 align:middle line:90%
The leg.

02:01:44.850 --> 02:01:46.917 align:middle line:90%
The other opposite arm.

02:01:46.917 --> 02:01:48.980 align:middle line:90%
>> So you do up and then down?

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.780 align:middle line:90%
Up and down?

02:01:49.780 --> 02:01:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:01:51.630 --> 02:01:52.625 align:middle line:90%
OK, got it?

02:01:52.625 --> 02:01:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Tilt this off-center.

02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

02:01:54.650 --> 02:01:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Pardon.

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it my left eye I close?

02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You close the opposite
eye from the arm that's up

02:01:59.260 --> 02:02:00.280 align:middle line:90%
in front.

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Deep breath in from above,
let's say, into the core.

02:02:04.650 --> 02:02:06.850 align:middle line:10%
And exhale into the Earth.

02:02:06.850 --> 02:02:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And then inhale.

02:02:08.770 --> 02:02:11.320 align:middle line:84%
I forgive any interference
regarding judgment

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:12.700 align:middle line:90%
as it relates to this goal.

02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And then exhale
out the other end.

02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:17.910 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's come
back to center.

02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:20.220 align:middle line:90%
And just hold this out here.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.780 align:middle line:90%
And just relax here.

02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Hold right here.

02:02:22.650 --> 02:02:23.450 align:middle line:90%
Hold this up.

02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:24.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me push it down.

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Think of the word "judgement."

02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Push back here.

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Push back here.

02:02:28.330 --> 02:02:29.130 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

02:02:29.130 --> 02:02:30.540 align:middle line:90%
I could do pull-ups on this.

02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:31.922 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:02:31.922 --> 02:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And now think of your goal,
because this is the key, right?

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:37.080 align:middle line:84%
So think of the goal as
though it already exists.

02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:38.430 align:middle line:10%
And push right back here.

02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:40.380 align:middle line:10%
Think of this.

02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:41.960 align:middle line:10%
Fantastic.

02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:42.920 align:middle line:90%
Rock on.

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:43.750 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm cured!

02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:45.990 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHING] Thank you.

02:02:47.070 --> 02:02:48.130 align:middle line:90%
That is awesome.

02:02:48.130 --> 02:02:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

02:02:48.930 --> 02:02:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you doing it
once on each side?

02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's up and down.

02:02:54.260 --> 02:02:55.740 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:56.540 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:56.540 --> 02:02:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:57.570 --> 02:02:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:02:59.510 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Up and down.

02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:00.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Twice on each side.

02:03:00.402 --> 02:03:01.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Four times.

02:03:01.286 --> 02:03:02.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Four times.

02:03:02.187 --> 02:03:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I noticed--

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:03.978 align:middle line:90%
>> Two times each side.

02:03:03.978 --> 02:03:06.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --sometimes you inhale down.

02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't matter.

02:03:07.710 --> 02:03:09.467 align:middle line:90%
You just have to go--

02:03:09.467 --> 02:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I used to teach that
you have to start here.

02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But if you let yourself go
to where you need to go,

02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:17.150 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
there faster instead

02:03:17.150 --> 02:03:19.670 align:middle line:84%
of me dictating that
you start at the top

02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to be drawn
to where the energy is really

02:03:22.370 --> 02:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
needing to be worked with.

02:03:23.500 --> 02:03:25.515 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so there's no
particular reason why you--

02:03:25.515 --> 02:03:26.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You just have to--

02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
no, no.

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:27.985 align:middle line:90%
Just go twice.

02:03:27.985 --> 02:03:28.785 align:middle line:90%
>> Twice.

02:03:28.785 --> 02:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Just go twice each side.

02:03:30.670 --> 02:03:33.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's opposite arm
and leg because you're

02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:36.280 align:middle line:10%
activating the right hemisphere
and the left hemisphere

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:39.220 align:middle line:10%
of the brain, the
cerebellum right and left,

02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.040 align:middle line:10%
the vestibular apparatus,
which is your balance,

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.290 align:middle line:10%
and so forth, the optic centers,
the respiratory centers,

02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:47.540 align:middle line:10%
the right side of the body,
the left side of the body,

02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.750 align:middle line:10%
the upper body and
the lower body.

02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:51.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's a sequencing.

02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:52.030 align:middle line:90%
We're resetting it.

02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It's like a big engine
that all the parts work,

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's not firing to
start to burn the fuel

02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:59.000 align:middle line:90%
to get the engine started.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So all of that
happening simultaneously

02:04:02.050 --> 02:04:04.253 align:middle line:84%
is a giant reset that
allows your system

02:04:04.253 --> 02:04:05.170 align:middle line:90%
to build the circuits.

02:04:05.170 --> 02:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The central channel
breathing is to do this.

02:04:07.690 --> 02:04:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The holding of the
breath is that your body,

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
if you breathe in and
hold it as long as you can

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and exhale, when you're
doing this on your own,

02:04:15.190 --> 02:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
hold it as long as
you can and then

02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:19.930 align:middle line:84%
exhale, because the longer
you hold your breath,

02:04:19.930 --> 02:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
the more your body
starts evaluating,

02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
do I really need to keep all
this other noise going on

02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:25.840 align:middle line:90%
in my nervous system?

02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Or do I need to just
drop it because it

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.710 align:middle line:90%
requires more energy?

02:04:29.710 --> 02:04:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, I could
conserve more energy

02:04:33.010 --> 02:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and it will last longer
if this person can't take

02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
another breath for a while.

02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:37.790 align:middle line:90%
You follow?

02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:41.463 align:middle line:84%
So it'll be helpful in
re-evaluating and allowing

02:04:41.463 --> 02:04:42.505 align:middle line:90%
the body to reprioritize.

02:04:42.505 --> 02:04:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> By holding the breath
longer, what happens?

02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:48.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, if you hold
your breath longer,

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.510 align:middle line:10%
what begins to happen
is you begin to signal

02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:58.300 align:middle line:10%
to the subconscious nervous
system that if another breath

02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:02.260 align:middle line:10%
can't be taken in a while, I
should relax these muscles that

02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.960 align:middle line:10%
are tense, keeping me
in defense physiology,

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:08.463 align:middle line:10%
because they consume more
oxygen than if I release them.

02:05:08.463 --> 02:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
If I release them, they're
not consuming the oxygen.

02:05:10.630 --> 02:05:14.705 align:middle line:84%
In case he can't take
another breath for a while,

02:05:14.705 --> 02:05:17.080 align:middle line:84%
it will save the energy and
he could survive a little bit

02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:17.480 align:middle line:90%
longer.

02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:19.360 align:middle line:10%
So we're using the body's
survival mechanisms

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:23.873 align:middle line:10%
upon itself to allow
for a new breakthrough.

02:05:23.873 --> 02:05:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So basically, then,
what we're doing is,

02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:28.720 align:middle line:84%
right in the middle of flipping
all those breaker switches off,

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
we're putting in a new
idea of forgiveness

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.670 align:middle line:84%
about the very thing that
slammed the trapdoor shut

02:05:33.670 --> 02:05:35.040 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:36.550 align:middle line:10%
So that's how we're
working with it.

02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:39.370 align:middle line:90%
So you can also self-test here.

02:05:39.370 --> 02:05:41.710 align:middle line:84%
You can do any kind
of self muscle testing

02:05:41.710 --> 02:05:43.373 align:middle line:90%
that you're familiar with.

02:05:43.373 --> 02:05:45.040 align:middle line:10%
If you make a ring
with one hand and you

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:47.498 align:middle line:10%
make a ring with the other hand
and you flatten one of them

02:05:47.498 --> 02:05:49.120 align:middle line:10%
and insert it inside
the other, you

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.370 align:middle line:10%
can use this one to pry
it open and this one

02:05:51.370 --> 02:05:53.950 align:middle line:10%
to be the muscle
that's being tested.

02:05:53.950 --> 02:05:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And he could say, my name
is Ash, Ash, Ash, Sue.

02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Sue would break it open.

02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.840 align:middle line:90%
Sue would break it open.

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:00.140 align:middle line:90%
Ash would keep it tight.

02:06:00.140 --> 02:06:01.390 align:middle line:90%
Now you have to say your name.

02:06:01.390 --> 02:06:02.780 align:middle line:90%
You can't say my name is Ash.

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:03.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:05.390 align:middle line:90%
Just clearing that up, OK?

02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:06.190 align:middle line:90%
All right, yes.

02:06:06.190 --> 02:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you start with minor
issues and then work up

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:10.180 align:middle line:90%
to larger issues?

02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Doesn't matter.

02:06:11.170 --> 02:06:12.440 align:middle line:10%
It comes up, you do it.

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:13.240 align:middle line:10%
You clear it.

02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Now, it doesn't mean that
whatever word comes up,

02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:17.680 align:middle line:10%
you need to keep forgiving that
all day long today and tomorrow

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.540 align:middle line:10%
and the next day and write
them down and track that.

02:06:19.540 --> 02:06:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't do that because
you're just recreating.

02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:21.980 align:middle line:90%
It's done.

02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Let it be done.

02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Move on to the next
thing that comes up, OK?

02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:28.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It could be the same goal
with a couple of different

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:28.840 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> You could have different
emotions come up with it,

02:06:30.970 --> 02:06:31.840 align:middle line:90%
as well, yeah.

02:06:31.840 --> 02:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But when you come back and test
for the goal, if it's clear,

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:35.280 align:middle line:90%
go for it.

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.370 align:middle line:90%
Go on to something else.

02:06:36.370 --> 02:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't keep recreating
your issues

02:06:37.810 --> 02:06:39.268 align:middle line:84%
to have to work
through them, yeah.

02:06:39.268 --> 02:06:41.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you don't have a DVD
with these exercises, do you?

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.470 align:middle line:90%
>> DVDs with this exercise?

02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes, in the store on my website.

02:06:45.090 --> 02:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called
"BodyAwake" number one.

02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And it'll teach
you how to do that

02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
with other techniques
involved with it.

02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.370 align:middle line:10%
"BodyAwake" number one.

02:06:53.370 --> 02:06:54.960 align:middle line:10%
I think you guys
have an order form.

02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:57.045 align:middle line:10%
Did they pass that
out when you came in?

02:06:57.045 --> 02:06:58.920 align:middle line:10%
Let me just briefly go
over that for you just

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:01.212 align:middle line:10%
to let you know about some
other support materials that

02:07:01.212 --> 02:07:02.850 align:middle line:10%
are available for you.

02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody need one
that doesn't have one?

02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:09.540 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Lisa, if you can, yeah.

02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.725 align:middle line:90%
Awesome, thank you.

02:07:10.725 --> 02:07:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, thank you.

02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so right up here, let me see
if the BodyAwakes are on there.

02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.270 align:middle line:90%
They're not specifically.

02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So you can go to the website
and get "BodyAwake" one

02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:22.620 align:middle line:84%
specifically if
you want to learn

02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:25.400 align:middle line:90%
how to do that technique more.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:27.550 align:middle line:84%
No, it's "BodyAwake"
DVD number one.

02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's not on there.

02:07:28.350 --> 02:07:30.150 align:middle line:90%
We have other things, OK?

02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:31.785 align:middle line:84%
So you could write
that on the bottom,

02:07:31.785 --> 02:07:32.910 align:middle line:90%
and they'll send it to you.

02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Or you can go to the website
and order it, whichever way

02:07:35.550 --> 02:07:36.675 align:middle line:90%
you want to deal with that.

02:07:36.675 --> 02:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Lisa's going to be back
here to help you with things

02:07:38.850 --> 02:07:41.850 align:middle line:84%
if you're interested in
the coursework or any

02:07:41.850 --> 02:07:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:45.360 align:middle line:90%
Let me just go through this.

02:07:45.360 --> 02:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
These are some very easy
things to get involved just

02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
to learn a little bit more,
just to have exposure to that.

02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.520 align:middle line:84%
"108 Ways to Manifest
Your Magnificence"--

02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
I literally am just
giving you ideas.

02:07:55.350 --> 02:07:58.898 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can listen
to in the car or what have you.

02:07:58.898 --> 02:08:01.440 align:middle line:10%
It's also in a little book form
that you can open up anywhere

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:04.380 align:middle line:10%
and read those kinds of things,
just some fun things there.

02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:08.070 align:middle line:10%
The "AM-PM Meditation"
is definitely grounding.

02:08:08.070 --> 02:08:10.470 align:middle line:84%
After I had this big
awakening experience,

02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
the very first thing that I
felt compelled to do was I

02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:16.862 align:middle line:84%
woke up at 5 o'clock in
the morning and called--

02:08:16.862 --> 02:08:18.570 align:middle line:84%
I waited until a decent
hour to call him.

02:08:18.570 --> 02:08:20.487 align:middle line:84%
But one of my patients
was a recording artist.

02:08:20.487 --> 02:08:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And I knew he had a studio.

02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Jay,
there's something

02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:24.420 align:middle line:90%
that's good coming out.

02:08:24.420 --> 02:08:26.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I've got to
come and record something.

02:08:26.730 --> 02:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And he had it turned
on when I got there.

02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down,
and it was whoosh.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
It was just this total
download from this state.

02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And I've had more
comments on that

02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
than you would imagine over
the last 15 years or so.

02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
So many, many
things here for you.

02:08:46.210 --> 02:08:49.170 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to go
straight to the key that

02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
is so valuable for you.

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And that is the live events,
which I do have here in LA

02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and other cities
across the country.

02:08:58.170 --> 02:09:00.603 align:middle line:90%
There is a level one for that.

02:09:00.603 --> 02:09:02.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a support package
here that gives you

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
more information,
right under here,

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:07.340 align:middle line:84%
that's just a collection
of CDs and DVDs.

02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Oh, "BodyAwake" one is in that.

02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's right here.

02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:14.220 align:middle line:90%
It's under the second red bar.

02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
That little area has
a support package.

02:09:16.680 --> 02:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
And "BodyAwake" one is a DVD
that is in that and so is

02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:25.297 align:middle line:84%
the "AM-PM Meditation"
I'm seeing there.

02:09:25.297 --> 02:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's a great
collection of things

02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that would be an easy way
for you to plug in to getting

02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:31.337 align:middle line:90%
more practice with all this.

02:09:31.337 --> 02:09:33.420 align:middle line:84%
The next thing that I would
recommend that you do,

02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
which most people do,
is come to the level

02:09:36.090 --> 02:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%
one of the coursework.

02:09:38.190 --> 02:09:40.007 align:middle line:90%
And that is a three-day event.

02:09:40.007 --> 02:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.270 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just come
on Saturday and Sunday

02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
because on Friday, I start
the whole big quantum

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
conversation like what we
have been having here today.

02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's included if you
do want to come to the level

02:09:53.610 --> 02:09:54.580 align:middle line:90%
one of the coursework.

02:09:54.580 --> 02:09:55.380 align:middle line:90%
The--

02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.422 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's the difference
between the first one

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and the second one?

02:09:58.290 --> 02:09:59.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Where, what?

02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:01.060 align:middle line:10%
>> This one and this one.

02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:05.830 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, this up here
is CDs and DVDs.

02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:09.520 align:middle line:10%
This second one down
here is a live event, OK?

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the live event
that you come to.

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And if you purchase that
when you're at a live event,

02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:17.750 align:middle line:84%
like this one today, there's,
like, a $400 savings.

02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:20.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's normally $895.

02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:24.040 align:middle line:10%
It's $495 if you purchase it
while you're here because Lisa

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:25.300 align:middle line:10%
can take that back.

02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot easier
thing for us to administer.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.850 align:middle line:84%
So the next two,
there's one in Phoenix.

02:10:30.850 --> 02:10:32.950 align:middle line:90%
There's one in Salt Lake City.

02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Salt Lake City is
coming up pretty soon.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.120 align:middle line:90%
And then in the fall is Phoenix.

02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.830 align:middle line:10%
And I'll be back here in LA
after the first of the year.

02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:42.842 align:middle line:10%
So--

02:10:42.842 --> 02:10:44.610 align:middle line:10%
>> How long is the level one?

02:10:44.610 --> 02:10:45.940 align:middle line:10%
Oh, it's a two-day workshop

02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:47.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it's a
weekend workshop.

02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So it takes this,
and it's more detail?

02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Much more detail, much more.

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're barreling
through here in two hours.

02:10:53.730 --> 02:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's 9:00 to 6:00
and 9:00 to 4:00.

02:10:58.710 --> 02:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And you get the free day of
Friday, which is 9:00 to 4:00,

02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:03.000 align:middle line:90%
also.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot more time to
infuse lots more information

02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:08.858 align:middle line:90%
into the mix.

02:11:08.858 --> 02:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if you know
that this is something

02:11:10.650 --> 02:11:14.970 align:middle line:84%
that you are totally jazzed
by and you want to plug in,

02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:17.288 align:middle line:84%
many people just purchase
the whole package

02:11:17.288 --> 02:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
because of the savings
that's coming there.

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.800 align:middle line:10%
And it's a deep inquiry into
enlightenment and embodiment.

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.090 align:middle line:10%
It's about self-healing.

02:11:24.090 --> 02:11:26.040 align:middle line:10%
But it's much more than that.

02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It is ultimately
teaching you how

02:11:27.610 --> 02:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
to build the circuits
for self-illumination.

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I want the circuitry
in the system

02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to be there, where
the wobble is gone,

02:11:33.810 --> 02:11:35.820 align:middle line:84%
where we're stabilizing
vibrationally

02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
so that the third eye can
open so that we can start

02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:40.570 align:middle line:84%
to perceive ourselves as
the multidimensional beings

02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:43.898 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what it's all about.

02:11:43.898 --> 02:11:44.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm teaching.

02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, we have
to start somewhere.

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:48.960 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

02:11:50.070 --> 02:11:52.950 align:middle line:84%
If you have more questions about
that, Lisa's happy to answer.

02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be back there
afterward to help you, as well.

02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:57.093 align:middle line:84%
Let's flip it over, and
just let me show you

02:11:57.093 --> 02:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
a couple of more things
that are going on.

02:11:59.150 --> 02:12:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I also do healing
retreats where there is

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.760 align:middle line:90%
hands-on treatment happening.

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I have practitioners
that I've been training

02:12:05.850 --> 02:12:08.713 align:middle line:84%
and that have been working with
me for years, practitioners

02:12:08.713 --> 02:12:10.380 align:middle line:84%
that were trained by
my father, as well,

02:12:10.380 --> 02:12:12.780 align:middle line:90%
that are working with you.

02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching and
leading a whole healing,

02:12:14.670 --> 02:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
teaching you how to do
self-healing modalities

02:12:17.010 --> 02:12:19.312 align:middle line:90%
all day long.

02:12:19.312 --> 02:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you're also
getting some hands-on work

02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:22.650 align:middle line:90%
if you're interested in that.

02:12:22.650 --> 02:12:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And we just had one
in Evergreen, Colorado

02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:27.570 align:middle line:90%
in February.

02:12:27.570 --> 02:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And the next one is in
Indianapolis in August.

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.958 align:middle line:84%
And then next February,
we'll be back in Evergreen.

02:12:32.958 --> 02:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two locations
for the healing retreats

02:12:35.250 --> 02:12:36.600 align:middle line:90%
that we're currently doing.

02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:38.892 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that I want to
mention to you guys, which

02:12:38.892 --> 02:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I don't put on every
introductory order

02:12:41.070 --> 02:12:43.020 align:middle line:84%
form but I did for the
Conscious Life Expo

02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because of the nature of
the people that are here

02:12:46.410 --> 02:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
and the open-mindedness
that are here,

02:12:48.690 --> 02:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I also have a Sedona
retreat every year.

02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:54.720 align:middle line:10%
And at the Sedona
retreat, what I am doing

02:12:54.720 --> 02:13:00.720 align:middle line:10%
is speaking into the sacred
sites around the planet

02:13:00.720 --> 02:13:02.460 align:middle line:10%
and the technologies
that were obviously

02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:04.650 align:middle line:10%
involved in the building
of those sacred sites

02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:08.760 align:middle line:10%
and activating your own
DNA and returning you

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:13.980 align:middle line:10%
to conscious management of
your own DNA expression.

02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:17.730 align:middle line:90%
So it is ultimately about--

02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:21.240 align:middle line:84%
we explore ancient Lemuria
and ancient Atlantis

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:22.230 align:middle line:90%
and ancient Egypt.

02:13:22.230 --> 02:13:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And I have memories of these
places that awakened in me

02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
after this awakening occurred,
my opening of my third eye.

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And I do bring all of that
conversation into the mix.

02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
I also speak about what
happened in ancient Egypt,

02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
what Machu Picchu
was all about, what

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
the teachings in ancient
India were, in the scriptures

02:13:44.850 --> 02:13:47.580 align:middle line:84%
of the Vedas and the
Upanishads and the Sutras.

02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And I tie it all together
in a user-friendly way,

02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:52.750 align:middle line:84%
something that you
might be interested in.

02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I put it
on here because I

02:13:54.180 --> 02:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
thought I'd be dealing with
people that are open and awake.

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I just want to
support you in these ways.

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.640 align:middle line:10%
And so I normally keep that
for people who've already

02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:07.920 align:middle line:10%
engaged in the coursework,
and they're opening,

02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.087 align:middle line:10%
and they're starting to
build the circuits to manage

02:14:10.087 --> 02:14:10.920 align:middle line:10%
such things.

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But I'm really very
focused on hitting the road

02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
with this truth and
building circuits

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:21.480 align:middle line:84%
in our conscious community
as quickly as we can

02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
because the time
is obviously now.

02:14:24.920 --> 02:14:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful support to
what's happening for humanity.

02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's the Sedona.

02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And then also I wanted
to mention that Kashi

02:14:34.050 --> 02:14:36.000 align:middle line:90%
is an ashram in Florida.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a yoga silent
meditation retreat.

02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:41.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'm teaching you
some amazing concepts

02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:43.470 align:middle line:10%
about where Hinduism came from.

02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:46.230 align:middle line:10%
It's actually a user
manual on enlightenment.

02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:48.930 align:middle line:10%
The gods and goddesses are
part of your physiology.

02:14:48.930 --> 02:14:50.820 align:middle line:84%
The Ganesh, the
remover of obstacles,

02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:53.085 align:middle line:90%
is actually the primitive brain.

02:14:53.085 --> 02:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
If you take the brain up out of
the body and turn it like this,

02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it looks just like the
face of an elephant.

02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:00.330 align:middle line:10%
And the cerebellum is the ears.

02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:02.280 align:middle line:84%
The cortex is the
crown of Ganesh.

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The trunk of Ganesh
is the medulla.

02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:06.150 align:middle line:90%
The face of Ganesh is the pons.

02:15:06.150 --> 02:15:09.030 align:middle line:84%
All of this is part of
the primitive brain.

02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And Ganesh is considered
the removal of obstacles.

02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is when we
illuminate up past this point,

02:15:16.410 --> 02:15:18.935 align:middle line:84%
we don't see things
as obstacles anymore.

02:15:18.935 --> 02:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And so when we
invoke that, we're

02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:22.577 align:middle line:84%
invoking ourselves up
above the primitive brain.

02:15:22.577 --> 02:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I really want you
to get in my coursework

02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:27.060 align:middle line:84%
is that I'm teaching you
how to enlighten yourself.

02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm teaching you how to embody
your true higher self so

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:33.090 align:middle line:84%
that you have the
frequencies that

02:15:33.090 --> 02:15:35.130 align:middle line:90%
are required for enlightenment.

02:15:35.130 --> 02:15:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Healing happens as
a byproduct of that.

02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:38.320 align:middle line:10%
But that's really not the goal.

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.500 align:middle line:10%
The goal is much bigger
than just physical healing.

02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.240 align:middle line:10%
And so Kashi, I'm doing this.

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:50.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm sharing that Hanuman, who
was in service to the gods

02:15:50.910 --> 02:15:56.100 align:middle line:10%
of the systems, the Vishnu--

02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:57.850 align:middle line:10%
sorry.

02:15:57.850 --> 02:16:00.080 align:middle line:10%
Hanuman was in
service to Vishnu.

02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And it is actually a story about
the endocrine system and how--

02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:10.200 align:middle line:10%
because Hanuman was said to
be able to leap big spaces

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:13.780 align:middle line:10%
and fly and go into
tiny spaces, as well.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is about
the hormonal system

02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and how it saved
Sita from Lanka,

02:16:22.110 --> 02:16:25.800 align:middle line:90%
who was being held captive.

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:32.400 align:middle line:10%
All of this is the idea
that the hormonal system,

02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.790 align:middle line:10%
the endocrine system, has
the capacity to heal cancer.

02:16:35.790 --> 02:16:36.639 align:middle line:90%
It's right there.

02:16:36.639 --> 02:16:38.430 align:middle line:90%
It's all exactly there.

02:16:38.430 --> 02:16:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a matter
of igniting and lighting

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:42.990 align:middle line:90%
these vibrational frequencies.

02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
So just know that there is a
tremendous amount of access

02:16:46.530 --> 02:16:48.059 align:middle line:84%
to information
here that you might

02:16:48.059 --> 02:16:50.370 align:middle line:90%
be interested in exploring.

02:16:50.370 --> 02:16:51.955 align:middle line:90%
So I do that at Kashi Ashram.

02:16:51.955 --> 02:16:53.580 align:middle line:84%
We also do yoga a
couple of times a day

02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and have silent meditation
days and that kind of thing.

02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Lastly, I'll just say that
I teach a version of yoga

02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:02.070 align:middle line:10%
that I am referencing
as BodyAwake yoga.

02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:06.570 align:middle line:10%
As I launch my book
here, two weeks from now,

02:17:06.570 --> 02:17:09.780 align:middle line:10%
March 19, the very
next book that I'm

02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:12.840 align:middle line:10%
going to be bringing
forward is a book about yoga

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.450 align:middle line:10%
and the lost message of what
yoga was supposed to be.

02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:18.070 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be seating
consciousness in the body.

02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
becoming flexible.

02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:20.580 align:middle line:90%
You are spirit.

02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:21.330 align:middle line:90%
You are formless.

02:17:21.330 --> 02:17:23.538 align:middle line:84%
When you are in the body,
your body becomes flexible,

02:17:23.538 --> 02:17:24.902 align:middle line:90%
and it heals.

02:17:24.902 --> 02:17:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So just know that if
you have an interest

02:17:26.610 --> 02:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
there, that there's a
whole school of yoga that's

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:31.680 align:middle line:84%
associated with yoga
alliance, as well.

02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:33.469 align:middle line:84%
And you can become
a yoga teacher.

02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:35.969 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just learn how to
do these things for yourselves.

02:17:35.969 --> 02:17:37.302 align:middle line:90%
It's all about circuit building.

02:17:37.302 --> 02:17:38.639 align:middle line:90%
So I can't say more.

02:17:38.639 --> 02:17:39.639 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to say more.

02:17:39.639 --> 02:17:42.139 align:middle line:84%
But I have to try to respect
the schedule today and send you

02:17:42.139 --> 02:17:42.939 align:middle line:90%
guys off.

02:17:42.939 --> 02:17:44.219 align:middle line:90%
Now let me just remind you.

02:17:44.219 --> 02:17:46.788 align:middle line:10%
You learned about subject,
object, subject, yes?

02:17:46.788 --> 02:17:48.330 align:middle line:10%
You learned about
take it to the body

02:17:48.330 --> 02:17:49.705 align:middle line:10%
when you're in an
emotional state

02:17:49.705 --> 02:17:50.872 align:middle line:10%
that you don't like so much.

02:17:50.872 --> 02:17:53.247 align:middle line:10%
You're going to learn how to
embrace it not through story

02:17:53.247 --> 02:17:54.549 align:middle line:10%
but just through the energy.

02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:55.500 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
take it to the body

02:17:55.500 --> 02:17:56.510 align:middle line:10%
and see where the charge is.

02:17:56.510 --> 02:17:57.840 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to start
breathing up and down

02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:00.120 align:middle line:10%
the central channel and
seat yourself with the four

02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:02.245 align:middle line:10%
anchor points in your
central channel all the time.

02:18:02.245 --> 02:18:04.412 align:middle line:84%
You're going to take a
breath from beyond your body,

02:18:04.412 --> 02:18:06.059 align:middle line:84%
through your body,
to beyond your body.

02:18:06.059 --> 02:18:07.476 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to allow yourself

02:18:07.476 --> 02:18:09.840 align:middle line:84%
to start to animate the
subtle self, the true self,

02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:13.379 align:middle line:84%
the invisible you that has
created this physical you

02:18:13.379 --> 02:18:14.879 align:middle line:84%
and is driving it
through this life.

02:18:14.879 --> 02:18:16.980 align:middle line:84%
You're going to learn
how to let that happen.

02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:19.139 align:middle line:10%
And then we did this
muscle test to remove

02:18:19.139 --> 02:18:22.110 align:middle line:10%
subconscious interference that
is in the way, that is keeping

02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:25.170 align:middle line:10%
you from completely embodying.

02:18:25.170 --> 02:18:26.610 align:middle line:90%
We had a pretty awesome time.

02:18:26.610 --> 02:18:28.080 align:middle line:90%
We had a good conversation.

02:18:28.080 --> 02:18:31.799 align:middle line:84%
And we did all that in about
two hours and 15 minutes.

02:18:31.799 --> 02:18:33.389 align:middle line:90%
So thank you guys for your time.

02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:34.549 align:middle line:90%
It's been a great delight.

02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:39.139 align:middle line:90%
So I'll be in the back.

02:18:39.139 --> 02:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm happy to answer
questions for you

02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:43.850 align:middle line:90%
and help you on your way.

02:18:43.850 --> 02:18:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Blessings to you all.

02:18:44.930 --> 02:18:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Safe journeys.

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:46.600 align:middle line:90%
All right, yeah.

02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:50.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

02:18:50.350 --> 02:18:56.000 align:middle line:90%
