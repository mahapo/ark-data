00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a little
background on myself.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I am a physician
licensed in California.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.079 align:middle line:84%
I've been practicing
for 35 years.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I did my residency in University
of Illinois in Chicago.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:84%
While in my residency, I
witnessed my first miracle.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting
with a young girl.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:84%
She was dying of
end-stage hepatitis.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:90%
She was 17 years old.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.270 align:middle line:84%
She was from one of the
Jewish academies in Chicago.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the Academy
only had like 100 people.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that time, that
year, four of their class

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.205 align:middle line:90%
had died of rare diseases.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So they were kind of
questioning, like,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:90%
What's happening?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.372 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
about black magic.

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:54.830 align:middle line:84%
They were talking about whether
people were poisoning them.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.900 align:middle line:90%
They didn't know.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So what happened for me
was that when I first

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
examined this girl, as I
touched her with my stethoscope,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
something flew out of her body.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
it at the time.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:90%
But it went into my body.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Literally, my hands kind
of closed up like this.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And my body kind
of became ice cold.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
I almost fell out, almost
passed out on the floor.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what happened to me.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.180 align:middle line:84%
But I knew that something
really bad was inside of her,

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and that it had
transferred to me.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So I did manage to
get it out, luckily.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But I was, after that, really
skeptical of touching her.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really
want to touch her.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So about that time, the head of
the Jewish orthodox community

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:84%
in Chicago called the
head rabbi in Jerusalem.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And they went into one of
the ancient Jewish books.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And they found an
ancient Jewish remedy

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.180 align:middle line:90%
for healing end-stage hepatitis.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:90%
They called it yellow hepatitis.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:90%
It was about 3,000 years old.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Here we're in Chicago.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.570 align:middle line:90%
This is back in 1983.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, we
thought we were kind of--

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:90%
today, we've gone way past it.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But we thought we were
pretty good with medicine.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're losing this
child, a 17-year-old.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever
lose a 17-year-old,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050 align:middle line:84%
it breaks your heart more
than anything, the kids.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so they call the
head Jewish rabbi.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you have to bring
a box of doves into the ICU.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And you have to place
the doves on the belly

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:90%
button of the girl.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And if the dove pulls out the
disease, the dove will die.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
This is Talmudic wisdom.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.032 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very curious about that.

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm probably a bit
like you, right?

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
How many people would want to go
watch that that are in the room

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.540 align:middle line:10%
How many of you would
not want to watch that?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, you're like
most of the doctors.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.102 align:middle line:84%
None of the doctors wanted
to watch it except for me,

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and none of the nurses.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.393 align:middle line:84%
There was one nurse and one
doctor in the whole hospital

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:07.690 align:middle line:90%
that wanted to watch that.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, they came in.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:middle line:90%
They took a big dove.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.602 align:middle line:90%
They did the thing.

00:03:13.602 --> 00:03:15.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Were they turtle doves?

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good question.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I think they actually
were pigeons.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.467 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, I think it was a
big pigeon they put on there.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Because pigeons are
doves, by the way.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And they put it on her belly.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.314 align:middle line:90%
[PHONE RINGING]

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.285 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:34.217 align:middle line:90%
I'm very popular.

00:03:34.217 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had turned that off.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so weird.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
I'll try that again.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:84%
All right, so anyways,
the dove took one breath,

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
and the dove fell over dead.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
One breath, and it
shook, and it died.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that if that
thing that had jumped into me--

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not so little,
as you can see.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And it jumped into
a dove, you imagine

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:90%
what it did to the Dove.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So they went through 18
doves in three hours.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.910 align:middle line:84%
During that time, the nurse
kept adjusting the medicine.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:90%
She was on Levophed.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.399 align:middle line:84%
Levophed is a pressor, it
brings up the blood pressure.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.980 align:middle line:84%
On full dose Levophed, her
blood pressure was 60 over 0.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
the diastolic.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.780 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the three hours,
she had adjusted completely

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:90%
off the Levophed.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.760 align:middle line:84%
She was now 120 over
80 with no medicine.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
All vital signs had
come back to normal.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the doctors
came in the hospital and said,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
you are bringing psittacosis
into the hospital.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:90%
You need to get her out.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:90%
You need to get the doves out.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.500 align:middle line:90%
You need to get out.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:90%
They threw the rabbis out.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:90%
The rabbis left.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
create a problem.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:90%
The healing was not completed.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:90%
It was not completed.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
But whatever was in her was
gone and she was at peace.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:90%
So for me, it was mind blowing.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
I saw stuff that I had never
believed was possible before.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know
more about that.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to know why these
doves dying did more than all

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.922 align:middle line:84%
the cortisone and
antivirals and everything

00:05:19.922 --> 00:05:22.505 align:middle line:84%
that I had just spent four years
learning, five years learning

00:05:22.505 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So I made a decision to take my
boards early, which I passed.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.645 align:middle line:84%
Went out and began
traveling the world

00:05:30.645 --> 00:05:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and started with the
kahunas in Hawaii.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:84%
I went with the Philippine
psychic surgeons.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Went to the Tibetan masters,
Zen masters in Japan,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Hindu masters in Hindu temples
in Bombay, Puna in India and so

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
forth, and traveled
the world, looking

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.165 align:middle line:84%
for what I was hoping to
be the secret of healing.

00:05:55.165 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:84%
What I was really looking for
is why did those doves die.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really
wanted to know.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.970 align:middle line:84%
So after a long journey of that,
I opened my own school in 1990,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
began teaching a form
of energetic medicine,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:90%
which was very successful.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.220 align:middle line:90%
We had tremendous healing.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you the one
story that changed me out

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
of that system, because I think
it's really valuable to learn

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was living in
Sedona at the time.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And Sedona, as you may know,
is a place of channels.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Sedona's where there's
at least 1,000 channels

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:90%
and only one radio station.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a joke.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.160 align:middle line:84%
So this very, very good
channel, and he was very good,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:90%
saw this girl.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
She was bleeding vaginally.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And he told her that she was
having shamanic cleansing

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and that she didn't
need to see the doctor.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
She went through
that for six months.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.150 align:middle line:84%
At the end of six months,
she was in so much pain,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:90%
she came to see me.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:90%
We checked her out.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.840 align:middle line:84%
At that point, she had stage
four uterine carcinoma.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:84%
It had spread all over her
belly along with very, very

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:90%
heavy Candida.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And so between the two
of them, she was a mess.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.420 align:middle line:90%
And she was in a lot of pain.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is
we did a process

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.380 align:middle line:84%
where we started looking at
the energetics of her disease.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:90%
So here's her uterus.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And there were massive
tumors kind of spread

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:90%
all over the uterus.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we looked at
the energy, the light

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.380 align:middle line:84%
around the physical
disease, the light

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.670 align:middle line:84%
opened up into something like
a circle that looked like this.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And inside the circle, there was
a face that was not very nice.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And when we explored
the energy in the face,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.790 align:middle line:84%
the face turned out
to be her father.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Her father was in jail in
New York City for pornography

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and child abuse and child
molestation, apparently

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
had been molesting
her most of her life.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He was getting out in
February after 10 years.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
He had written her and said,
I'm coming back for you.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
And she was terrified.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:34.559 align:middle line:90%
So what we did, we did a system.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
This is back before
Sufi healing.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.669 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to get
this light and the farther

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
out of her system.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.390 align:middle line:90%
We were able to get him out.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And it took about
an hour or two.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
She was screaming at
the top of her lungs,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.640 align:middle line:90%
she was so terrified.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:90%
She got the energy out.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:90%
She got him out.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And within three weeks, the
entire cancer disappeared.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.597 align:middle line:84%
She went into
complete remission.

00:09:03.597 --> 00:09:06.082 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you see the light?

00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:08.065 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Her question is, how
do you see the light.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:90%
You can learn that.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:90%
You can learn to see the light.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Part of this system
is, when you get sick,

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.012 align:middle line:84%
you always have what I
call an energetic pattern.

00:09:19.012 --> 00:09:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, it's a little bit
hard to write on this board,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's moving
around a lot.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.870 align:middle line:84%
But you have an
energetic pattern.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.870 align:middle line:84%
That energy pattern is
always there in all diseases.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's cancer,
it's anything.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.290 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is you have
to find those patterns, OK?

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, this was the
work I was doing at the time.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And we had, like I said,
many, many healings

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:46.430 align:middle line:90%
with this process.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.270 align:middle line:84%
This all came out of basically
the Tibetan system of healing.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:90%
I was working with chakras.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I was working with subtle
bodies, the emotional body,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the mental body,
this type of thing,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
and working with clearing the
images or the pictures that

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.150 align:middle line:84%
were found in the
subtle patterns.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was very effective.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:90%
But in this case, she left.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Then she comes
back a year later.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.262 align:middle line:84%
And she's in stage
four cancer again.

00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It didn't work.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:90%
It didn't stay out.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
When I looked at the
light body, if you will,

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.160 align:middle line:84%
her light body had the
same basic pattern,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
but it was all red this time,
instead of the first time

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.585 align:middle line:90%
when it was more gray.

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So when I went
inside and I asked

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.930 align:middle line:84%
her and I said, what have you
done this last year, she said,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.360 align:middle line:90%
well, I went back to New York.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
I ran out of money.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So I took a job
in a topless bar.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, what I did
is I sold drinks with my body.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So after doing that
for a year, you

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.653 align:middle line:84%
can imagine what came
inside of her from wandering

00:11:12.653 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
around that bar and what
might have been hanging out

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.873 align:middle line:90%
in that bar.

00:11:15.873 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
A year later, she
had the disease.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So this time, we
released all of it again.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And within one month, all
the disease disappeared.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
She went into remission again.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:90%
And she went back to New York.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.710 align:middle line:90%
She should have known better.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
So she goes back to New York.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And she comes back a year later.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And she's in stage
four cancer again.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is when I
finally woke up.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what's
wrong with this picture.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Twice now, we've put her
into complete remission

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.492 align:middle line:84%
from a stage four,
and twice she returns.

00:11:53.492 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.540 align:middle line:84%
If you were me, what
would you be thinking?

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.122 align:middle line:90%
>> That she's still doing--

00:12:00.122 --> 00:12:01.372 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to clear the core.

00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to go deeper.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.362 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to go deeper.

00:12:03.362 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I haven't cleared the core
issue, that I missed something.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:90%
There was maybe some resistance.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.750 align:middle line:90%
So I started looking deeper.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And what occurred
to me was, was it

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.690 align:middle line:84%
possible that the
issue wasn't really

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
her father, all this
energy inside of her.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
The issue was her
need for having

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.180 align:middle line:84%
these type of experiences, and
that this need was drawing it

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:90%
back.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.778 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.778 --> 00:12:36.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there was
something inside of her

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
that was not right
in the sense that she

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:90%
was willing to sell her body.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
She was willing to
use her sexuality

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.520 align:middle line:90%
in a way that wasn't right.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.895 align:middle line:84%
It was causing
stage four cancer.

00:12:45.895 --> 00:12:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Her need for attention--

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Need for attention,
need for love.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:90%
That was my first thought.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
it turned out to be.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So I began looking
in that direction.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'll make a
long story short.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
When we got through all
this, what we actually found

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
was the issue was her
need to dominate men

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:90%
with her sexuality.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.640 align:middle line:84%
That's what it actually
turned out to be,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.930 align:middle line:90%
her need to dominate men.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:90%
This was her shadow.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.650 align:middle line:90%
So we got in.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We cleared her need
to dominate men

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.670 align:middle line:84%
because of whatever had
happened to her and taught her,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
rather than dominating men,
how to move into loving men.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened.

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The disease disappeared
and never came back.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I learned a
really important teaching,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:84%
which was that the energetic
patterns that cause disease are

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
actually predicated on hidden
needs that are connected

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:12.500 align:middle line:84%
to what I called
turbidities or shadow

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.760 align:middle line:84%
aspects of ourselves that
are operating in a way

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.966 align:middle line:90%
outside of divine will.

00:14:20.966 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that making sense?

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So what's divine will
in a relationship?

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:90%
Anybody here in a relationship?

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.700 align:middle line:84%
OK, what's divine will
in a relationship?

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional love for
your partner, right?

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
So would divine will include
dominating your partner

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:90%
for power?

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.600 align:middle line:84%
No, so if you had that going
on in your relationship,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.400 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:56.927 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.927 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, you'd
go get some therapy.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.620 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:07.600 align:middle line:84%
The divine will is
everything good, all right?

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Divine will is everything
good, all right?

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:90%
So why do we have divine will?

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.900 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
Why is divine will?

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.825 align:middle line:84%
What does the divine
want from you?

00:15:22.825 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
It wants you to be happy.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.202 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:15:27.202 --> 00:15:28.910 align:middle line:84%
It wants you to be an
expression of love.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
That's even more true, yes.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Good things for all people.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, close.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.944 align:middle line:84%
>> You want it to
be uniquely you.

00:15:39.944 --> 00:15:40.916 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:40.916 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
Actually, that's true.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.082 align:middle line:84%
But it even wants
something more than that.

00:15:47.082 --> 00:15:48.920 align:middle line:84%
>> To see the
divinity within it?

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.400 align:middle line:84%
The divine will
wants you to find

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.435 align:middle line:90%
the divine inside of yourself.

00:15:57.435 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.181 align:middle line:84%
So what is the divine
inside of ourself?

00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Live authentically.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Say again.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Live authentically.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Live authentically will
get you there, that's right,

00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
because if you're not
living truthfully,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
then you're not living truth.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.328 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not
living truth, how

00:16:18.328 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are you going to find
anything truthful, right?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.692 align:middle line:90%
You have to live authentically.

00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:24.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:90%
But what is your divine self?

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.735 align:middle line:90%
>> The godliness within you.

00:16:32.735 --> 00:16:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the
godliness within you.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.818 align:middle line:84%
But let me hear this
gentleman back here.

00:16:35.818 --> 00:16:38.298 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Spark of divinity.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, the spark of divinity,
in the Sufi tradition,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
is called the sirr.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you can
read this, S-I-R-R, sirr.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Sirr means the spirit.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit is the
inblown breath of God

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:13.000 align:middle line:84%
that has been blown into each
one of us and is identical.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So we are all brothers or
sisters or part of the one.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.490 align:middle line:90%
We are the same one.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You and I are the same, even
though we look different.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.240 align:middle line:84%
We've got the same
color clothes on.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.050 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the same
spirit inside of us--

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:90%
the spirit is the same.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So the spirit inside of each
person, the sirr, is the same.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And the spirit
wants us to discover

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the aspect of God that is
the spirit within each of us.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.770 align:middle line:10%
Now, how do you do that?

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.840 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Motivation.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:55.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Meditation.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:90%
Quieting the ego.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Meditation and quieting the ego
is a very good way to do that.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
That is certainly helpful,
but it's not enough.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:08.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Surrender to God's will.

00:18:08.998 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Who said that?

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>> You got two already.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.468 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:14.468 --> 00:18:15.400 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, she's got a
sheet back there.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:84%
You surrender to
God's will, right?

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.550 align:middle line:84%
If you are in the process of
surrendering to God's will,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the first step of
learning the process

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:34.433 align:middle line:84%
of coming into union with God
is surrendering into God's will.

00:18:34.433 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And quieting your mind is very
helpful, as well, of course.

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is
very helpful as well.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.730 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
you have to surrender.

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And in Sufism, we say
there are 99 names of God,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
such as Arahman
the compassionate,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and Arahim the
merciful, al-Qadus

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:90%
the holy, al-Latif the subtle.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So these 99 names of God all
come into the heart from God.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And the 99 names build
the light of the heart

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and build the temple of
God within the person.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.960 align:middle line:84%
If you've done your
work, and you're

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
working in your own process,
you are building the house

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%
of God inside of you every day.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:36.150 align:middle line:90%
So think about that.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.390 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It means that when
you learn compassion,

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
the light of
compassion gets built

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:84%
as a room inside of your heart,
and you become compassionate.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
When you learn mercy,
the light of mercy

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.180 align:middle line:84%
becomes built
inside of your heart

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a room of
mercy inside your heart.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.990 align:middle line:84%
When you learn love,
the light of love

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is built as a room
inside of your heart.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And when you learn
all 99 of these names,

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:84%
you have built the house of
God inside of your heart.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.930 align:middle line:10%
And when you build that house of
God inside of your heart, what

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:24.780 align:middle line:10%
happens is, when you complete
it, the essential light of God

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:10%
comes inside of you and
lives in your house.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And when you want to know
what a perfect master is,

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:84%
a perfect master as one who has
built that house, that temple.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And the light of God,
in its perfection,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:84%
comes and lives inside of
you and puts itself inside

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And you have reached the
full state of perfection.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:90%
Now you are a true master.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Just the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:59.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Names of God?

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:00.976 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:03.508 align:middle line:90%
Does that go to everybody?

00:21:03.508 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Are there people
that don't get that?

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody gets in.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what your path is.

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter who you are
or if you're a man or a woman.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a spirit.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:17.430 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a soul.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has a heart.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
Everybody has 99 names of God.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And those names of God have you
there been built inside of you,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.570 align:middle line:90%
or they haven't.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let me
take your question,

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
then we'll talk about
illness in a moment.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's possible
to restore anybody.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to
restore anybody.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, unless it's predestined
that that person is meant

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to do absolute evil, and
that's their incarnation,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
that's what they're here for.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Then that's another story.

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
But anybody else, yes.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.757 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
destined, they're

00:21:58.757 --> 00:21:59.840 align:middle line:90%
here for certain purposes.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
All right, now, this process
of building your temple inside

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:90%
of you is called walking.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.490 align:middle line:90%
We call this walking.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.840 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Walking means that every day,
God will put in front of you

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
something that will show you
something you need to learn.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it could be
needing to learn to walk.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it might be,
can I love my wife.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's, can
I respond with mercy

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.220 align:middle line:84%
rather than hurting somebody
or punching somebody

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:90%
or putting somebody down.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's, can I
be more subtle and aware

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.412 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on.

00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's just patience.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:90%
Can I deal with LA traffic?

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.108 align:middle line:84%
So you've had that
experience, right?

00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
There are times you're
having to experience

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.700 align:middle line:90%
different things in your life.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You see, what happens is
God puts in front of you

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and me and everybody else what
we need to build that house.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's going on
every single day.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Even if you think
it's not, it is.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is at
all times, God is present.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
At all times, God
is working to have

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
us remember that divine
spark within by building

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:90%
that house within.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And the way you
build the house is

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.665 align:middle line:84%
to walk through experiences
that open up those 99 qualities.

00:23:52.665 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Is that making sense?

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I was
going to teach you compassion,

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.416 align:middle line:90%
how would I teach it to you?

00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> By example.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Scenarios.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Say it again.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:90%
You got it, actually.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.595 align:middle line:90%
Say it.

00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I would put a difficult
person that you were not

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
compassionate about,
you're going to want to--

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you could learn to
accept them and ground and care

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.150 align:middle line:84%
for them and be

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And I can talk to you all
day long about it, right?

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you Buddha
was totally compassionate.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And I could tell you
that Mohammed was

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.220 align:middle line:90%

What's going to make
you compassionate

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.255 align:middle line:84%
is to have some guy in front of
you with some kind of trouble,

00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:47.880 align:middle line:84%
then you have to open
your heart and be

00:24:50.688 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:90%

OK, all right, so
this is how you learn.

This list learning of walking
through your experiences--

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
you have experiences that
God puts in front of you.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And you have to learn to walk
through those experiences,

How do you know when
you fall in love?

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.234 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever fallen in love?

00:25:42.234 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, a few times?

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Did you know it when
you were in love?

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you knew.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:90%
You know it.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.250 align:middle line:84%
When you're in it,
you will know it.

All right, now, as you
walk into this process

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
top of the list.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
There are worse ones like going
to jail and things like that,

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.600 align:middle line:90%
getting into accidents.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
There are some very strong
teachings people get.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But illness is one of
the keys to growth.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you
an example of this.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.343 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients, she
was a marathon runner.

>> Ultrathon.

00:26:36.443 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, ultra-marathoner,
Ironman or something like that.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.880 align:middle line:90%
They do swimming and--

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, triathlon.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Triathlon, thank you.

00:26:43.115 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:90%
She was a triathlon runner.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:90%
She was very good.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:10%
And she was also very
spiritual, but she

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:10%
kept pushing her
spirituality down,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:10%

This is how it works.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:10.680 align:middle line:84%
The way God works is God wants
you to remember to come home.

Eventually, it's raised
to the point of illness.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
When illness comes in,
illness is a statement by God

But if you don't do
it, the illnesses

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:57.400 align:middle line:84%
can drag on for
a very long time.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't do it at all,
yes, then you go to your doctor

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.750 align:middle line:10%
and you get surgery, or
you go to your doctor

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:10%
and you get some
anti-hypertensives,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:10%
or you go to your doctor
and you get some medicines.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And you will stay
on that medicine

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:84%

working, which you'll

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:15.070 align:middle line:90%

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.570 align:middle line:84%
But sooner or later,
it will stop working.

And when it does, your
time will be over.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But it comes back
to you, because you

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:90%
didn't follow the blueprint.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the blueprint is
that within every disease

is a silver lining.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And that silver
lining is the teaching

I'll give an example of this.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.820 align:middle line:90%
We had a child who had--

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.960 align:middle line:90%
what was it?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Glioblastoma.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.940 align:middle line:90%
You know what glioblastoma is?

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Brain tumor.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Most dangerous brain tumor
for a child there is.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much-- you know,
you can't treat it.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.230 align:middle line:84%
She had tried it, they tried
treatment, it didn't work.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.200 align:middle line:84%
She was, I think,
nine years old.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:90%
She was in Denmark.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:27.800 align:middle line:84%
At that time, they
called me, she

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:90%
was sleeping 23 hours a day.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get a
brain tumor, what it does

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:90%
is it puts you to sleep.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.400 align:middle line:90%
Puts you out.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So she was sleeping
23 hours a day.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.415 align:middle line:90%
She'd stopped eating.

00:30:37.415 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't get
any food down to her.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
They gave her about a
month or two to live,

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.910 align:middle line:90%
and she was on her way out.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So the mom called me
from Denmark and said,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.850 align:middle line:90%
can you work on healing her?

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.070 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, let's try it.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is
we essentially--

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
here was the tumor.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.070 align:middle line:90%
The tumor-- this was the girl.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.275 align:middle line:90%


00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:90%
Sorry for my writing.

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:04.382 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a very good artist.

00:31:04.382 --> 00:31:05.840 align:middle line:84%
But she kind of
did look like that.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.710 align:middle line:90%
She was not feeling very good.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
The tumor was a
large more sitting

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.560 align:middle line:90%
in the back of the cerebellum.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And she was-- you
know, it was end stage.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:23.690 align:middle line:84%
So what we did is we looked at
the pattern of light around--

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
well, what we really did
first is we went to God.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.900 align:middle line:90%
And we said, God, we need help.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:32.160 align:middle line:84%
And we asked God to
show us, in the field,

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
what was causing the
problem of the tumor.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:41.580 align:middle line:84%
God illuminated something
up here in the field,

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.995 align:middle line:90%
and it was sort of--

00:31:43.995 --> 00:31:45.750 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
exactly anymore now,

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.792 align:middle line:84%
but whatever it was, it
was something like a very

00:31:47.792 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:90%
shadowy light up there.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And we went into it, and when
we opened it up, what we found

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:84%
was the images of her,
mother and her father

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:90%
screaming at each other.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:90%
So I asked the parents about it.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.050 align:middle line:84%
It turned out they were
going through a divorce.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.480 align:middle line:90%
The mom was divorcing the dad.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.410 align:middle line:84%
She said that bad was no
good, he was worthless,

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.170 align:middle line:84%
he was not doing the
things he should have done.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:90%
He was bad.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.060 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't following the way.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:20.290 align:middle line:84%
The father was
crying, I love her.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I want her, I'll do
anything to be with her.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.240 align:middle line:90%
She doesn't want me.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The two of them
were at each other.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:84%
The child couldn't
handle it, and something

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.160 align:middle line:90%
broke inside the child's mind.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Inside of its brain.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.880 align:middle line:84%
That break of the parents
fighting each other--

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.890 align:middle line:90%
it was happening right here.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.957 align:middle line:84%
Here was the mom,
and here was the dad,

00:32:42.957 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:90%
and they were going at it.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we understood that this
was the first case, we went in,

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and using these 99 names of
God, and the light of God,

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.980 align:middle line:90%
we were able to erase--

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.130 align:middle line:90%
resolve the problem here.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And we were able to bring
the parents back together.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:04.410 align:middle line:84%
It took four hours of work--
four sessions over about a two

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:90%
week period of time.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
four hours, the child

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:84%
woke up, got out of
bed, returned to school,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and began her studies again.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When you say down
that dark shadow--

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:33:23.382 --> 00:33:26.826 align:middle line:84%
>> How-- what method-- would
you use it telephatically,

00:33:26.826 --> 00:33:28.794 align:middle line:90%
spiritually?

00:33:28.794 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:90%
What you do?

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The way we do it, and the
way we teach people to do it,

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.500 align:middle line:84%
because this is
a Sufi teaching--

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Sufism is about getting--

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Sufism is the process
of purification

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.740 align:middle line:84%
of the heart to
build the temple,

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.130 align:middle line:90%
so God can live inside of you.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.420 align:middle line:84%
The way we do it is we teach
you to access the light of God

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:54.650 align:middle line:84%
directly, then to shine that
light of God on whatever you're

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:90%
looking at.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.760 align:middle line:90%
In this case, the tumor.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.610 align:middle line:84%
When the light hits
the tumor, what happens

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
is it reflects off
whatever the issue is,

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:07.030 align:middle line:90%
and it shows you its cause.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.980 align:middle line:10%
Or another way of
saying it, it shows

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:10%
you the truth of the issue.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.940 align:middle line:90%
All the above.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.740 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.429 align:middle line:84%
Hear it, see it,
know it, taste it.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Can vary.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.710 align:middle line:84%
In this case, I tend
to be more of a seer.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But some people are more
listeners, and knowers,

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.340 align:middle line:90%
and things.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.699 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:28.900 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
You can communicate with
it, you can talk to it.

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But in all cases that
I've worked with,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.960 align:middle line:84%
inside of every illness is
images that are communicating,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.239 align:middle line:84%
and those images, like the
mother and the father fighting,

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:48.050 align:middle line:90%
cause a problem in the person.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.840 align:middle line:84%
The problem in the
child was that she

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:90%
couldn't handle the discord.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It broke something
inside of her.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.767 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't strong enough
to be able to handle--

00:34:56.767 --> 00:34:59.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, I don't know if it was
a combination of the mother's

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.780 align:middle line:84%
aggression, the
father falling down,

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and the electronegativity
between the two of them.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:06.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:08.655 align:middle line:84%
When you resolve--
and this is what

00:35:08.655 --> 00:35:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying-- once you find
it with the light of God,

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and you resolve it, 90% of the
time, the illnesses disappear.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Or slowly disappear.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.870 align:middle line:90%
Why is it slow?

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Because frequently,
as in this case,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:25.840 align:middle line:90%
it's not one set of images.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.765 align:middle line:84%
There is another set,
and there's another set,

00:35:27.765 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and there's another set,
and there's another.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I call those the
petals of the problem.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.600 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go
inside yourself,

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and you have to find out
what's causing your problem.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.970 align:middle line:84%
If you're depressed, if
you're schizophrenic,

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.220 align:middle line:84%
if you're manic
depressive, if you're--

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.020 align:middle line:90%
you name it.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.670 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.520 align:middle line:84%
You go inside, and you find
out what your issue is.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're having trouble, you
can't find a relationship,

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:90%
you have relationship-itis.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:90%
You're having a problem.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.350 align:middle line:90%
You can't find a relationship.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:01.600 align:middle line:90%
What's going on inside of you?

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.400 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not because there's
nobody out there for you.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.970 align:middle line:90%
The problem is inside of you.

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not out there.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.450 align:middle line:90%
It's in here.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So you go, and you go to God,
you shine the light of God

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.330 align:middle line:84%
on why you can't
have a relationship,

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and you will find, inside
of yourself, something.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.240 align:middle line:84%
So for example, one woman, she
was wanting to get married.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.250 align:middle line:84%
She was having-- she
couldn't find it.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.000 align:middle line:84%
She had been in a gay
relationship for a while

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.260 align:middle line:90%
with another woman.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Things weren't
working out there.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.045 align:middle line:90%
She decided to go back to men.

00:36:36.045 --> 00:36:38.170 align:middle line:84%
She went back to the men,
she wanted to find a man.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.090 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't find one.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:90%
We shined the light on her.

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:46.520 align:middle line:84%
What we saw was her
rage at her father.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.930 align:middle line:90%
And she had reasons for that.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, she resolved it.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Over a weekend, she got to the
root of it, she resolved it,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and within three weeks she met
her husband and got married.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
core, and you change it,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.740 align:middle line:90%
you change your reality.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.190 align:middle line:90%
That's the secret.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.070 align:middle line:90%
It's the secret of life.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.900 align:middle line:84%
If you're having
trouble with work--

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
you're not making--
you know, you

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:90%
don't have the success you want.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.452 align:middle line:84%
I won't say you're not
making the money you want,

00:37:17.452 --> 00:37:19.327 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we
don't make what we want.

00:37:19.327 --> 00:37:21.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not having
success in your life,

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.840 align:middle line:84%
you go inside yourself, you will
find the answer inside of you.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not out there.

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It's in you.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.103 align:middle line:84%
There's something
going on inside of you.

00:37:33.103 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And I've told this story many
times to people who know me,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.350 align:middle line:90%
but this man came.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.422 align:middle line:84%
He was wanting to
make some money.

00:37:40.422 --> 00:37:41.880 align:middle line:84%
He was having
trouble making money.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.170 align:middle line:90%
He was an artist.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:50.277 align:middle line:84%
He made these massive murals,
like, 10 feet by 15 feet.

00:37:50.277 --> 00:37:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Couldn't sell any of them.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:90%
They were beautiful.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.800 align:middle line:84%
He came to me, he said,
Dr. Jaffe, what's going on?

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.705 align:middle line:84%
OK, we shined the light
of God inside of him.

00:37:58.705 --> 00:38:00.330 align:middle line:84%
What do you think we
saw inside of him?

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.190 align:middle line:90%
It was so interesting.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Wax?

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.260 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.060 align:middle line:90%
Lack?

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.390 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about lack.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:08.330 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't lack at all, which
you would have thought.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.400 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.870 align:middle line:90%
What we saw was--

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:22.910 align:middle line:84%
When he shined the light in
him, he saw a picture of--

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:23.780 align:middle line:90%
what do you call it?

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:28.530 align:middle line:84%
A Christian pilgrim with a
massive cross on his back,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:90%
bent over, carrying the cross.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.260 align:middle line:84%
What you think
that meant to him?

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.510 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian-- in
some Christian sects,

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the way to get to
God is to suffer.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.510 align:middle line:90%
To carry the cross.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And the more-- if you
want to reach heaven,

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.520 align:middle line:84%
you've got to carry the
burden of Christ on your back,

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:90%
and you have to suffer.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you have
money, you don't have

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:84%
to carry the burden of
Christ on your back,

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.720 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get to Heaven.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:84%
So once he understood that that
had been programmed into him

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:90%
very early, we looked at that.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you
think that's true?

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that you have
to suffer to get to God?

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.940 align:middle line:90%


00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a trick question.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to go through your
suffering to get to God,

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:28.630 align:middle line:84%
but you don't have
to carry the cross,

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and just only beat yourself
with it to get to God.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not about beating yourself.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.530 align:middle line:84%
You beat yourself
up enough already.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:37.090 align:middle line:90%
You know, life beats us up.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
beat yourself up.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.880 align:middle line:84%
What we have to do is we have
to go through the lessons

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.830 align:middle line:90%
that God has given to us?

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:46.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.500 align:middle line:90%
Like the patience of Job.

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:51.717 align:middle line:84%
You have to be patient until
you learn the patience,

00:39:51.717 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and then you come
out of your illness.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Or-- who is the one?

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.360 align:middle line:90%
Jonah.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.400 align:middle line:90%
You know the story of Jonah?

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Jonah ran away.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%
He was supposed to be a prophet.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.390 align:middle line:84%
He ran away from his calling
because he was afraid.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.910 align:middle line:84%
He went to the ocean,
he jumped in the ocean.

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.190 align:middle line:90%
He got on a boat.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:10.310 align:middle line:90%
They got out to sea.

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.390 align:middle line:84%
God did not like that
he was running away.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:14.190 align:middle line:90%
He sent a very ill wind.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.990 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:90%
The sailors meditated on it.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They realized that
the problem was Jonah.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Jonah knew it himself.

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I don't
want you to die.

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:25.490 align:middle line:84%
He jumped off the boat in
the middle of the ocean,

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:28.010 align:middle line:90%
was swallowed by the whale.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But when did the
whale spit him out?

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Six months later.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Because he got his lesson,
which was don't run away.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.210 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:39.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:41.876 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.220 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, anyways, this man healed
this issue with the cross

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:49.520 align:middle line:90%
on his back.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.633 align:middle line:84%
He realized that he didn't need
to have that type of suffering.

00:40:52.633 --> 00:40:54.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't need to
carry the cross.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.540 align:middle line:84%
He needed to be
joyful, and be happy,

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.050 align:middle line:90%
and face what God gave him.

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:00.080 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have to
walk around suffering.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.850 align:middle line:84%
He made the decision to make
that shift, and within--

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:09.200 align:middle line:84%
again, three weeks of the
healing, La Jolla Galleries

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.730 align:middle line:84%
called him, took all
of his paintings,

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and put them on sale, ranging
from $10,000 to $40,000 apiece.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And he did very well.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.438 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what's the
teaching, everyone?

00:41:22.438 --> 00:41:26.342 align:middle line:90%


00:41:26.342 --> 00:41:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> So you get the 99 idea--

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The secret's inside of you.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It's inside of-- your lives
work or don't work based on two

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.000 align:middle line:90%
things--

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:84%
what God sends you to
teach you, and your ability

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:45.330 align:middle line:84%
to walk through it, and
deal with it, and face it,

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:84%
or to turn away from it,
and run away from it,

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and then you have to deal with
the results of running away.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, running away could
mean suppressing it.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It could mean taking it
out in a negative way.

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.780 align:middle line:84%
It could mean, you
know, drinking alcohol

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.750 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to
deal with your pain.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Or taking drugs, so you don't
have to deal with your pain.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Becoming addicted.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.770 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of ways of
not dealing with your life.

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Any sort of illnesses,
or can it be, like--

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.199 align:middle line:90%


00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:21.999 align:middle line:90%
accidents?

00:42:21.999 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:23.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:24.680 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.585 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing, it's like,
once you realize it, and you--

00:42:29.585 --> 00:42:34.680 align:middle line:84%
it's all-- the whole life
is here for one reason.

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.210 align:middle line:90%
God wants you to come back.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:39.540 align:middle line:84%
If you need to have an accident
because that's the only way

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:44.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wake up, then
sometimes that's what happens.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, but it's not that-- we
don't have to be afraid.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no need to be afraid.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:55.050 align:middle line:84%
What there is is to know that
ultimately, the divine is

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.720 align:middle line:90%
merciful, and loving.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.420 align:middle line:90%
So it's not-- it's kind of--

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.350 align:middle line:90%
how many are parents in here?

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:09.870 align:middle line:84%
OK, when your kids do something
not right, what do you do?

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.000 align:middle line:90%
You try to discipline them.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And if they keep doing things
not right, what do you do?

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:15.720 align:middle line:90%
The discipline goes up, right?

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.310 align:middle line:90%


00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:43:19.110 --> 00:43:20.310 align:middle line:90%
Eventually you do something.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.300 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, right?

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Or you don't, and
the gets in trouble.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is
that God is ultimately

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.350 align:middle line:84%
merciful and compassionate
of all things.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:35.460 align:middle line:84%
There's always mercy and
love from God, always.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.460 align:middle line:84%
At all times, there's
merciful and love from God.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:42.570 align:middle line:84%
And the way to access
that mercy and love

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:47.170 align:middle line:84%
is by having a relationship
with God directly.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:47.970 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.950 align:middle line:90%
In other words, as you face--

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.320 align:middle line:90%
as you-- like for me, each day--

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.270 align:middle line:84%
really, each moment, even as I'm
teaching you, I'm in relation--

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to you, but I'm
in relationship with God

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.235 align:middle line:90%
each moment.

00:44:01.235 --> 00:44:02.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
I'm talking to you,

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:84%
but I'm listening
to the light of God,

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's guiding me, hopefully,
on what is right for you.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So even though I'm teaching
you, it's really behind it.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really me listening
to the light of God,

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's really God teaching
you through me, because I'm

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.600 align:middle line:90%
trying to listen to it.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.424 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal of spirituality.

00:44:28.424 --> 00:44:32.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, spirituality isn't
only seeing the auras,

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and isn't only manifesting,
and it isn't only--

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, whatever,
that people want to do.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality is
refining your heart,

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning what's
inside of you,

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:52.020 align:middle line:84%
so that you become
beautiful in the way of God.

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful in the
way of compassion.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful in the way of mercy.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful in the way of wisdom.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful in the way of love.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that carry
that become divine servants.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And divine servants is
what God is looking for.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.720 align:middle line:84%
God wants every one of
you to be divine servants.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You all have the
capacity for it.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.790 align:middle line:90%
There's nobody here who doesn't.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:84%
The only reason we don't do it
is because we get distracted,

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.280 align:middle line:84%
or we let our
desires take us over,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.850 align:middle line:84%
or we spend our lives
running after money,

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.910 align:middle line:84%
or running after something,
until all of a sudden,

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.610 align:middle line:84%
right, you hit your
50s, and your 60s,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and you realize time
is getting short.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.320 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.650 align:middle line:90%
So this-- what?

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.059 align:middle line:90%
Naw, it's OK.

00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:40.859 align:middle line:90%
That's all right.

00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:44.691 align:middle line:84%
>> Question, how do you know
if the energy is not external?

00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:46.607 align:middle line:84%
Like, multidimensional
or something

00:45:46.607 --> 00:45:51.766 align:middle line:84%
leaching off of our own energy
and causing the disease?

00:45:51.766 --> 00:45:53.194 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure--

00:45:53.194 --> 00:45:55.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Like, for example, if
you go through a trauma,

00:45:55.574 --> 00:45:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and those images
are there, and the--

00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.728 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's also
entities external to us.

00:46:03.728 --> 00:46:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, that suck off
of it, and live off of it.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.987 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel they're
there, but they're

00:46:07.987 --> 00:46:09.830 align:middle line:84%
having a good time
off of your suffering.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know
that is not that?

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.206 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually in the
image, but it's-- you know,

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of layered.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It is layered.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you're right.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:24.990 align:middle line:84%
But even if-- let's say you have
an entity living off of you.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:27.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, and there are
such things, of course.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And there are beings
that do that, right?

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:35.610 align:middle line:84%
But here's the question--
is the problem here,

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.700 align:middle line:90%
or is the problem here?

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The reason the entity
can leech off of you

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:48.708 align:middle line:84%
is because you have an opening
in yourself that allows that.

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:52.650 align:middle line:90%
I have a 27-year-old daughter.

00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:55.980 align:middle line:84%
She's very psychic,
and for a long--

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.230 align:middle line:84%
she was living in
Jordan for a while.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.200 align:middle line:84%
She wanted to learn Arabic,
so she was living in Jordan.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.780 align:middle line:84%
And in Jordan, if you
know, the desert--

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the desert have what
are called djinn.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what djinns are?

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:12.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, djinns are beings
made of essential fire.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.990 align:middle line:84%
They're not made
of clay, like us.

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.240 align:middle line:84%
They're made of fire, and they
live in hot places, usually.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And they can be extremely
wise, or they can be, you know,

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.050 align:middle line:84%
normal, or they
can be malevolent.

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.000 align:middle line:84%
She was having malevolent
djinn that were bothering her.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:84%
But when we got
to the root of it,

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.170 align:middle line:84%
we saw inside that
she was terrified

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that she wasn't strong
enough to stand up to them.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And so she was letting
them attack her.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:45.353 align:middle line:84%
When she found her strength
inside, the djinns ran away.

00:47:45.353 --> 00:47:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't get attacked.

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:49.542 align:middle line:84%
But she had to find her
strength before they left.

00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So was the issue the
djinn attacking her?

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.090 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.120 align:middle line:84%
The issue was,
really, God saying,

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:56.973 align:middle line:84%
it's time for you to
find your strength,

00:47:56.973 --> 00:47:59.140 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to send a few
djinn to kind of shake up

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.060 align:middle line:84%
your bed at night,
so you get scared,

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.380 align:middle line:90%
and then make you strong.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Which she did, and
she passed her test,

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and now she's not
afraid of anything.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I have two questions.

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.230 align:middle line:84%
One is with us being bombarded
with all these poisons

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.526 align:middle line:84%
in our food, in the
air, and pesticides

00:48:17.526 --> 00:48:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that is making our bodies
and our immune systems weak.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --which, of course,
brings on disease.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.350 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:29.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, her statement is if
our whole world is toxic,

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:32.705 align:middle line:84%
and we're weakening our
system, yes, all disease

00:48:32.705 --> 00:48:35.130 align:middle line:90%
is toxicity of some kind.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.145 align:middle line:84%
So if you-- you have
to do what you can.

00:48:38.145 --> 00:48:40.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you live in LA, so
you're breathing the air here,

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.150 align:middle line:90%
you're not getting out of that.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But you can certainly
have good water,

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and you can have
good food, right?

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And be careful about things
like living under high tension

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:51.570 align:middle line:90%
wires, and things like that.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can make changes
that will help you.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:57.204 align:middle line:84%
Or you can just leave LA
if you get really sick.

00:48:57.204 --> 00:49:02.174 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing is I see, at
least with maybe the elderly,

00:49:02.174 --> 00:49:08.138 align:middle line:84%
but even middle-aged people,
there's such a surge of hip

00:49:08.138 --> 00:49:11.120 align:middle line:90%
replacements, knee replacements.

00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:13.620 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think it's
up right now as a whole,

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:21.860 align:middle line:84%
but all these diseases
have to do with suppression

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.290 align:middle line:90%
of emotions.

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:26.600 align:middle line:84%
That people-- particularly
joint diseases,

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.360 align:middle line:84%
are usually suppressed emotions
that go into the joints.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Particularly anger.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.430 align:middle line:84%
or any of these type
of joint-itises,

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.160 align:middle line:84%
you've probably stuck your anger
in the hip, or in your knee,

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.960 align:middle line:90%
or--

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.418 align:middle line:84%
you know, what's
anger in the knee?

00:49:42.418 --> 00:49:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's really a desire
to kick somebody.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:47.185 align:middle line:90%
But you're not kicking them.

00:49:47.185 --> 00:49:47.985 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.600 align:middle line:84%
All right, let me take this
one first, then I'll come here.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.754 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:49:52.754 --> 00:49:56.051 align:middle line:84%
A little further on
this lady's question,

00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:57.470 align:middle line:90%
when she talked about entities.

00:49:57.470 --> 00:50:00.876 align:middle line:84%
What about witchcraft,
sorcery, psychic attacks?

00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:05.653 align:middle line:84%
You know, the CIA
has their ability

00:50:05.653 --> 00:50:09.872 align:middle line:84%
to direct electronic
attacks right now to you,

00:50:09.872 --> 00:50:11.540 align:middle line:90%
but even the source of--

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:13.854 align:middle line:90%
It's going on big time.

00:50:13.854 --> 00:50:14.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time.

00:50:14.702 --> 00:50:15.550 align:middle line:90%
Especially here in LA.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.383 align:middle line:90%
>> Especially in LA.

00:50:16.383 --> 00:50:17.600 align:middle line:90%
Especially in California.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.517 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot-- it's going
on in a lot of places.

00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:21.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot in San
Francisco, also.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:22.860 align:middle line:90%
It's happening a lot.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day, the
way you deal with that stuff

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:90%
is by standing in the light.

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And your light, and
your standing with God,

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:39.350 align:middle line:84%
is stronger than any witch,
any sorcerer, any antichrist--

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:40.760 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.850 align:middle line:84%
God is ultimately
the ultimate power.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.400 align:middle line:84%
He's the [INAUDIBLE],,
means unstoppable.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, OK, I
appreciate your answer.

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:52.455 align:middle line:84%
My question is, as a
healer, if someone comes in

00:50:52.455 --> 00:50:54.252 align:middle line:84%
and they have cancer,
whatever they have--

00:50:54.252 --> 00:50:55.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:50:55.052 --> 00:51:00.268 align:middle line:84%
>> And-- I don't know if in your
repertoire, if you read this--

00:51:00.268 --> 00:51:01.244 align:middle line:90%
I'm a healer.

00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:02.708 align:middle line:90%
I read it all the time.

00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:07.100 align:middle line:84%
I see 80% of the time my
clients have witchcraft.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually where
nobody can help you,

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.563 align:middle line:84%
nobody can find-- doctors
can't find anything.

00:51:11.563 --> 00:51:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, then, you know--

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.789 align:middle line:84%
>> --the curses and the
hexes, and all those things.

00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:17.414 align:middle line:84%
So in your repertoire,
do you see that?

00:51:17.414 --> 00:51:19.890 align:middle line:90%
Have you met it?

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
as a Sufi, you know,

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.630 align:middle line:84%
what we do is there
are sacred prayers.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, we surround the
person with the sacred prayers,

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and we build the sacred
light of God around them.

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.550 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, after we
do that, we then--

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.730 align:middle line:84%
there are ways to
confront the entities,

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and actually force
them to leave.

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So if we find the entities,
we force them straight on,

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.610 align:middle line:84%
we face them using
certain ways of doing it,

00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.215 align:middle line:90%
and we ask them to leave.

00:51:49.215 --> 00:51:50.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What if it's a curse?

00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.453 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:51:51.453 --> 00:51:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but even
if it's a curse,

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:54.640 align:middle line:90%
the curse comes from somebody.

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.440 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:59.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can find the source
of that curse, wherever it is,

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and you can face it.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And also, if you
go to God directly,

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and you ask God to take
care of that curse,

00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.370 align:middle line:84%
God can take a curse off
somebody in a second.

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.370 align:middle line:84%
A curse-- you know, God can
do anything, if God wants.

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And a curse is a small potatoes
compared to what's possible.

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So don't get caught in
the fear of these things,

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:90%
because ultimately--

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.980 align:middle line:90%
you know, I joke about this.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.300 align:middle line:84%
I was over in Rohnert Park,
which is up near where I live,

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:29.240 align:middle line:90%
in Sonoma.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
late night movie--

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.200 align:middle line:84%
like, 1:00 in the morning,
I go into the restroom.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
there were, like,

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.270 align:middle line:90%
10 guys around in the restroom.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't occur to me that
they might have been a gang.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:44.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, it just
wasn't in my mind.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So I walk in the restroom,
and all of a sudden,

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I realize that I am going to get
either mugged, knifed, or shot.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.460 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't sure which it was.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Or maybe all three.

00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this is
why I'm standing

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.430 align:middle line:90%
there doing a man's thing.

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very
uncomfortable moment for me.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking to myself, how
am I going to deal with this?

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.390 align:middle line:90%
And I thought-- I said, God--

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.420 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't really
want to be knifed or shot.

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.360 align:middle line:90%
Can you help me out?

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.240 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the door
to the restroom opens--

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and the door is about as
high as that door back there.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.000 align:middle line:90%
This guy walks in.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.910 align:middle line:84%
He ducks his head
under the door--

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.760 align:middle line:84%
so that puts him up
about 7 and 1/2 feet.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.390 align:middle line:90%
He was very, very big.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.110 align:middle line:84%
He walks next to me,
and he shakes his head

00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:39.650 align:middle line:84%
like he's just, like,
kind of waking up,

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and he comes, and he
stands next to me.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And these guys started, you
know, talking nervously.

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:46.740 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the
door opens again.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:51.870 align:middle line:84%
His twin walked in,
ducked under the door,

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:56.520 align:middle line:84%
came and stood next
to me on this side.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, and they were,
like, a long line of--

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:01.470 align:middle line:90%
anyways.

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.670 align:middle line:84%
These guys, all 10 of
them, looked at these guys,

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:90%
ran out of the restroom.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.440 align:middle line:84%
These guys never said
one word, they never

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.380 align:middle line:84%
looked at each other, they
never talked to anyone.

00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.450 align:middle line:84%
They just stopped, they
turned, and they walked out,

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:18.519 align:middle line:90%
and it was over.

00:54:18.519 --> 00:54:20.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels.

00:54:20.291 --> 00:54:23.252 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm 100% sure
that's what they were.

00:54:23.252 --> 00:54:26.626 align:middle line:84%
>> My son has had that
kind of experience before,

00:54:26.626 --> 00:54:33.255 align:middle line:84%
where a man was beating up
on a girl in a parking lot,

00:54:33.255 --> 00:54:34.338 align:middle line:90%
and then other guys came--

00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:35.610 align:middle line:90%
>> And helped him out?

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> He came over, and he did get
his windshield busted after he

00:54:39.590 --> 00:54:45.290 align:middle line:84%
got out of the store, but
he protected the girl.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Your son did that?

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:48.092 align:middle line:90%
He's a big guy.

00:54:48.092 --> 00:54:48.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Big guy?

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That's good.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
blessing and mercy.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And he's [INAUDIBLE], too.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:55.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:56.690 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're interested
in learning this system,

00:54:59.870 --> 00:55:02.420 align:middle line:90%
this is what we can offer you.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.840 align:middle line:84%
This I call medical spiritual
healing, this whole process.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:11.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of
applying the following.

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The first step is learning
this godly connection.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.380 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
steps of that.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:23.210 align:middle line:84%
We say there are
seven stations of it.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.040 align:middle line:84%
The first station
is purification

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.970 align:middle line:90%
of the personality, the self.

00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:31.350 align:middle line:84%
The second, the heart, and
finding God in the heart,

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.150 align:middle line:90%
and the angels.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:35.000 align:middle line:84%
The third is the soul,
finding the illumination.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.740 align:middle line:90%
The fourth is finding--

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:40.700 align:middle line:84%
we say the truth, the
hakika, enlightenment, unity.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.010 align:middle line:84%
The fifth we call
[INAUDIBLE],, is

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.020 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of
one's return back

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.490 align:middle line:90%
from the enlightened state.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Six is pure gnostic
revelation, where

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:52.310 align:middle line:84%
you're living absolutely in the
complete understandings of God.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And seven is when you
complete the perfect house,

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.230 align:middle line:84%
and God comes and
lives inside of you.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.420 align:middle line:90%
These are the seven stations.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So we can teach you how to walk
through these seven stations,

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and to, you know, reach into
these levels, depending on you.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Meaning your humbleness, your
humility, your sincerity.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:17.420 align:middle line:90%
The time you put into it.

00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You can learn these things.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:20.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.082 align:middle line:84%
I'll finish this, and then
I'll take your question, OK?

00:56:23.082 --> 00:56:25.730 align:middle line:10%
Then secondly,
we'll teach you how

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.960 align:middle line:10%
to receive the guidance
of God, and how

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:36.560 align:middle line:10%
to shine It on any part of
your life that isn't working.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And you'll learn how to walk
through that part of your life.

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.130 align:middle line:90%
We call these your trials.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:43.130 align:middle line:90%
These are your trials.

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll learn-- you
know, everybody gets trials,

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has
to go through them.

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And when you get through
them, you get the pot of gold.

00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:84%
The pot of gold is
learning the lesson

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:59.330 align:middle line:84%
of becoming the compassion,
or becoming the love,

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:02.960 align:middle line:84%
or becoming enlightened, or
becoming somebody who carries

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.160 align:middle line:90%
the truth inside of you.

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the pot of gold.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:06.620 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.140 align:middle line:84%
So we'll teach you
how to do that.

00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.280 align:middle line:84%
We'll help you to walk
through those seven stations,

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll help you to
learn the art of purification.

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Purification means
your ability to find

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:26.960 align:middle line:84%
these images, and these
patterns of light in the heart,

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:30.710 align:middle line:84%
in the soul, in the
secret, in the spirit,

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.920 align:middle line:84%
in the higher realities,
in the angelic world,

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and be able to wash
them out of your system.

00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we do deal
with the demonic.

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I
like to talk about.

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:43.830 align:middle line:90%
It does come up.

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:45.530 align:middle line:84%
It's coming up a lot right
now, as a matter of fact.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It's all over the place,
but we'll teach you

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.442 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with that.

00:57:49.442 --> 00:57:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Am I to understand that you
work with families, as well?

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:58.540 align:middle line:90%
Relationships, families.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, see, the beauty
is that with God's light--

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:05.760 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm not a
relationship therapist.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I haven't gone through years
of psychological studies.

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:16.250 align:middle line:84%
But with God's light shining the
light exactly on the problem--

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.890 align:middle line:84%
see, for example,
one woman-- she came,

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:19.740 align:middle line:90%
she wanted to leave her husband.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.610 align:middle line:90%
She had started to cheat on him.

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:25.070 align:middle line:90%
She was dating a cowboy.

00:58:25.070 --> 00:58:26.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.915 align:middle line:84%
I said to her, why are
you dating the cowboy?

00:58:27.915 --> 00:58:30.360 align:middle line:84%
She said, because
my husband's weak.

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.130 align:middle line:90%
I need strength.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Husband was it was a very
nice guy, and very soft.

00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:38.430 align:middle line:84%
But when we really asked God,
and we shined the light on it,

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.340 align:middle line:84%
what we really saw
inside was that she

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:46.320 align:middle line:84%
was frightened of his ability
to penetrate into her heart,

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:49.980 align:middle line:84%
and give her the love in a place
that she didn't want to go.

00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:53.250 align:middle line:84%
So what she was
needing was strength,

00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because she was afraid
of the husband's love,

00:58:56.310 --> 00:58:59.830 align:middle line:84%
and she found the cowboy
to teach her strength.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.390 align:middle line:90%
That make sense?

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.190 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I know, it sounds crazy,
but once she understood it,

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and she got hold of it,
she let go of the cowboy.

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:12.510 align:middle line:84%
The husband forgave her, they
moved back into a relationship,

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:16.495 align:middle line:84%
they fell back in love with each
other, they had another child.

00:59:16.495 --> 00:59:17.995 align:middle line:84%
And-- well, I don't
know about that,

00:59:17.995 --> 00:59:21.020 align:middle line:84%
but they're
definitely doing good.

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.000 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:22.800 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is-- if you want, we
have a foundations course.

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The foundations course
actually just began last week.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.310 align:middle line:84%
You can still come
into it, if you want.

00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:36.880 align:middle line:10%
If you call-- if you
call this number here,

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:40.060 align:middle line:10%
and you speak with
Carol, she can help you,

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.480 align:middle line:10%
to see if that course
is a fit for you.

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.660 align:middle line:84%
The foundation course
goes over six principles

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:90%
of learning how to do this.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.860 align:middle line:90%


00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It's online.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It's on the phone.

00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:54.960 align:middle line:84%
So you don't even
have to come see us.

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.760 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll come see you.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.760 align:middle line:90%
It's on [? Zoom. ?] OK?

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.700 align:middle line:84%
If you want to learn
it more deeply,

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.260 align:middle line:84%
we have, basically,
a two year program.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:06.500 align:middle line:84%
It goes through the
same six modules.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.210 align:middle line:90%
We take four months per module.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:14.420 align:middle line:84%
The first module, you'll
learn this connection to God.

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:15.890 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, you'll
spend the rest

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%
of your life working with it.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.640 align:middle line:90%
It never ends.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.220 align:middle line:90%
You know, it goes on.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.272 align:middle line:84%
You're never going
to stop that one.

01:00:22.272 --> 01:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
OK, the second module,
we're going to teach you

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
how to see these patterns.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The third module,
we teach you how

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to open the patterns
to see the images.

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.030 align:middle line:84%
The fourth one, we teach you
how to resolve these images,

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:40.480 align:middle line:84%
how to wash them away
using divine light.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:43.450 align:middle line:84%
The fifth one is we teach you
to understand the teachings

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that these have
come to teach you.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth one, that
we call beautification,

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.560 align:middle line:84%
you learn how to bring down from
the divine the teaching itself,

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.840 align:middle line:90%
so that you can embody it.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Those are the six modules.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Takes about four months
each to really get it, OK?

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And it has a-- you
meet for four days,

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and then you meet three times
a month for a couple hours,

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.610 align:middle line:90%
and then we teach it to you.

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:09.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.900 align:middle line:90%
So just so you know--

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if it makes
you any better,

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
my teacher was a man
named Muhammad Al-Jamal.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
He was head of the higher
Sufi council in Jerusalem,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.270 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:23.180 align:middle line:84%
He was considered to be one
of the preeminent Sufi masters

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
of our time, and he was
also a perfect master,

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:29.090 align:middle line:84%
who carried that seventh
station where God had come

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
and lived inside of him.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:34.850 align:middle line:84%
I spent 20 years at his side,
learning this healing from him.

01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:37.270 align:middle line:90%
That's where it comes from.

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned several
different tenets of religion,

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:48.408 align:middle line:84%
and your different
religious books.

01:01:48.408 --> 01:01:53.298 align:middle line:84%
So when you say God doesn't
matter what different religion

01:01:53.298 --> 01:01:55.510 align:middle line:90%
you are--

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:59.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, as long as your
religion is facing God.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Because some don't, or anything.

01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you're-- most of
the religions-- yeah,

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:05.700 align:middle line:90%
it's the same.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the religions are
all coming back to the one.

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:11.230 align:middle line:84%
They're all trying on
different levels, and--

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.030 align:middle line:90%
you know?

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And all have places
that are working,

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and all have places
that have gotten lost,

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:20.230 align:middle line:90%
and have to be worked on.

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:21.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes, sir?

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Two part question.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So first, educate us,
where did Sufism originate,

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:27.800 align:middle line:90%
and how did you--

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.120 align:middle line:90%
I guess you started out--

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew background.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.595 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you
migrate into Sufism?

01:02:36.595 --> 01:02:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that question,
how did you migrate?

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I like that word.

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I did.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:43.580 align:middle line:84%
I grew up Jewish,
although not very Jewish,

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to
become a rabbi, just

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:48.800 align:middle line:90%
because I liked the mystical.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.410 align:middle line:90%
My mother didn't like it.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Said no, so I did
not go that path.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
At that time, my brother
went out to India,

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.590 align:middle line:90%
became a [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:57.590 --> 01:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Became a Sannyasin,
and began studying

01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.480 align:middle line:90%
the Indian philosophies.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And when I got
out of college, he

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
invited me to come
over to India,

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
where I went into the
ashram and began meditating,

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and became sannyasin myself.

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, I did not
find the depth of things

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.870 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for there.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:21.080 align:middle line:84%
There were things that
weren't right for me.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.383 align:middle line:84%
It just had to do with
doing meditations,

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and it had to do it practices,
and things, you know?

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, just all
sorts of things like that.

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the deep way, there
was something missing.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Like, my heart
wasn't being filled.

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So I left that, and went
on my own for 10 years.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's when my
auric vision opened up,

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.242 align:middle line:84%
and I started seeing auras,
and all these things,

01:03:41.242 --> 01:03:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and started learning
the energetic stuff.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I got sick, and
I met the Sufi master.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And once I met him--

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.080 align:middle line:90%
he caught me the first moment.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I said to him, I really
want to get well,

01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:54.590 align:middle line:90%
and I want to be enlightened.

01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:56.145 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing at me.

01:03:56.145 --> 01:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why are
you laughing at me?

01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
He said, I can take
you far beyond anything

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
you think of as enlightenment.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
He had me in one minute.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:07.190 align:middle line:90%
I was in.

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So I said, OK, so
how do I do this?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And that became
20 years of study.

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:13.450 align:middle line:90%


01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:14.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you ever research in
terms of the doves and that

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:19.210 align:middle line:90%
process?

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:22.400 align:middle line:90%


01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it's funny it--

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.200 align:middle line:90%
no.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It never quite got back to
that, but that's something,

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
maybe, I will do.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.527 align:middle line:90%
That's a good point.

01:04:29.527 --> 01:04:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That would be interesting, yeah.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Full circle, eh?

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.820 align:middle line:90%
I might do that.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:37.684 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:04:37.684 --> 01:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
- Yeah, I'm gonna ask
you a difficult one here.

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Probably give you [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.680 align:middle line:84%
But you mentioned religions
a lot, you mentioned God.

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican pope,
which basically

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:51.465 align:middle line:84%
is the head of all Christianity
declared Lucifer as God,

01:04:51.465 --> 01:04:52.395 align:middle line:90%
publicly.

01:04:52.395 --> 01:04:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Lucifer.

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:54.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:54.935 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard that.

01:04:54.935 --> 01:04:57.445 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're saying that
we're supposed to contact him,

01:04:57.445 --> 01:04:58.320 align:middle line:90%
and bring his light--

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Lucifer means
bringer of the light.

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't mean love,
doesn't mean life.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
It just means light.

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:08.012 align:middle line:84%
You're saying we're supposed
to contact that God,

01:05:08.012 --> 01:05:09.630 align:middle line:90%
and bring his light in?

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm certainly not saying that.

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:13.545 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't heard that, but--

01:05:13.545 --> 01:05:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Google--

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe you.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I believe it.

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:21.676 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think people are
getting very confused today.

01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:23.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the word
God is confusing,

01:05:23.134 --> 01:05:24.843 align:middle line:84%
because God means
very different things.

01:05:24.843 --> 01:05:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah-- God, in my
understanding of God,

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:34.650 align:middle line:84%
is the source of all things
that manifest to us as light,

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
because that's how
we can find it.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Although it has a state beyond
light, which is un-manifest,

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and that that light
is the ultimate power,

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, in the sense
that it is ultimate good,

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and it is the ultimate creator,
and it has created all things,

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's set up this
whole thing of polarity,

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, and
everything we walk through,

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:58.980 align:middle line:90%
in order to return.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And what we're returning
to is that oneness.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.432 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, brilliant.

01:06:01.432 --> 01:06:02.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's your definition?

01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my definition.

01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:06.685 align:middle line:84%
>> My call is towards a
universal energy field.

01:06:06.685 --> 01:06:10.496 align:middle line:84%
But God, to most people,
means higher being.

01:06:10.496 --> 01:06:11.296 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:11.296 --> 01:06:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Which could mean-- just to
maintain higher vibration that

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
can come down, disappear,
and go do miracles.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's not--

01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:18.870 align:middle line:90%
that's not God.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And you know-- I mean,
some people think that.

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:21.670 align:middle line:90%
I know.

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but it's gotta
be think it, therefore--

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, you and I, and everybody
needs to break that stuff,

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.350 align:middle line:90%
because that's not right.

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.370 align:middle line:90%
You know, these are--

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:33.230 align:middle line:84%
even these smaller
things, and the--

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:35.000 align:middle line:90%
you know, what do you call it--

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the hopi kachinas, and even, you
know, things like Shiva, and--

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.840 align:middle line:90%
you know, these are attributes.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.840 align:middle line:84%
These are attributes
of divinity.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.860 align:middle line:90%
They're not the one.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Shiva is the giver of death.

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:49.220 align:middle line:90%
It's an attribute of divinity.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:51.900 align:middle line:90%
God brings death.

01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Or the-- OK, destroyer
of ignorance.

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, make that clear.

01:06:56.610 --> 01:06:57.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's a quality, right?

01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:00.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:02.750 align:middle line:90%
And that's a value.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- it's
an attribute of God.

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
These are all
attributes of divinity.

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
divinity is divinity,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and these attributes
that people worship

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:17.330 align:middle line:90%
are attributes of divinity.

01:07:17.330 --> 01:07:18.294 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

01:07:18.294 --> 01:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, more specific, with
Shiva, Zeus, they're ETs.

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
They came down, we
would call them now ETs.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
call them gods--

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:31.490 align:middle line:90%


01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:32.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:33.120 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
I have no problem with
that being a reality.

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I can certainly
see a culture that

01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.600 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't know a spaceship,
having a spaceship come down,

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.250 align:middle line:90%
and seeing it as a god.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, I could
certainly accept that.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
I could certainly see them
doing genetic manipulation,

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.010 align:middle line:90%
because they're doing it today.

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:50.350 align:middle line:90%
But that's still not God.

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe not in your religion.

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:52.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Not any god.

01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:56.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, to the people
here it's the god,

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
but in the nature of what
the divine presence is,

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.870 align:middle line:90%
it's something else.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And I apologize if I
maligned the Shiva.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Excuse me.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't meant that way.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not-- I haven't really
studied Hinduism in any depth,

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
so I just-- you know, when
people worship attributes,

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.109 align:middle line:84%
it's OK to look
at the attributes.

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:22.630 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to make
sure you put the one first.

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
The highest-- you have
to turn to the highest,

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.470 align:middle line:90%
because that's the ultimate.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.790 align:middle line:90%
So-- OK.

01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:31.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:36.270 align:middle line:90%


01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.389 align:middle line:90%
Kabbalah is very similar.

01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:38.189 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit
different, but there's

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:41.779 align:middle line:90%
a lot of similarities to it.

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.340 align:middle line:90%
It's Jewish mysticism, yes.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, kabbalah actually--
if you read it,

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.069 align:middle line:84%
it emanated from
the prophet Abraham,

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and it's kind of the
secret teachings of Abraham

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:56.945 align:middle line:84%
that got passed
through the ages.

01:08:56.945 --> 01:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I was studying [INAUDIBLE] I
had an out of body experience,

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:06.880 align:middle line:90%
and I got scared.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.385 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't have a teacher--

01:09:09.385 --> 01:09:11.427 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a teacher,
but nobody was around me

01:09:11.427 --> 01:09:12.828 align:middle line:90%
and I got scared.

01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:14.167 align:middle line:90%
So I stopped studying that.

01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
So because I didn't have--

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.146 align:middle line:84%
>> You didn't have a
teacher to help you?

01:09:17.146 --> 01:09:19.576 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, we had a teacher
in the Kabbalah Center.

01:09:19.576 --> 01:09:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But he cannot be with me
every time I want him.

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:24.574 align:middle line:90%
>> And he told me--

01:09:24.574 --> 01:09:26.446 align:middle line:84%
I called him, and I
said, I just got scared

01:09:26.446 --> 01:09:27.852 align:middle line:90%
because I saw my own body.

01:09:27.852 --> 01:09:28.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:28.652 --> 01:09:31.849 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have to really
study this, the teaching.

01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:32.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:34.899 align:middle line:84%
This is why you really--
you need a path,

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
you need a teacher.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know people think
you can do it yourself.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think in the west
we all want to do it ourselves,

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.883 align:middle line:84%
but I can tell you, in the
Sufi tradition, we know--

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's
been studies on this--

01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
there's only been one person in
the entire history of Sufism,

01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
which goes back 1,500
years, that reached

01:09:55.730 --> 01:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to this level of having
the house of God built

01:09:58.810 --> 01:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
in them completely, and
reaching the absolute level

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of perfection without a teacher.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
It was a woman, named Rabia.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
She was the only one that
did it without a teacher.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And every other one needed
the help of a teacher to walk.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that you put
your teacher in front of God.

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
And in Sufism, there's no guru.

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:22.880 align:middle line:90%
In Sufism, there's guides.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Guides help you to look
at what you're doing,

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
but the relationship
is between you and God,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.620 align:middle line:90%
and your heart and God.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the relationship.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.982 align:middle line:90%
In Sufism, there's no guru.

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
You don't worship them.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Stands in the way of God.

01:10:37.752 --> 01:10:40.030 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:43.360 align:middle line:84%
If that's the true guru,
then that's the right way.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.780 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if
everybody sees it that way.

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%
But that's true.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
So this is it.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
We're really here to help
you reach through your heart,

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.240 align:middle line:90%
through--

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.360 align:middle line:84%
the way we do it is
we take your heart,

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and we put you into
the presence of God,

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and we teach you to
establish this relationship

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
from your heart,
straight forward.

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that, it's
not from the third eye.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:11.640 align:middle line:90%
It's not the mind.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.737 align:middle line:84%
We're teaching you how
to find your heart,

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
and we're teaching you
how to put your heart

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:17.790 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of God.

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, you
are on the path of love,

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:23.490 align:middle line:84%
because your heart
is about love.

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And your heart will bring
you forward, face to face,

01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:32.525 align:middle line:84%
with divinity, and that
divinity will begin to walk you.

01:11:32.525 --> 01:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not me, it's not
Sufism, it's divine

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
walking you directly, because
of your relationship to the one.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And your job is
to learn to hear,

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to listen, to see, to know,
to distinguish, to discern,

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.070 align:middle line:84%
and to purify out
what's in yourself,

01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:56.778 align:middle line:90%
that might need to be changed.

01:11:56.778 --> 01:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:11:57.650 --> 01:11:59.817 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever found
anybody that went through all

01:11:59.817 --> 01:12:05.484 align:middle line:84%
the teachings, that
couldn't do everything?

01:12:05.484 --> 01:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to really put it,

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.520 align:middle line:84%
but someone that studied,
and did everything

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
they were supposed to
do, and then couldn't

01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:18.510 align:middle line:90%
get to enlightenment?

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- that's
a tough question.

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.870 align:middle line:90%
You know, I think--

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I've found people who have
studied the teachings,

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.430 align:middle line:90%
but didn't learn them.

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've found people
who didn't practice them.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.560 align:middle line:84%
I think I've seen
people walk the path,

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.880 align:middle line:90%
and not purify themselves.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, be in their mind, and
learn it from their mind.

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
But the people who have really,
sincerely bowed down to God--

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:44.372 align:middle line:84%
really been willing
to take the medicine

01:12:44.372 --> 01:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
when it's painful,
because sometimes it's

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.910 align:middle line:90%
not easy walking the path--

01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and had the courage to really
face what's inside of them--

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.490 align:middle line:90%
many of them ever reached.

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So you can reach, and you
know, it's not in my hands.

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't make that choice.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.188 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:12:59.188 --> 01:13:04.178 align:middle line:84%
>> This journey, I
know it's individual.

01:13:04.178 --> 01:13:08.669 align:middle line:84%
But in a general way, how long
does it take you to get to

01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> To learn this?

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, my feeling is
generally each station

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
takes one to two
years, as an average.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
You know?

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen people go--

01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:24.250 align:middle line:84%
I know one person who reached
the fourth station, which

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
is enlightenment,
but enlightenment

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.620 align:middle line:90%
through the heart.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It happens through the heart,
and not through the third eye,

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.060 align:middle line:90%
and they did it in nine months.

01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So I know one person who
took nine months to do it.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Most people take more
than that, and it

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.050 align:middle line:90%
has to do with sincerity.

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
You're busy working 8, 10 hours
a day, you're coming home,

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
you're tired, you're not
doing your practices,

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.110 align:middle line:90%
it's going to take longer.

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> How does that
person [INAUDIBLE]??

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:51.430 align:middle line:90%


01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:53.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know
you fell in love?

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's the same thing.

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.660 align:middle line:84%
When you reach it, there's
no question that you've--

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
one of my friends
is a physician.

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:04.410 align:middle line:84%
He's a zen Buddhist, and
he just went to his ashram,

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and he reached.

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:08.370 align:middle line:84%
He broke through in
his zen meditation.

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:10.290 align:middle line:90%
This was just a few months ago.

01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:11.340 align:middle line:90%
He came out of that--

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:14.653 align:middle line:90%


01:14:14.653 --> 01:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember what you call
the sittings that they do--

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, if you saw
him, his light was radiant.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And he was radiating
so much light.

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:25.320 align:middle line:90%
The joy in his heart was so--

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I looked at him, I
started laughing.

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And he laughed, and
he said, it happened.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.920 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it's like, the
most incredibly beautiful thing

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.073 align:middle line:90%
I've ever experienced.

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:39.240 align:middle line:84%
There's no question, when
you're there, you know it.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.820 align:middle line:90%


01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:46.598 align:middle line:90%


01:14:46.598 --> 01:14:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a very good question.

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.050 align:middle line:84%
That was actually,
when I meditated

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.270 align:middle line:84%
on this group, that was
the very question that I

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:53.320 align:middle line:90%
was asked to explain.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for making
sure I made the point clear.

01:14:56.650 --> 01:15:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Walking is the
ability of the heart.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
To walk through whatever
is blocking you from God.

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
have pain in your heart,

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.390 align:middle line:90%
you have to go through the pain.

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.790 align:middle line:84%
If you have rage,
anger, fear, hatred,

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to go
through the emotions.

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:21.190 align:middle line:10%
If you have
experiences that you've

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.710 align:middle line:10%
subjugated in your heart, like
where you broke your heart,

01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:25.377 align:middle line:10%
your father left,
your parents divorced,

01:15:25.377 --> 01:15:28.360 align:middle line:10%
something like that, that might
be causing problems inside

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.890 align:middle line:10%
of your heart.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
If you have misunderstood
the nature of reality,

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
so that your understanding
of reality is illusionary,

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
then you have illusions
inside of your heart.

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So you have to walk
through all those things

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
to get to the huck.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
The huck is truth.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:48.160 align:middle line:90%
God's truth.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:48.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.720 align:middle line:10%
And if you reach
that, then you have

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.760 align:middle line:10%
reached the fourth
station, and you've

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.560 align:middle line:10%
completed the first journey.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:57.170 align:middle line:90%
You can say you've graduated.

01:15:57.170 --> 01:15:59.070 align:middle line:90%
You've come home.

01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:15:59.870 --> 01:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%
You've claimed that mountain.

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
You've reached.

01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:03.772 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:16:03.772 --> 01:16:08.732 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] how chemotherapy
sometimes is not working

01:16:08.732 --> 01:16:12.452 align:middle line:84%
and doing this work-- that's
what medical spirits are

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:15.109 align:middle line:84%
hearing, because we bring
the medical together with

01:16:15.109 --> 01:16:16.380 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual.

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm-- yeah,
I'm a physician,

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:20.550 align:middle line:90%
and I believe in medicine.

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And I say that because I've
seen too many cases where people

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.570 align:middle line:10%
should have had medicine.

01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Like a guy that had
high blood pressure--

01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
220 over 180-- off of his drugs.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:37.260 align:middle line:84%
He was taking drugs, he
went to church in Sedona.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The church-- I used
to live in Sedona,

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:41.220 align:middle line:84%
so you get to hear a
lot of Sonoma stories--

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:44.220 align:middle line:84%
and the church told them
to go off his medicine.

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Cold turkey.

01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Which he did.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you can heal
this through your mind.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Off your drugs.

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Drop your drugs, and heal it.

01:16:52.290 --> 01:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:58.560 align:middle line:84%
He dropped the drugs, took a
long, hot hike in the desert,

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.050 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona, in the summer.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.360 align:middle line:90%
106 degrees, 110 degrees.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.570 align:middle line:90%
We found his body the next day.

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.370 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
He had a massive
stroke That's criminal.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I say
you have spiritual,

01:17:14.610 --> 01:17:16.670 align:middle line:90%
but you need medical.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:20.748 align:middle line:84%
So medical spiritual healing,
we monitor things like that.

01:17:20.748 --> 01:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
tell you to go off

01:17:22.290 --> 01:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
your drugs because you can
heal it through spirituality.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you can heal it through
spirituality, but until you do,

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.822 align:middle line:90%
don't go off your drug.

01:17:29.822 --> 01:17:31.405 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you
need them together.

01:17:31.405 --> 01:17:34.480 align:middle line:90%


01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And we do that with cancer,
and things like that.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Certainly you being an MD
gives you all the credibility--

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.720 align:middle line:84%
credentials for doing
the medical spiritual--

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:52.912 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's a lot
of medical medium--

01:17:52.912 --> 01:17:54.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you find that people
that don't have a doctor

01:17:59.465 --> 01:18:00.310 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:07.420 align:middle line:90%


01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have trained
thousands of people

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.502 align:middle line:84%
at this point, like
the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:12.502 --> 01:18:13.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the people
I've trained, she

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
works with cancer, and
all sorts of things,

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and had much success.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And she's not an MD, she's
a graphic designer, but--

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.670 align:middle line:84%
she graphically designs
their illnesses.

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
However, she does
very good with it.

01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And so yes, you can learn
it, and my passion--

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my desire is,
honestly, to bring

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.680 align:middle line:84%
large groups of people,
like yourselves,

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
to learn the system,
and to teach--

01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it
together with medicine.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.220 align:middle line:84%
So we can crack medicine open,
and it's not materialistic

01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:51.970 align:middle line:90%
only.

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:53.380 align:middle line:90%
That there's a spiritual side.

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I think if we do
that, we'll have

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.760 align:middle line:90%
left a good mark on this world.

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, my other
passion is helping people reach.

01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:01.130 align:middle line:90%
But those two things.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:03.190 align:middle line:84%
So yes, you can learn
this, and we have--

01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
like I said, we
have trained people.

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:07.930 align:middle line:10%
I've got people all
over the world now,

01:19:07.930 --> 01:19:10.540 align:middle line:10%
who are working in the ICU.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Working with people
with heart attacks,

01:19:13.150 --> 01:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
people with infectious diseases,
people who are dying of cancer,

01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:20.118 align:middle line:90%
and we are having success.

01:19:20.118 --> 01:19:21.160 align:middle line:90%
And you get certificates.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.202 align:middle line:90%
We have different levels.

01:19:22.202 --> 01:19:25.922 align:middle line:84%
Medical spiritual healer,
medical spiritual-- advanced

01:19:25.922 --> 01:19:27.880 align:middle line:84%
medical spiritual healer,
and things like that.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.560 align:middle line:84%
We have different
levels on that.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.204 align:middle line:84%
>> How does your cure--
medical community--

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:39.012 align:middle line:84%
because it's my impression the
medical community doesn't want

01:19:39.012 --> 01:19:41.096 align:middle line:84%
cures for cancer, at
least at the upper levels.

01:19:41.096 --> 01:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
The individual doctors, they
try and do what they can,

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.006 align:middle line:84%
but they're allowed to go
outside of their allowed

01:19:47.006 --> 01:19:47.838 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:47.838 --> 01:19:50.812 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, they get [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:50.812 --> 01:19:54.201 align:middle line:84%
And it's been
obvious that doctors

01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:56.483 align:middle line:84%
who have come to those
conclusions in cancer,

01:19:56.483 --> 01:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
have come up with cures, have
been both ridiculed and taken

01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
down, followed the--

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:03.455 align:middle line:90%
found floating in rivers.

01:20:03.455 --> 01:20:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Lots of these things, especially
in the last few years.

01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.075 align:middle line:84%
>> What kind of interactions
have you had with the pure

01:20:10.075 --> 01:20:11.895 align:middle line:84%
medical community,
in which you--

01:20:11.895 --> 01:20:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you see, I'm not
against the medical community,

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:16.960 align:middle line:90%
so I'm kind of a maverick.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I have a foot in both worlds.

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So my being, because I
accept it and appreciate it,

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'll use chemo and
radiation when needed,

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.815 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a target, in that sense.

01:20:27.815 --> 01:20:28.690 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not trying to get
people to turn away from it.

01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to say make
the best decision,

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:37.900 align:middle line:84%
and if chemo and radiation is
your best decision, make it.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.200 align:middle line:84%
And do the spiritual healing,
so that once you're healed,

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't come
back in three years.

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:44.170 align:middle line:90%
If possible.

01:20:44.170 --> 01:20:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Work with the deep causes of it
while you're getting your chemo

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.100 align:middle line:90%
and radiation.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.106 align:middle line:90%
And that works well.

01:20:50.106 --> 01:20:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> A similar question regarding
spirituality, and [INAUDIBLE]??

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%


01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>> People can learn.

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.175 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can learn.

01:21:00.175 --> 01:21:01.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just a muscle.

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
There are muscles
you need to learn.

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:03.720 align:middle line:90%
You can open those muscles.

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
When you open
them, you'll learn.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen anybody
blind, spiritually.

01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Except one group called Third
Eye Blind, but that was it.

01:21:13.130 --> 01:21:15.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.770 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:26.090 align:middle line:90%


01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry, say it again?

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> With disease--

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:35.670 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
If you really look at most
diseases, it's lack of peace.

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And lack of peace because
they don't have compassion.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Lack of peace because
they don't have mercy.

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Lack of peace because they
don't have inner strength.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Lack of peace because
they don't have wisdom.

01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
it's disease is lack of peace.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.716 align:middle line:84%
It's disharmony based
on the 99 names.

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:05.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that talked
about in Sufism?

01:22:05.415 --> 01:22:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry, say it again?

01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.860 align:middle line:90%


01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, you can Google it.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It's on-- just 99 names
of God, they'll come up.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:21.390 align:middle line:90%
In Sufism.

01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:22.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.140 align:middle line:90%
Starts with the compassionate.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't start
with the compassionate,

01:22:25.150 --> 01:22:26.080 align:middle line:90%
it's a different list.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.970 align:middle line:90%


01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:22:29.770 --> 01:22:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Every religion
has names for God.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a million names
for God, you know?

01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:39.453 align:middle line:90%
But there are essential, key--

01:22:39.453 --> 01:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
like, what do you
want to call it?

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Attributes.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.810 align:middle line:84%
There are probably thousands,
and hundreds of thousands

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:45.610 align:middle line:90%
of names.

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:46.900 align:middle line:90%
But there are central--

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.970 align:middle line:84%
like the rainbow,
when it diffuses,

01:22:48.970 --> 01:22:52.270 align:middle line:84%
it breaks into those
seven different layers.

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
The same way with God,
when you diffuse God,

01:22:54.370 --> 01:22:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and it breaks into
what it breaks into.

01:22:57.220 --> 01:22:58.065 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:22:58.065 --> 01:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
All right, I think
we're at time.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
They're asking me to stop, so
we'll honor their time frames.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.522 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:06.522 --> 01:23:07.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.480 align:middle line:90%


01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.230 align:middle line:90%
