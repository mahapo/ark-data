00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a very
special weekend.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Please, give it up for
Mr. Erich Von Daniken.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.130 align:middle line:90%
Erich.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.380 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.055 align:middle line:90%
You are the greatest.

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the introduction.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.700 align:middle line:90%
I am from Switzerland.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:90%
My English is not the best.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
I still have a
heavy German accent,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
but I hope you
will understand me.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a long, long time ago.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
No one knows how long,
but at least 6,000 years.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And then a gigantic spaceship
surrounded our planet.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.920 align:middle line:90%
How do we know this?

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We know it first,
from old Indian texts.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
old Indian texts

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
which are at least 6,000
years old, and there,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth book
of the Mahabharata,

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:90%
with the name Mausala Parva.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:84%
There, you can read that all
of a sudden, three cities--

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.030 align:middle line:84%
they call it cities,
not spaceships

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.420 align:middle line:84%
because they had no word for
spaceships-- three cities

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:90%
surrounded our planet Earth.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
The people, while watching
these cities in the firmament,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.400 align:middle line:90%
they were talking about them.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
from these three cities,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
smaller vehicles
descended to our planet.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
The old Indians called these
smaller vehicles vimanas.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.560 align:middle line:84%
There were different types of
vimanas, not only one shape.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like today, we have
different types of aircrafts.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
A helicopter doesn't look the
same thing like as a jumbo jet,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
or a propellant aircraft
is not the same thing

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
as a jet airliner.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So there were different
types of vimanas.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And out of these
smaller vehicles,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we would call them
today space shuttles.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
so-called gods came out--

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:90%
so-called gods.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
We all know that there are no
gods, there is only one god.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But our ancestor and
Stone Age people, they

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
could not understand
what was going on.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So they believed that these
visitors are some gods.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:84%
The word gods is a
misunderstanding.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:90%
There were never gods.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
They simply called the
extraterrestrials gods.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So these so-called
gods came out,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:84%
they looked around the
planet, and they chose a few

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:90%
of the young men to teach them.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
One of the young men,
his name was Arjuna,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and Arjuna was
brought up to the sky.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle line:84%
He learned the language
of the extraterrestrials.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
They teach him in writing.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And later, they brought him
back to the planet Earth.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:84%
And here, of course,
the people ask him,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Arjuna, where have you been?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.610 align:middle line:90%
What have you seen?

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And Ajrjuna was writing
down his experiences

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:90%
with the so-called gods.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.180 align:middle line:84%
He said he was up there in
this city over the planet,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and as high as he came, he saw a
lot of smaller cities up there.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
composited-- they

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
looked like different balls,
one ball next to the other ball.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what the eyewitness
Arjuna said 6,000 years ago.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:10%
He himself was brought up
with an object called vimana.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:10%
As I said before, the vimanas
were a smaller object.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Arjuna even knows
the name of his pilot

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
who brought him out there.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.970 align:middle line:90%
His pilot's name was Matalib.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They brought him up there,
he saw gigantic cities.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
He called them cities
because in his time

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
he had no word for spaceship,
neither for mother spaceship.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
He was taught up there,
he learned the language

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
of these extraterrestrials.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized that
these extraterrestrials,

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
they had fights, discrepancies
among them each other.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Some of these extraterrestrials,
they wanted to have sex with

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
humans on the planet, others
said, no, that's forbidden,

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:90%
we cannot do this.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of them want to
steal our raw material,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
others say, no, we are
not allowed to do this.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So there was a fight in heaven,
a war in heaven described

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
by Arjuna in the fifth
book of the Mahabharata,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:90%
in the Mausala Parva.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Two of these cities
were destroyed.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And from the
earthlings, it looks

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.530 align:middle line:84%
as if 10,000 of little stones
are falling down from the sky.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we hear such
a story 6,000 years old,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.600 align:middle line:84%
our first reaction is, this is
all fantasy, that's all dreams.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:90%
A war in the sky?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.220 align:middle line:90%
A war in heaven?

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.260 align:middle line:90%
That's rubbish.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.270 align:middle line:90%
They simply had dreams.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the dream.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is, every
great mythology, start

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
with Greek mythology,
it doesn't matter what,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:90%
starts with the war in heaven.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
In Greece, for example,
the god Zeus first

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.550 align:middle line:90%
has to fight against Cronus.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Take our own religion, be
it Jewish or Christian.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:84%
When I was a boy,
they teach me, Erich,

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.520 align:middle line:84%
when you finally die
and you are a brave man,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:90%
you will go to heaven.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Heaven is the
place of happiness.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:84%
In heaven, you are assembled
with god and the angels.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And later I learned
as an adult, there

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
was a fight, a war in heaven.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:90%
Don't you remember?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, an archangel
with the name of Lucifer

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
comes through the throne of
the almighty god and said,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:90%
we don't serve you anymore.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the
archangel Michael came

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
to destroy Lucifer
and his disciples.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
If heaven would have been the
place of absolute happiness,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
then a war in heaven
is impossible.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Then you are happy, then you
have no opposition, nothing.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
So we should try
to change the world

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:84%
heaven into sky or into
space, then it makes sense.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:84%
The same situation we have
with the word like angels.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We are taught that
angels are the good ones.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
Angels, they are represented
in Stone Age cave paintings

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
with helmets, halos, we make
designs, they have wings.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
They were the nice
guys, the angels.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, some of these
angels were a catastrophe.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
They killed and destroyed
thousands and thousands

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
of people directly from the air.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Here, for example,
this is in Egypt.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.650 align:middle line:90%
This is the temple called Edfu.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And on this wall of
the Edfu temple--

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.900 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
On this wall of the
Edfu temple, it's

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
described how a god,
his name was Horus,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
came down and
helped the pharaoh.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
The pharaoh said,
please, I need your help

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
because I'm
surrounded by enemies.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, this god with
the name of Horus

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
destroyed all the enemies
of the pharaoh from the air.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is in Egypt.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But the same story
we read in the Bible.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:84%
Just take the second book
of the Kings, for example.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the warrior
they called the god [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:90%
from Persia.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.725 align:middle line:84%
The same story we
have in the Bible.

00:07:24.725 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Just read, for example,
the second book

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Kings,
Chapter 19, Verse 35.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:90%
And there it says--

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.946 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:07:31.946 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And the angel came
down from heaven

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
and killed 185,000 Assyrians.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
On the next morning, there were
only dead bodies on the ground.

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:52.480 align:middle line:84%
An angel from heaven
killed 185,000 Assyrians.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to change the word angel
into the word extraterrestrial.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Now I've changed two words.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I changed heaven into space.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I changed angels into
extraterrestrials.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Now we just have to change 10
key words in the ancient texts,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
and I changed the whole
contexts of the old texts.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's time we do this.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.910 align:middle line:90%
We really have to do this.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So we have these inscriptions
of the so-called angels,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.260 align:middle line:84%
but the angels were
extraterrestrials.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of the very
clear description,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.579 align:middle line:84%
which you easily can
control and which

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:84%
was part of "Chariots
of the Gods,"

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
which I was more than 50 years
ago, comes from the Bible.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Remember the story in the Bible
concerning the prophet Ezekiel?

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, we find him at
the end of the Bible,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.472 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the Old Testament.

00:08:48.472 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I first now show you
five pictures coming out

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of old Bible, I mean,
old Bible, 200 years old,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.960 align:middle line:84%
simply to give an
impression what

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.130 align:middle line:84%
our forefathers had in mind when
they read the text of Ezekiel.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Later, I'll explain
to you how we

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.110 align:middle line:84%
came to make a
modern explanation

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.040 align:middle line:90%
of the whole Ezekiel story.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I will show
you a computer animation

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:84%
concerning Ezekiel, which is one
of the best you can ever see.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, by the way, you
have to know, by profession,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
he was high priest at
the temple of Jerusalem.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
In his time, roughly 600
BC, the Jewish community,

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem was captured
by the Babylonians.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And all the high society
of the Jewish community

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
went as slaves to Babylonia,
including Ezekiel.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:84%
As a high priest, he
belonged to the high society.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.940 align:middle line:90%
So he was a slave in Babylonia.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And he writes, they were working
there for the Babylonians.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
the firmament opened.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.410 align:middle line:84%
These people, the slaves hear
the noise in the firmament.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
They saw a light and
something was coming down.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.490 align:middle line:90%
They all were afraid.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they believed
God is visiting us.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:10%
Ezekiel is a high priest.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:10%
He's the first one
who thinks, I have

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.130 align:middle line:10%
to give all honor to the gods.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:10%
So he has to first,
when he stands up,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:10%
and then he realizes
this is not God,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:10%
and he describes what happened.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:10%
So this is Ezekiel
out of an old Bible.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:10%
And just before him, he
sees a gigantic thing.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:10%
He calls this gigantic
object, the whole thing he

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
calls the splendorness of God.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing is the
splendorness of God

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
or the splendorness
of the highest.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:90%
I must make a personal remark.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I was educated in a Catholic
boarding school led by Jesuits.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
We had to translate part of
the Bible, including Ezekiel,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
from Greek to Latin and
from Latin to German.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the original Ezekiel,
the word God never appears.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
In our translations,
be it the German

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
or the English translation, we
read the splendorness of God.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:84%
In the original, it
says, the splendorness

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
of the highest, which
is quite a difference.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So all this together, he
calls it the splendorness

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:90%
of the highest.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.150 align:middle line:84%
He says, up there, I saw
something like glittering rays.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:90%
There was a drone inside.

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And on this drone, the
highest was sitting.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
In your Bible translation,
it says, on a drone,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:90%
God was sitting.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Not in the edition
of the Ezekiel.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Then he saw four
living creatures,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and he says these four
living creatures had wings,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:90%
each one had four wings.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And when the wings moved,
a terrible noise appeared.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes the noise
and compares the noise

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
with the thundering
of a waterfall.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So these wings must have
made a terrible noise.

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:90%
Then he describes the legs.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.190 align:middle line:84%
The legs were out of metal,
definitely [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:10%
the metal.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:10%
And then he comes and
describes the wheel.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.240 align:middle line:10%
He sees four wheels,
and now he does not

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.370 align:middle line:10%
understand anything anymore.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:10%
Wheels in Ezekiel's
time, they can go forward

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:10%
and backward, a normal wheel.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But the wheels he see
here on the splendorness

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
of the highest, they can
go forward, backward, right

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and left at the same time
without making a steering

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:90%
movement.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine you are
sitting in your car.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Now you have your
steering wheel.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Now you turn because you
want to go to the curb.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
The front wheels turn because
you're going to the curb.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes a wheel which
goes forward, backward, right,

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and left without ever
make a turning movement.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what confuses
him completely.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
He describes this
wheel four times.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And then finally, directs
the body and all the details.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
So this, you all can read in the
Bible in the book of Ezekiel.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I just have assumed
a few keywords.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Roughly 35 years ago,
I had a secret speech

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
here in the United
States in Huntsville

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
at NASA, the Space
Administration.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Secret because both
parties, NASA and I,

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.472 align:middle line:90%
we agreed not to go to public.

00:13:22.472 --> 00:13:24.680 align:middle line:84%
NASA did not publish that
Erich Von Daniken was there

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and I did not publish
that I was at NASA.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
All the main rockets people,
professors, engineers

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
were there, including
Wernher von Braun, et cetera.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.090 align:middle line:84%
After my speech at
NASA, we had dinner,

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
and then Mr. Joe
Blumrich came to me.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Blumrich was, at that time, the
head of construction department

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.970 align:middle line:90%
at NASA.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.310 align:middle line:84%
He was coming
originally from Austria.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So he speaks German
and English fluently.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And while we had dinner,
he came to me and said,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Erich, that was
quite fascinating,

00:13:56.510 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:84%
but you spoke about the prophet
called Ezekiel in the Bible.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But in the Bible,
you will definitely

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.520 align:middle line:90%
never find any technology.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
The Bible-- these are
visions, these are dreams.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:84%
They saw God and these
drone driving around.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.450 align:middle line:84%
But this is not reality,
it's just imagination.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
You will never find any
technology in the Bible.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Anyhow, he means very friendly.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I am the first one who
pointed him to Ezekiel.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
He never heard something about
Ezekiel in his life before.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.523 align:middle line:84%
And he told me, now I
want to read the Bible.

00:14:28.523 --> 00:14:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Soon, in the next two
weeks, when I have time,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I want to read this
Ezekiel personally.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And he did.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
He started to read
Ezekiel word by word.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And he got very
confused because Ezekiel

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:84%
makes very, very clear
statements, statements

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.750 align:middle line:84%
how big the wheel was,
how big he was, et cetera.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:90%
So you could draw conclusions.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Then two other NASA engineers
came to Blumrich's office

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and asked him, Josef, what
are you doing with the Bible

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:90%
on your desk?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
We are engineers, we
are rocket constructors.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.492 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you remember this
Von Daniken here talking to us

00:15:04.492 --> 00:15:05.780 align:middle line:90%
about the Bible and Ezekiel?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:90%
This is fascinating.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.070 align:middle line:90%
I just read this Ezekiel story.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:84%
We really are able
to reconstruct

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:90%
what Ezekiel was describing.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:84%
You remember, Ezekiel
described the whole object

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
as the splendorness
of the highest.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, NASA analyzed phrase
by phrase of Ezekiel,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
they start to make
designs, and they

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.150 align:middle line:90%
start to make calculations.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And finally, they
had the object--

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.940 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And this was what
it looked like.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:84%
This is what Ezekiel called the
splendorness of the highest.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So the whole thing,
the totality,

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.310 align:middle line:84%
is the splendorness
of the highest.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.740 align:middle line:84%
On the top, he saw
something glittering,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and inside there was
a chair, a drone.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And on this drone, the
highest were sitting.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The drone was nothing else
than the chair of the commander

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:90%
of the spaceship.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.640 align:middle line:90%
And he has his spacesuit on.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.605 align:middle line:90%
That's why he was glittering.

00:16:06.605 --> 00:16:09.220 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he describes the wings,
which make a terrible noise,

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and he describes the
detail, including the wheel.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And now it becomes complicated.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Wheels, I told you, at Ezekiel's
time, they can go forward

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.540 align:middle line:90%
and backward.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
But Ezekiel describes a
wheel which goes forward

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and backward and right and
left at the same time, which

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
confuses him completely.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, NASA started to
reconstruct a new wheel.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:84%
This new wheel is separated
in different sections.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Every section has its own
wheel which you can turn

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:90%
on one side or the other side.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with that wheel,
you can go forward or backward.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
If this wheel should
move towards you,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:84%
only the lower section would
move towards you or back.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And with this wheel, you
can go in any direction

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
without making a movement.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
The wheel never turns
as our wheel of the car.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
In every direction, right on the
[INAUDIBLE] you can move this.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.470 align:middle line:84%
By the way, NASA received
an international patent

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:90%
for that wheel.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I think that's very funny.

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:90%
We have a patent on the wheel.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, they use it
on Mars on the Mars robot.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
But the original idea
comes from Ezekiel.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you read
Ezekiel, you will

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
realize that Ezekiel
describes the splendorness

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:84%
of the highest, this object,
from Chapter 1 to 40.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And then Chapter 41,
something different happened.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:84%
He says, the splendorness of
the highest arrived again.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:90%
That means a second time.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:84%
This space shuttle was
descending a second time

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
to Ezekiel.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And this time, Ezekiel writes,
the hand of the highest

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
took me on my chest and
put me on the chair.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
In my modern
interpretation, simply he

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
was taken up to the
co-pilot's seat.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Then the splendorness
of the highest goes up.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel feels the
gravity on his chest.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:84%
He said, and the hand of the
highest pressed upon my chest.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But he has no idea
where they go.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So he writes in the
Bible, they brought me

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
to a very, very high mountain.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
He states clearly, not a high
mountain, a very, very high

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:90%
mountain.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:84%
They were flying
over the mountain

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
under him, something

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
like a big village
or a little city

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:90%
appears with different houses.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the center of this city
is something like a temple.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel in his books does
not say in the original

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:90%
it was a temple.

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
He says, it looked
like a temple.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Because he doesn't
know what it is.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have to ask yourself
the question, what is a temple?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
What was a temple
5,000 years ago?

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.050 align:middle line:84%
A temple was a building
for the gods, nothing else.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Later, we made out temple
spiritually for the gods.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.400 align:middle line:84%
In antiquity, it
was simply a house

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
for the gods, the
so-called gods,

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.820 align:middle line:84%
the extraterrestrials
were living.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So they are flying
over this little city,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and beneath them is
something like a temple.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And the splendorness
of the highest,

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and Ezekiel is sitting in there,
slowly goes into the building.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And he hears the
noise of the wheels

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:90%
at that time in every detail.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they came
to a standstill.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, one of
these glittering beings, a man,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
a human-like being, glittering
clothes comes to Ezekiel.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning, he
says, he looks at Ezekiel, oh,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.290 align:middle line:90%
humans.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You humans, you have eyes
to see, but you see nothing.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:middle line:84%
You have ears to hear,
but you hear nothing.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the stranger
all of a sudden

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.770 align:middle line:84%
has a measuring
device in his hands,

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and he orders Ezekiel,
now you measure

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%
this building, every detail.

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, in the meantime,
knows clearly this is not God.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:90%
He's not afraid again.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
He asks back, why should
I measure this building?

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And the other one says, that's
the reason why we brought you

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:90%
And he starts to measure--

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.990 align:middle line:84%
length, large, every step,
every stone, every detail.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Read it in Ezekiel starting
at Chapter 41, pages

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:90%
of measurement.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.050 align:middle line:84%
These measurements--
a German engineer,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.730 align:middle line:84%
his name was Hans
Herbert Beier--

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.860 align:middle line:90%
he studied these measurements.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And he asked himself,
is this a real building

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:84%
or is this just
biblical imagination?

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And like Blumrich
did, the NASA people

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.570 align:middle line:84%
only reconstructed
the splendorness

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.600 align:middle line:90%
the highest, the whole body.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And now this German
engineer group

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:84%
only reconstructs the
so-called temple, the building.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:84%
One day, I received a
large letter at my desk

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
at home, yellow envelope
with 30 pages in there.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And there, I saw fantastical
technical designs

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and the letter of
a German engineer.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know him personally
at that time, Mr. Hans Herbert

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:90%
Beier.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Dear
Mr. Von Daniken,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:84%
we reconstructed the
building according

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.410 align:middle line:90%
to Ezekiel's measurement.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.200 align:middle line:84%
We did not add one
centimeter, one inch.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:90%
We nothing take off.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
We exactly took the dates which
Ezekiel gave us in the Bible.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And this was the reconstruction.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:51.730 align:middle line:84%
That's how this
building looked like.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
I was very confused
and very happy.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
I visited this engineer, Hans
Herbert Beier, and I asked him,

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.730 align:middle line:84%
do you have an idea
what NASA made?

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You remember, NASA
only reconstructed

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
the flying machine, the
splendorness of the highest.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
The German engineers
only reconstructed

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:90%
the house, the building.

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:84%
The German, of
course, knew nothing

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.050 align:middle line:90%
about the American scientists.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I brought the two groups
together and both fit perfectly

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.690 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The so-called temple was simply
the earthly space station,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
but a space shuttle.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Had nothing to do
with the holy thing.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, once you have
made these analogies,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
you should tell something
about the Bible.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.330 align:middle line:84%
I told you I had in young
years translated the Ezekiel

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and I know what's
the story in there.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.490 align:middle line:84%
In theology-- and these are
honest and wonderful people.

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not the question
of conspiracy.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.490 align:middle line:84%
In theology, they believed
that Ezekiel has a vision.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
He sees the Almighty
God sitting on a chair

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:90%
on his drone flying around.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, I personally--

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.420 align:middle line:90%
I am a deep believer in God.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Still today, I am one of
these few persons who pray.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
But my God does
not need a vehicle

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
in which to move
around from point A

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:90%
to point B. My god is all over.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And the vehicle of
God does not make

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
noise and trembling and loud
noise and sand blowing up

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.550 align:middle line:90%
and heat, et cetera.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So I don't believe
in the vision.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, no, this was not the
vision that was a reality.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, theologians believe
that Ezekiel has the visions,

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.470 align:middle line:84%
he sees the Almighty God on
his flying chariot, chariot

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:90%
of the gods flying around.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in the second
part of the Bible,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.300 align:middle line:84%
where Ezekiel gives all these
measurement of this building,

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the theologians
believe now he has

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
a vision of a future temple
in the future Jerusalem, which

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:90%
is completely rubbish again.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
If you know the Hebrew
language, the original written

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
form in which
Ezekiel was written,

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.930 align:middle line:84%
it's written in a
Semitic language.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:84%
In a Semitic language, you
have only a consonants--

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:90%
R, N, Y, et cetera.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:90%
But no A, E, O, et cetera.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And from the grammatic,
there is no future.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It all is written
in the present.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So there was a temple, I saw
the temple, I measured it.

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now theologians, they believe
he has a vision of the future.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So when you read Ezekiel,
you will read there

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and there will be
a temple, which

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.930 align:middle line:84%
will be so long and so large,
et cetera, which is not correct.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:53.640 align:middle line:84%
The correct translation is not,
there will be in the future.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The correct translation
is, there was a building

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:90%
so long, so large, et cetera.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:84%
By the way, theological version
does not function anyhow not.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes,
and they brought me

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.260 align:middle line:90%
on a very, very high mountain.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Where in Jerusalem
or near Jerusalem

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.550 align:middle line:90%
is a very, very high mountain?

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:15.450 align:middle line:90%
I know the region.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.622 align:middle line:84%
A few hills, that's
all that's there.

00:25:17.622 --> 00:25:19.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing of a high mountain.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
They brought him on a
very, very high mountain.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit to Jerusalem.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't fit the
future of Jerusalem.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He was on a complete
different place.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we made a
computer animation

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
to explain to you what
Ezekiel really saw.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.450 align:middle line:84%
They were slaves that were
captured by the Babylonians

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:84%
on the river by
the name of Chebar.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:84%
And then they hear
a noise in the sky.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:51.190 align:middle line:90%
In orbit is a mother spaceship.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:84%
From this mother spaceship,
a smaller vehicle is let out.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Only when the smaller vehicle
reached the atmosphere,

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:90%
the noise began.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Outside, where there is
no air, you hear no noise.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Only now.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So they hear a noise, they
see a vehicle coming down.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.420 align:middle line:90%
They are all afraid.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel as a high
priest is afraid,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
but his colleagues, the slaves,
the workers are all afraid.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.050 align:middle line:90%
They all fell on the ground.

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:21.650 align:middle line:84%
They all believed, now we
see the real Almighty God.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel as a high
priest is the first--

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
he stands up because he wants
to give reverence and honor

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to the Almighty God.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And then Ezekiel
realizes this is not God.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And then he starts
to write, to describe

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.480 align:middle line:84%
what he sees-- the wings, the
wheels, the noise, the detail,

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.580 align:middle line:84%
He describes what he
sees and the splendorness

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:90%
of the highest.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:84%
He gives the detail
of the wheels.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.550 align:middle line:84%
He realized that the wheels
can go in all four directions

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.880 align:middle line:84%
without making a steering
movement, which confuses him

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.200 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:90%
He writes it down four times.

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Then he was taken himself up.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They put him on the chair of
the co-pilot, and they fly away.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel feels when
they start the pressure--

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.740 align:middle line:84%
he says, and the hand of the
highest pressed upon my chest.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.720 align:middle line:90%
He doesn't know where they go.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.580 align:middle line:84%
That's why he writes,
they brought me

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.910 align:middle line:90%
on a very, very high mountain.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.740 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know the
name of the mountain,

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:84%
but definitely was not
Jerusalem, neither Jerusalem

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.410 align:middle line:90%
of his time, nor in the future.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Up there, he sees something
like a small city,

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and in the center of it,
something like a temple,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:90%
a building of the gods.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.950 align:middle line:84%
He is sitting in
the splendorness

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:43.380 align:middle line:90%
of the highest himself.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I assume his co-pilot
would have calmed him down

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
and said, don't be afraid,
human, don't be afraid.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Just remark-- write everything
down what you realize here.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Because you have
to write it down

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.710 align:middle line:10%
for your future generations.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.240 align:middle line:90%
So Ezekiel writes what he sees.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The splendorness of the
highest came to a standstill

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.840 align:middle line:84%
over this building,
the so-called temple.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.520 align:middle line:10%
Slowly, slowly, they
sunk into the building.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.220 align:middle line:10%
At that occasion,
Ezekiel writes,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.610 align:middle line:10%
and the noise of the
wheels were at that time

00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:10%
double as loud as
before in the desert.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Because now he hears
the echo, the echo

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.020 align:middle line:90%
comes back from the walls.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.030 align:middle line:90%
The noise is double as loud.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the splendorness of the
highest came to a standstill.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.640 align:middle line:90%
Ezekiel can stand out.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And then some of
these extraterrestrial

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.540 align:middle line:84%
arrives in these
glittering clothes.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
When he sees Ezekiel, he
simply says, oh, come on.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Humans-- you humans have eyes
to see, but you see nothing.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.660 align:middle line:84%
You have ears to hear,
but you hear nothing.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
he has a measuring device,

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and he orders Ezekiel to
measure the whole temple.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel does
measure the temple.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel has the courage
to ask back, why?

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Why should I
measure this temple?

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And the other says, that's the
reason why we brought you here.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Then the Ezekiel book stops--

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.470 align:middle line:84%
the Ezekiel book in the
Bible stops abruptly.

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It has no final.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:13.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the
whole Ezekiel text.

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So why should the group
of extraterrestrials

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
take from a group of
humans, the group of slaves,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.360 align:middle line:90%
the leader, Ezekiel?

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Why should they bring him
to their space station

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.680 align:middle line:90%
on a high mountain?

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Why should they ask him
to make measurements?

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of all this?

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.430 align:middle line:84%
At Ezekiel's time,
they all believed

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:44.580 align:middle line:84%
this is the real God,
the God of the universe.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel himself
is a high priest.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:84%
They capture his high priest,
they brought him away.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe for a few hours,
maybe for a day.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.190 align:middle line:90%
What do we know?

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And then they brought
him back to his people.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, his people, his
friends, his colleagues

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
are asking, Ezekiel,
you are back here.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.365 align:middle line:90%
Are you in good health?

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Have you been hungry?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:90%
Thirsty?

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Have you had pain, something?

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:90%
But Ezekiel is very happy.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.830 align:middle line:84%
He says, no, no, I was on
a very, very high mountain.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I was flying there.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.050 align:middle line:90%
There was a temple.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:90%
I had to measure the temple.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Here are the measurement dates.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Because his society
believes that all this has

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to do with the real
God, the omnipotent God.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel himself
is a high priest.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.810 align:middle line:84%
His measurement
dates and his report

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.960 align:middle line:90%
is not thrown away to ashes.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:84%
They keep it into
the holy books.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.710 align:middle line:84%
They believe it has to do
with God, the real God.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The extraterrestrials knew
exactly this primitive society

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.180 align:middle line:84%
will grow up with a lot of
technological evolution.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:84%
3,000 or 4,000 years later,
the holy texts are still here.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Normal texts, they disappear,
but not the holy books.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:84%
The holy books are translated
into many languages,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.610 align:middle line:84%
as we have with the
Bible and Ezekiel.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:84%
So the future society, maybe
3,000, 4,000 years later, they

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.960 align:middle line:90%
will read this text of Ezekiel.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The future society are still
strong believers in God,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:19.640 align:middle line:84%
but not believers in little
gods who do not exist.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
They will realize, this is a
technological description--

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
wheels which can go in
every direction, lakes

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.420 align:middle line:84%
out of metal, that
the splendorness--

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.890 align:middle line:90%
that the wings make noise.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
They will realize
this is technology

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
which somebody described
thousands of years in the past.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And now the humans will
start to ask questions.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.060 align:middle line:90%
They will ask questions.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, did we have a
higher society before?

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.590 align:middle line:84%
A higher technological
advanced society?

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Or was this a wizard
from outer space?

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a wizard
from outer space,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:56.800 align:middle line:90%
where is the proof?

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Have these
extraterrestrials just

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.540 align:middle line:84%
disappeared without
leaving something?

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.790 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what they
wanted because of Ezekiel.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:90%
And not only of Ezekiel.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.160 align:middle line:84%
In old Indian, we have Arjuna,
the one who was taken away,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:12.970 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.710 align:middle line:90%
And in other texts.

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They want that the
future societies

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:90%
stumble on these texts.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:90%
They have to read these texts--

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
hey, come on, something
is wrong with our past.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we have today.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Because of Ezekiel,
because of these old texts,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.040 align:middle line:84%
we have this new question
with question marks.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.600 align:middle line:90%
That's what they wanted.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to bring us to the
question, where is the proof?

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Where is the time capsule?

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:46.550 align:middle line:84%
What is the something these
so-called gods left behind?

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Another story, which I've just
come very short with is Enoch.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.510 align:middle line:84%
Enoch in the Bible in
the Old Testament--

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
you just read two
phrases about him.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Oh, but you read Enoch
was the seventh patriarch

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.820 align:middle line:90%
before the Great Flood.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
The seventh patriarch
at first was Adam,

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.930 align:middle line:90%
the second was Seth, et cetera.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Enoch was the seventh
before the Great Flood.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And the Bible said,
Enoch was the first human

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.770 align:middle line:84%
who disappeared in a flying
chariot from the Earth.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.980 align:middle line:84%
So the Jewish community
and the Christian community

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.370 align:middle line:84%
believes that Enoch
disappeared with God,

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:84%
but one day he has to
return with his body

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to die here on this planet.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So in the Bible, you have
only two phrases about Enoch.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So where does this book
of Enoch come from?

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.900 align:middle line:90%
180 years ago, a British--

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.714 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:33:38.714 --> 00:33:39.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Explorer.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Explorer-- British
explorer came to Ethiopia.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:45.950 align:middle line:84%
He was also looking
for God 180 years ago.

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And he went into a convent
and he learned the language

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.745 align:middle line:90%
of the Ethiopian at that time.

00:33:51.745 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And once he knew
the language, he

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.040 align:middle line:84%
went to the old
library of the convent.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the library, he
found the Book of Enoch.

00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.930 align:middle line:84%
He knew the word Enoch from the
Bible, but now a Book of Enoch.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So he translated the Book of
Enoch from old Ethiopian first

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.230 align:middle line:84%
into English, later from
English into German.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can only show
you a German version.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.116 align:middle line:10%
These are very
big, thick volumes.

00:34:15.116 --> 00:34:16.949 align:middle line:10%
The Apokryphen und
Pseudepigraphen des Alten

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:21.080 align:middle line:10%
Testments, by professional
doctor Emil Kautsch translated.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And in there, we find 126
pages about the Book of Enoch.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:28.969 align:middle line:10%
What is so fascinating
about Enoch?

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:30.889 align:middle line:90%
He writes in the first person.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I version, I witnessed,
not in the second person.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Not I hear, they told me.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.909 align:middle line:84%
No, he says what
happened to him.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:84%
So he describes that
he was 12 years old.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:47.582 align:middle line:84%
The whole village
wanted to go to sleep.

00:34:47.582 --> 00:34:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Then they hear the
noise in the sky

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.828 align:middle line:90%
and they saw a light in the sky.

00:34:50.828 --> 00:34:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And they all were afraid and
ran away, except, he said,

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.889 align:middle line:90%
I was standing there.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Then the light comes
down to the earth

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and two beings came
out close to Enoch.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The two beings in
glittering clothes.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:90%
It was all glittering.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, Enoch was afraid, too,
and he fell down on the ground.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.390 align:middle line:84%
He writes in his book,
I smelled the humanity--

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.320 align:middle line:84%
the humidity--
humidity of the Earth.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, all of a
sudden, he's taken up

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
and they showed
him that somebody

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.930 align:middle line:90%
speaks in his language.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.132 align:middle line:84%
Don't be afraid, human,
we won't hurt you.

00:35:27.132 --> 00:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, for the first time,
we have to ask ourselves,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.370 align:middle line:84%
how can that extraterrestrial
speak the language of Enoch?

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.620 align:middle line:90%
It's very easy.

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:42.290 align:middle line:84%
In our time, some 100 years
ago, our acknowledgists

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:46.340 align:middle line:84%
went to the upper Amazon River
or to the Upper Nile in Africa,

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.540 align:middle line:84%
and they came together
with different tribes.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, these different tribes
had wonderful cultures,

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.300 align:middle line:84%
but none of them
spoke English or

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.680 align:middle line:90%
German or Spanish or whatever--

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.640 align:middle line:90%
French.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.380 align:middle line:90%
They had their local language.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It was never a problem
for the acknowledgists

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:84%
to learn the language
of the natives.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of
three, four, five months

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and you can talk together.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:84%
These extraterrestrials who were
here thousands of years ago,

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:84%
they [INAUDIBLE] themselves
like today's acknowledgists

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:90%
would do.

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.660 align:middle line:84%
They observed a certain
group, and by observing,

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.100 align:middle line:90%
they learned their language.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.318 align:middle line:84%
With their technology,
computer, et cetera,

00:36:20.318 --> 00:36:22.360 align:middle line:84%
they would have learned
the language immediately,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.140 align:middle line:90%
probably in two or three weeks.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So when some of the
extraterrestrial

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:29.470 align:middle line:84%
speaks the language of
Enoch, I am not shocked.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely normal.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:31.980 align:middle line:90%
They can use it.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.230 align:middle line:84%
So the one says to
Enoch, don't be afraid,

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:middle line:90%
human, we won't hurt you.

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
They say, if you wish, we take
you with us and we teach you.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And the young Enoch, he's not
afraid, he says, yes, I wish.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So they take him away, they
bring him up to the sky.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.700 align:middle line:90%
He describes it in every detail.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
He sees giant objects
over the Earth.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he also
does not have a world

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.960 align:middle line:90%
like spaceship or mother--

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.990 align:middle line:84%
he says giant diamonds
were up there, glittering.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Doors opened, we
entered into the doors.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:06.380 align:middle line:90%
He came to different gardens.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.340 align:middle line:84%
He came to a big room with
a drone in the center,

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and there, the highest was
sitting, et cetera, et cetera.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Like Arjuna in the
Hindu mythology,

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Enoch learns the language
of these extraterrestrials.

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Once he knows the language,
they give him a writing device

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and they dictate him books,
many, many books, he said.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:33.070 align:middle line:84%
They dictated me
more than 100 books.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.860 align:middle line:84%
All books about science,
about astronomy,

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.870 align:middle line:90%
about the calendar, et cetera.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Enoch is the first
one, by the way,

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.840 align:middle line:84%
who gives the names of
these extraterrestrials.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.460 align:middle line:90%
They sound like this, look.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.810 align:middle line:10%
These are the names
of their leaders.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:10%
The name of the first is Jequin.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:10%
He's the one who seduced the
children of men, et cetera.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Enoch [INAUDIBLE] 36 languages.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:04.280 align:middle line:84%
So I even know the names of
these fellows who were here

00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.420 align:middle line:90%
thousands of years ago.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And this group of
human-like beings,

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.530 align:middle line:90%
obviously, they wanted sex.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.940 align:middle line:84%
They wanted sex with beautiful
daughters on this planet Earth,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.392 align:middle line:90%
and this was forbidden.

00:38:18.392 --> 00:38:19.850 align:middle line:84%
The commander of
the spaceship said

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:84%
you are not allowed to have
sexual contact with them.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.280 align:middle line:90%
So there was a mutiny on board.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.580 align:middle line:84%
They were against the
commander, and they went down

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and had sex with humans.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Enoch describes it like this.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:37.310 align:middle line:84%
"But when the sons of heaven
saw that the daughters of men

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:42.230 align:middle line:84%
were fair, they admired them
and desired to mate with them.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And they said to each other,
we will take them as wives.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.617 align:middle line:90%
All together, they were 200--"

00:38:50.617 --> 00:38:51.450 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Which descended--

00:38:52.283 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> "Which descended v upon the
mountain Hermon in the days

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.360 align:middle line:90%
of Jared."

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Jared is the father of Enoch.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:01.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you think, this
is, again, imagination.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Hey, some extraterrestrials
want to do sex with human.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, just
look at the Bible.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.130 align:middle line:90%
We have the same thing here.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.090 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible, the
first book of Moses,

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.640 align:middle line:84%
"when the humans began to
multiply and have daughters,

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.100 align:middle line:84%
the sons of the gods--"
in some translations,

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.410 align:middle line:84%
you can read, the
fallen angels--

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:24.850 align:middle line:84%
"saw that they were fair, and
they took them as their wives."

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Not only Enoch, the same
thing in Hindu mythology.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.940 align:middle line:84%
There was sex between
the extraterrestrials

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.010 align:middle line:90%
and the humans.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Why should they have the same
body, the same sexual apparatus

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.630 align:middle line:90%
as we?

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:40.690 align:middle line:84%
I come back to this at
the end of my speech.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So Enoch describes
what happened.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.680 align:middle line:84%
They dictate him
all kind of things.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:84%
One example I always hear from
the critics and the skeptics,

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.270 align:middle line:84%
come on, Erich, Enoch, the Book
of Enoch, this is all a dream.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.360 align:middle line:90%
He had a dream, that's all now.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Enoch describes, my
leader said to me, human,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:90%
look out of the window.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you see this little
light out there?

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.080 align:middle line:90%
You humans, you call it moon.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:84%
But the moon has
no light by itself.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The moon receives his
light from the sun.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he explains to him why
the moon sometimes disappear,

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.450 align:middle line:90%
is full, is half, et cetera.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The teacher of Enoch
says to him, young human,

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.960 align:middle line:84%
you see these glittering,
bright, shining light?

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.390 align:middle line:90%
You humans, you call it the sun.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:84%
You see the other little
lights here in the sky,

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.330 align:middle line:90%
on the night sky?

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:30.700 align:middle line:90%
You call it stars.

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Each star is a
sun, like your sun.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And he explains how
planetary systems function.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:41.500 align:middle line:84%
He explains that around
our sun, different planets

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:84%
turn, including the
Earth in 365 days,

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:51.170 align:middle line:84%
plus leap hours, not leap years,
leap hours, so very precise.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.020 align:middle line:90%
These are astronomical details.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.760 align:middle line:90%
This is scientific data.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.490 align:middle line:84%
You cannot dream that, a human
in Stone Age before the Great

00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:59.290 align:middle line:90%
Flood.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:02.230 align:middle line:90%


00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They also teach
him in astronomy,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.920 align:middle line:84%
they teach him in
calendar, they teach him

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.960 align:middle line:84%
in engineering, and
all kind of things.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And he writes all this, I handed
down to my son, Methuselah,

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.140 align:middle line:84%
with the order, you, my son,
Methuselah, keep all of this,

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.900 align:middle line:84%
keep it for the
human generations

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.090 align:middle line:90%
after the Great Flood.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.500 align:middle line:84%
They told him that the gigantic
Great Flood would come.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.000 align:middle line:90%
You remember the Great Flood?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Everybody remembers that.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Bible they said, well,
it was a punishment of God.

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.050 align:middle line:84%
But I know 100
mythologies of the planet,

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and in every mythology,
you have a Great Flood.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:84%
The Indians in the high land
of Columbia or the Indians

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:84%
somewhere-- the
Eskimos in Alaska,

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE],, the Inuit, it
doesn't matter, far in Africa,

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:84%
they all know the story
of the Great Flood.

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And you remember, it was always
a so-called god who descended,

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.880 align:middle line:84%
who warned the group of
the human, who warned them

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:84%
in at once a gigantic
flood would come.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.807 align:middle line:84%
None of these gods
was an omnipotent god,

00:42:06.807 --> 00:42:08.390 align:middle line:84%
could not, like a
miracle, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:90%
[SNAPS]

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Here, you have a ship.

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Now they give them order,
you have to construct a ship.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:20.550 align:middle line:84%
To construct the ship means
falling trees, measurement,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.420 align:middle line:84%
building, to construct
a ship is technology,

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to construct a ship,
this takes at least one

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.590 align:middle line:90%
year, if not more than one year.

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.730 align:middle line:84%
So all these
so-called gods, they

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.930 align:middle line:84%
knew at least one year ahead
that the gigantic flood

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.010 align:middle line:90%
was coming.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Not like just our weather
forecast, where in two weeks,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.260 align:middle line:90%
it will rain.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.130 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:46.980 align:middle line:90%
It was planned long before.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they could
not build a ship.

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Technology, they
knew it exactly.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.810 align:middle line:84%
So they did it and
they survived it.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And then all our forefather's
prehistoric time,

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.260 align:middle line:84%
everything was
destroyed by the flood.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to reprint to show
they're coming generations

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.320 align:middle line:90%
how the gods looked like.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:90%
Very brief.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.660 align:middle line:84%
This is near Switzerland
in the border to Italia.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It's called [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:84%
This here is in your country,
Arizona, of the Hopi territory.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:20.850 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.850 align:middle line:84%
When you fly to Nazca in
Peru, this gigantic figure

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.510 align:middle line:90%
here is 29 meters high.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.880 align:middle line:84%
One arm pointed to the sky, the
other pointed to the ground.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.320 align:middle line:90%
29 meters high.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Flying on the way to Nazca,
direct before the plain

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.720 align:middle line:90%
of Nazca.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Even in archeology, they call
it the great [? martian ?] god.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.130 align:middle line:84%
All these so-called gods,
here, you cannot see nothing

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.260 align:middle line:84%
because it's near
the city of Ica.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Ica is in Peru.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.070 align:middle line:84%
This finger points
directly to the sky.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.570 align:middle line:90%
It looks like this.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:57.268 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see it from the
ground, you have to fly.

00:43:57.268 --> 00:43:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you have
no change to see.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.241 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.310 align:middle line:90%
The Sahara Desert, Africa.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.390 align:middle line:84%
It's far away from South
America, from Nazca, far away

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.440 align:middle line:84%
from the Hopi Indians
in your country.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Look at this.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:10%
The original figure is 6
meters high, 6,000 years old.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.520 align:middle line:84%
This continues all
over the world.

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.200 align:middle line:90%
This is in Australia.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.740 align:middle line:84%
The so-called gods were always
represented with helmets,

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.130 align:middle line:84%
with halos, with rays
around their heads.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.220 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is again, Australia.

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You all realize that
between Australia,

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.860 align:middle line:84%
between North America,
Hopi territory,

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.150 align:middle line:84%
between South America, Nazca,
Peru, between the Sahara Desert

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.080 align:middle line:84%
are thousands and thousands of
kilometers, there are oceans.

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.570 align:middle line:84%
In our prehistoric
time, our forefathers

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.520 align:middle line:90%
had no contact together.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:84%
You could not just book a
flight over there to Las Vegas.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.120 align:middle line:84%
So why have they
represented their gods

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.170 align:middle line:84%
all in the same manner,
with helmets and halos

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.240 align:middle line:90%
around their heads worldwide?

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And the people had no
contact between each other.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.420 align:middle line:10%
Later, they learned to
chisel, to make figures.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.960 align:middle line:10%
This is in Tulum, Tulum is
Mexico, not far from here,

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.820 align:middle line:10%
directly on the Caribbean Sea.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.880 align:middle line:10%
The whole city-- the
Mayan city of Tulum

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.580 align:middle line:10%
is dedicated to
the ascending gods.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:28.290 align:middle line:84%
You see spread legs here and
the head, and then his hands,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:33.420 align:middle line:84%
like somebody is
lying on a bobsledder.

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.660 align:middle line:90%
And he always has wings.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.700 align:middle line:90%
They fly down from the sky.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.790 align:middle line:90%
They are represented like this.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:44.030 align:middle line:84%
The whole city of
Tulum is dedicated

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.540 align:middle line:90%
to the descending gods in Maya.

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then worldwide, what we had
in cave paintings before,

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:84%
later, when they learned to make
figures, to chisel, to paint,

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:90%
they represented their gods.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.440 align:middle line:84%
This is in the Museum
of Guatemala City.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.380 align:middle line:84%
But the world is
full of these things.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.850 align:middle line:90%
This is in Japan.

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, today's Guatemala had
nothing to do with Japan.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:90%
This is prehistoric Japan.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.260 align:middle line:84%
They call it
[INAUDIBLE] figures.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The prehistoric
Japanese people believed

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.830 align:middle line:90%
that this was one of the gods.

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But also, in prehistoric
times, the Japanese

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.630 align:middle line:90%
knew nothing about glasses yet.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.330 align:middle line:90%
So what have they copied?

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Why have they represented
the gods worldwide

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:27.680 align:middle line:90%
in the same ways?

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.940 align:middle line:84%
This one here, this
[? sense, ?] he has a helmet on,

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.290 align:middle line:84%
he has a [INAUDIBLE]
on his lips,

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.612 align:middle line:84%
his hands are bending
down, his feet upward.

00:46:36.612 --> 00:46:37.820 align:middle line:90%
This you'll find in La Venta.

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.420 align:middle line:84%
La Venta is near the city
of Villahermosa in Mexico.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.300 align:middle line:90%
He descends to the humans.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:47.960 align:middle line:84%
In your country, the
Hopi Indians in Arizona--

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.960 align:middle line:84%
just go to the Hopi Indians and
go to the souvenir shop there.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:10%
You'll find some
of these pictures

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:10%
and some of these figures.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:10%
They are called kachina figures.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Then you ask the
Hopi literature,

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:01.400 align:middle line:84%
the book of the Hopi, which
is scientific literature, what

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.420 align:middle line:90%
is the kachinas?

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.850 align:middle line:84%
What did they mean
with kachinas?

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.260 align:middle line:84%
The kachinas were the
spiritual teachers from heaven

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.350 align:middle line:84%
who descended to the
forefathers of the Hopi.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:16.070 align:middle line:84%
They teach them in astronomy
in different belongings.

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.045 align:middle line:90%
And the Hopi, to day, still--

00:47:18.045 --> 00:47:19.098 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:19.098 --> 00:47:20.562 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:47:20.562 --> 00:47:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The Hopi, still today,
make these figures,

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:24.080 align:middle line:90%
the kachina figures.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.420 align:middle line:84%
You can buy them
in souvenir shops.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.780 align:middle line:84%
Kachina pictures
simply do not forget

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.190 align:middle line:84%
that these gods were
there, our teacher

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.910 align:middle line:84%
some thousands of years
ago, and they promised

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.770 align:middle line:90%
to return in the future.

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.395 align:middle line:84%
So we should not forget
the visit of the gods

00:47:39.395 --> 00:47:42.080 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago because
they will return,

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:90%
so that we are not afraid.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is today's North
America here in your country.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, take 12,000 kilometers
away from here down

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.980 align:middle line:90%
to South America.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with an Indian
tribe called the Kayapo.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:59.360 align:middle line:84%
The Kayapo live on the
upper Amazon River.

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Every year they
have a festivity.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.750 align:middle line:84%
On this festivity, their shaman
dresses in a straw garment,

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.160 align:middle line:90%
completely covered.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:11.900 align:middle line:84%
He has no openings for
eyes, mouth, nose, nothing.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And they dance around
this straw man.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.320 align:middle line:90%
You will just see him.

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.330 align:middle line:90%
And they sing the story.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Long, long time ago, for their
forefathers, all of a sudden

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:23.060 align:middle line:90%
there was a noise in the sky.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And a being descended,
a big being.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.320 align:middle line:90%
They were all afraid.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.320 align:middle line:84%
Finally, they realized
he did not harm them.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.880 align:middle line:84%
They came down out
of the village.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Now you see the man coming
here in this corner.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Within four days,
the stranger learned

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.360 align:middle line:84%
the language of the
native, and he told

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:43.080 align:middle line:90%
them his name was [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] means I
come from the firmament.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:84%
He taught them
several belongings,

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:54.160 align:middle line:84%
as the other cases in
astronomy, in agriculture.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.140 align:middle line:84%
He taught them in
some forms of weapon,

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.770 align:middle line:84%
how it was easier to
make casings, et cetera.

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And before he left, he
promised in the far future

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.770 align:middle line:90%
he will return again.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And in order not to
forget his visit,

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:13.900 align:middle line:84%
they represent every year
this heavenly teacher

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.080 align:middle line:84%
in the form of a straw garment,
straw man with no opening

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:20.710 align:middle line:90%
for mouth or ears, et cetera.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.790 align:middle line:90%
He was a teacher from the sky.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we have such a
thing only in North America,

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.110 align:middle line:90%
the Hopis now, its worldwide.

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So what do we need more
about all these things?

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They were here and we have
their reports practically

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.490 align:middle line:90%
in every culture.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why this is
so complicated to understand,

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:46.180 align:middle line:84%
why our scientific community,
especially our archaeologists

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.110 align:middle line:84%
and technologists,
they are so blind.

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:51.900 align:middle line:84%
They cannot see it or
they don't know it.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I love discussions
with skeptics.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful because they
lose anyhow, it doesn't matter.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.800 align:middle line:90%
But I love the discussions.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And when we respect each
other, when we are not

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.930 align:middle line:84%
lying and bluffing and
discussing honestly,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:07.110 align:middle line:84%
after two hours, they
always confess to me, Erich,

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.072 align:middle line:90%
we didn't know that.

00:50:08.072 --> 00:50:09.780 align:middle line:84%
We never hear about
these books, we never

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.550 align:middle line:84%
hear the word of Enoch
or Ezekiel or anything.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:14.130 align:middle line:90%
We don't know it.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Soon as we know it, it all fits
together, the cave paintings,

00:50:18.090 --> 00:50:22.890 align:middle line:84%
the figures, the old writings,
and all these things here.

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.822 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to change
the theme very briefly,

00:50:24.822 --> 00:50:26.530 align:middle line:84%
because something I
have to explain here,

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:29.958 align:middle line:90%
which nerves me every year.

00:50:29.958 --> 00:50:30.916 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:30.916 --> 00:50:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh?

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:32.338 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:32.338 --> 00:50:33.532 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:33.532 --> 00:50:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Ah, Chariots of the Gods.

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.693 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:50:35.693 --> 00:50:37.820 align:middle line:90%
Talking Chariots of the Gods.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:90%
[COUGHING]

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:41.490 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come from smoke.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:45.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't smoke, at
least not much.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So in Chariots of
the Gods, the cover

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:51.510 align:middle line:90%
show the picture of Palenque.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Palenque is a Maya city
in Central America.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And in Palenque, there
are different pyramids

00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.315 align:middle line:90%
they call temples.

00:50:59.315 --> 00:51:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of these
step pyramids is

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.820 align:middle line:84%
called the Temple
of Inscription,

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.360 align:middle line:84%
because up there, they
found 812 inscriptions.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And in 1952, professional
Dr. [? Ruth ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:13.710 align:middle line:84%
found this covered
up here a groove

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:15.960 align:middle line:84%
in the ground, a
groove in the bottom.

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.320 align:middle line:84%
And they chiseled it out,
and inside the pyramid,

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.070 align:middle line:90%
there was a staircase.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But in 1951, the staircase was
completely filled with stone.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.280 align:middle line:84%
It took three years before all
these stones were taken out

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.600 align:middle line:90%
of the staircase.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Three years later, they landed
under the pyramid, seven meters

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:36.670 align:middle line:90%
under the pyramid.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:39.990 align:middle line:84%
They were standing before a big
door in the form of a triangle.

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:42.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the first time
we had such a door

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.560 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a triangle.

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.080 align:middle line:90%
The door was opened, roughly.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:48.320 align:middle line:90%
They destroyed it partly.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.440 align:middle line:84%
The grid was made
only for the visitors.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.300 align:middle line:90%
And then they stood in a room.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.790 align:middle line:90%
The room was 7 meters high.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And from the ceiling
to down, the room

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.750 align:middle line:84%
was full with stalactites
and stalagmites,

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.790 align:middle line:84%
you know these
[INAUDIBLE],, who grow.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.260 align:middle line:84%
That means the room is very,
very, very old, thousands

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of years older
than the pyramid itself.

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Later, the pyramid was
constructed over the room.

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The room existed a
long time before.

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And there was this bottom
plate 3 meters long,

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.630 align:middle line:84%
2 meter, [? 20 large, ?]
one block.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And under the plate,
an incredible drawing.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.230 align:middle line:84%
You will just see it
something like a frame.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:37.940 align:middle line:84%
In the center of
the frame is someone

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:43.220 align:middle line:84%
sitting, bending forward, almost
like a motor racing cyclist.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.290 align:middle line:84%
He has an oxygen
mask on his nose.

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:48.050 align:middle line:10%
He uses up a hand, you
will just see it here,

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.752 align:middle line:10%
his upper hands to
manipulate control.

00:52:50.752 --> 00:52:53.470 align:middle line:10%
You see the lower hands,
you see the forefingers.

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:55.230 align:middle line:10%
He's winding up something.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.310 align:middle line:10%
He's sitting on a chair.

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.360 align:middle line:10%
And outside of the frame--

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.450 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Outside of the frame, you
see a linking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:09.340 align:middle line:90%
Now, this was found in 1952.

00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:12.505 align:middle line:84%
Of course, archeology had
immediately their explanation--

00:53:12.505 --> 00:53:13.630 align:middle line:90%
archaeological explanation.

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:16.300 align:middle line:10%
They said, it represents Pakal.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.990 align:middle line:10%
Pakal was the second to last
ruler of the city of Palenque.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:23.080 align:middle line:10%
And Pakal is sitting
in the open mouth

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.220 align:middle line:10%
of a mythological monster.

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:27.596 align:middle line:90%
You see what [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:27.596 --> 00:53:31.120 align:middle line:84%
But you see here,
these two things here.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.483 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE] the piece, the
upper teeth and the lower teeth.

00:53:34.483 --> 00:53:36.375 align:middle line:10%
That's the open mouth
of a mythical monster.

00:53:36.375 --> 00:53:38.740 align:middle line:10%
Pakal is falling
into the monster.

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:42.051 align:middle line:10%
Out of his body comes the tree
of life, the cross of life,

00:53:42.051 --> 00:53:43.860 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, et cetera.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:46.410 align:middle line:10%
All archaeological nonsense.

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.870 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.350 align:middle line:84%
In the meantime, more
than 50 years have passed,

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and they have learned
much more than before.

00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.130 align:middle line:90%
There is writing all around.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
professor Dr.

00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.390 align:middle line:84%
[? Stewart ?] and
[? Stewart-- ?] it's the father

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and the son, [? Stewart, ?]
both brilliant American

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:84%
archaeologists,
Mayan specialists.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.760 align:middle line:84%
They now are able to
translate the writing around,

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:09.923 align:middle line:90%
and they said, yes--

00:54:09.923 --> 00:54:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that's the most
modern explanation

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.520 align:middle line:84%
now after 50 years--
yes, it represents Pakal,

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.630 align:middle line:84%
but it had nothing to
do with the open mouth

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:19.980 align:middle line:84%
of a mythological monster,
nothing with the tree of life,

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:84%
nothing with the stylized hairs
of the beard of the weather

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.130 align:middle line:84%
god, and all that's
rubbish which we are told.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.170 align:middle line:84%
The whole plate,
the stone plate has

00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to do completely with the
cosmos and with the universe.

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Pakal is leaving planet Earth.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.590 align:middle line:84%
I am always accused
by the skeptics.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I am not allowed to look at
these pictures crosswise.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I should look at it lengthwise.

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Lengthwise, it looks like this.

00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now you know I am
a man with fantasy.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.920 align:middle line:10%
And they tell me, that's
the only correct way

00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:10%
to look at the plate.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Say, OK, my fantasy jumps to
another continent far away

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.610 align:middle line:10%
from Central America.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to Indonesia.

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:08.990 align:middle line:90%


00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:12.440 align:middle line:84%
In Indonesia is a big
temple called the Borobudur.

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.110 align:middle line:84%
The Borobudur is composited
of hundreds of hundreds

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:17.240 align:middle line:90%
of these stupas.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.920 align:middle line:90%
These figures are called stupa.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.100 align:middle line:90%
For us, they look like a bell.

00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Stupas.

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Buddhism, the stupa
has different meanings.

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.560 align:middle line:84%
One of the meanings is
the stupa is the smaller

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:33.360 align:middle line:84%
vehicle with which you can reach
the big vehicle of the god.

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.140 align:middle line:84%
You remember, Arjuna
was taken in a vimana

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.550 align:middle line:90%
up to the mother spaceship.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:42.823 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel was taken in a smaller
vehicle up to the mountain,

00:55:42.823 --> 00:55:43.990 align:middle line:90%
mother spaceship, et cetera.

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So you always have
a smaller vehicle.

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:49.110 align:middle line:84%
So with this, they
believe the stupa

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:52.530 align:middle line:84%
is the smaller vehicle
in which you can reach

00:55:52.530 --> 00:55:54.730 align:middle line:90%
the big vehicle of the gods.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, every stupa is not empty.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:55:59.310 align:middle line:84%
In every stupa
somebody is sitting.

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:02.790 align:middle line:84%
In that case, the young Buddha,
because it's a Buddhist temple.

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:04.230 align:middle line:90%
What is he doing here?

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.145 align:middle line:84%
He's sitting there
with his two arms

00:56:06.145 --> 00:56:09.690 align:middle line:84%
here making some
movements, sitting

00:56:09.690 --> 00:56:12.630 align:middle line:84%
because he believes he's
in the small vehicle

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to reach the big
vehicle of the gods.

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Now look at this.

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.440 align:middle line:90%
Just look at the [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Here, we have Palenque.

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.310 align:middle line:10%
It becomes a stupa.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:24.110 align:middle line:90%
And it is obvious.

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:28.223 align:middle line:90%


00:56:28.223 --> 00:56:32.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It's all a question with
what eyes we look at it.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But finally, worldwide,
it's a similar tradition

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.350 align:middle line:84%
in different forms,
different worlds.

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:45.000 align:middle line:90%
And this continues.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.640 align:middle line:84%
What I said before, what
nerves me, what makes me crazy

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.890 align:middle line:90%
every year is Nazca.

00:56:49.890 --> 00:56:51.720 align:middle line:90%
You all remember Nazca.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.540 align:middle line:84%
What do I have against
the scientists in Nazca?

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Nazca is this gigantic desert,
roughly 500 kilometers south

00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:00.540 align:middle line:90%
of Lima in Peru.

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:03.060 align:middle line:84%
When you fly over
Nazca, first, you

00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.140 align:middle line:84%
see nothing, simply a desert
with brown and yellow stones

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.130 align:middle line:90%
and sand.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
you see some figures,

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.140 align:middle line:84%
figures of fishes,
monkeys, spiders,

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.460 align:middle line:90%
and all kind of things.

00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:16.500 align:middle line:84%
But they're such
over-dimensional size that you

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.360 align:middle line:90%
can see them only from the air.

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Then you fly a little higher,
than you see something

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.650 align:middle line:90%
which looks like airstrips.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.330 align:middle line:90%
Starts abruptly, ends abruptly.

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:30.270 align:middle line:84%
The longest of these lines
is 3.8 kilometers long,

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.110 align:middle line:90%
the longest.

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:32.867 align:middle line:90%
Then you see smaller lines.

00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:34.950 align:middle line:84%
There are these airstrip
lines, [INAUDIBLE] lines,

00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:36.060 align:middle line:90%
and smaller ones.

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:41.180 align:middle line:84%
The longest of the small
lines is 23 kilometers long.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.850 align:middle line:90%
Straight ahead-- huh?

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that in miles?

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.282 align:middle line:90%
>> 23 kilometers.

00:57:47.282 --> 00:57:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's around 18.

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>> About 18 kilometers.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> 18 miles.

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, miles.

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:54.200 align:middle line:90%
18 miles, roughly.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So what nerves me here,
practically every year

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:02.660 align:middle line:84%
on all television, you see
so-called documentaries.

00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And when the normal
people see a documentary,

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:08.660 align:middle line:84%
they believe this is science,
this is real science.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:11.120 align:middle line:90%
They teach us what is seen.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:14.970 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, they
don't show us the reality.

00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:20.150 align:middle line:84%
I show 20 pictures about
Nazca which you have never

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:24.570 align:middle line:84%
seen, neither in the
scientific textbook,

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.090 align:middle line:90%
neither in the documentaries.

00:58:26.090 --> 00:58:28.970 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.990 align:middle line:90%
This is Nazca-- original Nazca.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:41.970 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Nazca.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:47.220 align:middle line:84%
But what they show you on
TV are just the figures--

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.900 align:middle line:84%
the fishes, the monkeys,
the spiders, and so on.

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And they explain to you,
it's very, very easy

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:53.220 align:middle line:90%
to make these figures.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.030 align:middle line:10%
And really, it is easy, it's
not the complicated thing.

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.370 align:middle line:10%
You just had to scratch away
the surface, the stones.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And normally, a bright
shining surface appears.

00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:04.830 align:middle line:84%
And with this method,
you can make figures.

00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
mystery of Nazca.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.980 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The mystery of Nazca
are these lines.

00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And they never show these
lines on television.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:19.860 align:middle line:84%
I said, the longest of it
is 3.8 kilometers long.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Look at this picture.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.080 align:middle line:90%
Put it in your brain.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.710 align:middle line:90%
See it in your brain.

00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:25.640 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.940 align:middle line:90%
See it in your brain.

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.920 align:middle line:84%
You never see it on
television, neither

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.800 align:middle line:90%
in scientific textbooks.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.210 align:middle line:84%
They suggest to you the mystery
of Nazca are these figures.

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The figures are not
the mystery of Nazca.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.470 align:middle line:90%
This is the mystery of Nazca.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.120 align:middle line:90%
Then you see whole mountain.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.340 align:middle line:90%
The mountain top is cut off--

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:49.510 align:middle line:90%
completely cut off artificially.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:52.491 align:middle line:84%
You see under the lines
there are zig-zags.

00:59:52.491 --> 00:59:54.850 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.620 align:middle line:90%
You see zig-zag imagery.

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.120 align:middle line:84%
If this would be the result of
scratching away the surface,

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.750 align:middle line:84%
the stone of the
surface, then you

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:06.150 align:middle line:84%
would have scratched away the
zig-zag line behind it also.

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:12.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all not true, what they
teach us in the documentaries.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what nerves me.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And because it nerves
me, all these things,

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.340 align:middle line:84%
we have decided to clarify
all this scientifically.

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Until today, only archaeologists
have been working there.

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.560 align:middle line:90%
I adore archeology.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:28.640 align:middle line:90%
That's wonderful.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
The archaeologists I know
are brilliant people.

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not a question of
conspiracy, et cetera.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But archaeologists are
asking different questions.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.480 align:middle line:90%
They are asking, how old is it?

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.800 align:middle line:90%
How old is this spoon?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.480 align:middle line:90%
How old is this fire, et cetera?

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.850 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's called
a temple, et cetera?

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I have complete
different questions.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.350 align:middle line:84%
I want to know, what is
the chemical composition

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
of these lines?

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Is it different than the
next composition of the sand?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to know, what is the
resistance in electricity?

01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Are there some
magnetical anomalies?

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to find out on the
scientific way what's wrong--

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
compare these lines,
compare it with the desert

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:10.580 align:middle line:90%
just next to the lines.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the Erich
Von Daniken Foundation--

01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I had the idea to make a
scientific expedition there.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
We found six universities who
work together with the Erich

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.080 align:middle line:90%
Von Daniken Foundation.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
One university is the University
[? Catolica ?] in Lima, Peru,

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.598 align:middle line:84%
because you need the local
university [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:29.598 --> 01:01:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Without that, you would
never get the permission.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
Then we have two
German universities,

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:37.340 align:middle line:90%
a Swiss university, et cetera.

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:39.050 align:middle line:84%
For a scientific
analysis of this,

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
we need roughly 240,000 euros--

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.240 align:middle line:90%
comparable 240,000 euros.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But all these universities
are working together.

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
What is left, what we don't have
is about $60,000 we're left.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:57.830 align:middle line:10%
That's why we decided to look
to find this missing $60,000

01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:00.080 align:middle line:10%
by crowd funding.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.990 align:middle line:10%
Look at this up there,
the red writing.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:04.400 align:middle line:10%
Take your note.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.250 align:middle line:10%
When you are home,
please go in there.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.880 align:middle line:10%
Look what I say in there, what
the idea is, what universities

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.340 align:middle line:10%
are working with it, the
names of the figures,

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:15.100 align:middle line:10%
what the plan is.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.120 align:middle line:10%
And maybe you have
the idea, OK, I

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.080 align:middle line:10%
spend $20 or whatever
for the crowd funding.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.150 align:middle line:10%
Because we want to realize this.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:26.810 align:middle line:10%
We will start this in fall, that
this international scientific

01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.460 align:middle line:10%
team goes to Nazca
and makes finally

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:37.600 align:middle line:10%
scientific analysis, not
only archaeological analysis.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
In the textbooks-- in
the scientific textbook

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.370 align:middle line:84%
about Nazca, I
have learned so far

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.180 align:middle line:90%
what is it, all these lines.

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a code for
the weather gods.

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It's an astronomical calendar.

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a code for agriculture.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a pre-Inca sport place,
some sort of pre-Inca olympia.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.930 align:middle line:90%
It's copies of a Fata Morgana.

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:01.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a start place
of hot air balloon.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:05.800 align:middle line:84%
These are acre plots, boundary
makers, procession street,

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.760 align:middle line:90%
maps.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.590 align:middle line:90%
It's all rubbish.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if all of you have
this explanation in archeology,

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:13.690 align:middle line:90%
where are--

01:03:13.690 --> 01:03:14.860 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:15.900 align:middle line:90%
--the footprints?

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Where are the footprints of
the people going to the lines?

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The lines start
abruptly, end abruptly,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.360 align:middle line:84%
as if somebody from
the air has come

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.970 align:middle line:84%
and not somebody
walked through it.

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
find out all this.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.680 align:middle line:90%


01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Some 2 and 1/2 thousand years
from now, the Greek historian,

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus-- you learned
Herodotus in school.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Man called him the
father of history.

01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:45.840 align:middle line:84%
He was in Egypt, 450 BC, 2 and
1/2 thousand years from now.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.800 align:middle line:90%
He was there for many years.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.710 align:middle line:90%
And he also was in Thebes.

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Thebes is today's
Luxor on the Nile.

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And in his second
book of history,

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Herodotus writes,
the high priest

01:03:56.430 --> 01:04:02.940 align:middle line:84%
showed him 241 statues, one
statue next to the other.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest gave to
every statue an explanation.

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:09.180 align:middle line:84%
He explained what his name was
and he was leaving from then

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.350 align:middle line:90%
to them, et cetera.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And at the end,
after 241 statues,

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the high priest
said to Herodotus,

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:21.630 align:middle line:84%
these 241 statues
represent 11,340 years.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
At their time, the
gods from the firmament

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.370 align:middle line:90%
were among the humans.

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:28.860 align:middle line:90%
11,340 years.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, Herodotus
made this statement

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 thousand
years from now,

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
which means I have to add 2
and 1/2 thousand to the 11,340,

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
roughly 14,000
years ago, according

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
to the father of
history, Herodotus,

01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:46.570 align:middle line:90%
the extraterrestrials were here.

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in archeology, they
never took Herodotus by word.

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
According to archeology,
the history of old Egypt

01:04:54.860 --> 01:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
starts roughly 3000
BC, but not 14,000 BC.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.920 align:middle line:90%
They said, what is he talking?

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.580 align:middle line:90%
Why is he telling rubbish?

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
The same Herodotus,
just a few lines later,

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.650 align:middle line:84%
in his second book of
history, you can control it,

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Chapter 141, 142, he says
that under the Great Pyramid

01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:19.400 align:middle line:84%
there is a lake, and
the lake is clear water.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And the clear water--

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:22.640 align:middle line:90%
there is a sea.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
In archeology, they never
took this for serious.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we slowly go
into the pyramid.

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:31.190 align:middle line:84%
I show you the lake, the
sea, and the detail of it.

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:43.010 align:middle line:10%
But the entry was

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:50.060 align:middle line:90%


01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
This is called the upcoming
shaft, 23-meter long.

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:58.010 align:middle line:84%
You can climb up there,
but only one meter high.

01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:59.670 align:middle line:90%
You have go down on your knees.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
After 23 meters, you come to
the so-called great gallery.

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:05.070 align:middle line:90%
There's the great gallery.

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.980 align:middle line:90%
This is 47 meters long.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.360 align:middle line:90%
Imagine that.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.620 align:middle line:90%
8 and 1/2 meter height.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And here starts
the first question.

01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Why have the builders, the
constructors of the pyramid,

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:20.910 align:middle line:84%
first constructed this small
shaft so small that you cannot

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:23.670 align:middle line:84%
even transport a
sarcophagus in there?

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And then after 23 meters,
this gigantic thing,

01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:27.910 align:middle line:90%
we don't understand it.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Then you came to two chambers.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
One chamber is called
the King's Chamber,

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
the other chamber is
called the Queen's Chamber.

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:34.930 align:middle line:90%
It looks like this.

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.852 align:middle line:84%
Now we go into the
Queen's Chamber.

01:06:36.852 --> 01:06:38.310 align:middle line:84%
That's this one
here in the middle.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:41.110 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:43.860 align:middle line:90%


01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:49.220 align:middle line:84%
In the Queen's Chamber,
there is a hole in the wall.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.030 align:middle line:84%
This hole exists on the south
side and on the north side.

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important
to know, this hole

01:06:55.730 --> 01:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
exists only since about
180 years before the wall

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:02.960 align:middle line:90%
was closed.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Then a British
explorer came there

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.032 align:middle line:84%
and he was looking
for [? trestles. ?]

01:07:08.032 --> 01:07:08.990 align:middle line:90%
He had a little hammer.

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:12.240 align:middle line:84%
He was hammering all the time on
the wall and they sound hollow.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.160 align:middle line:90%
And then they opened the wall.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So in the beginning,
this was not there.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, inside the hole
there's a shaft.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
You point in with
your beam, you see

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
there's a shaft going
about 2 meters horizontal,

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and then starts
claiming in there now.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:30.497 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:07:30.497 --> 01:07:32.330 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine,
[? Rudolf ?] [INAUDIBLE],,

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:33.610 align:middle line:90%
constructed the robot.

01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:35.920 align:middle line:90%
That's now over 20 years ago.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
This robot is a
steel construction,

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.730 align:middle line:84%
and we entered the shaft going
out from the Queen's Chamber.

01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:46.840 align:middle line:84%
First, the 2 meters
horizontal, and then the robot

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.320 align:middle line:90%
climbs up inside the shaft.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:55.000 align:middle line:84%
In whole archeology,
the specialists told us,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
the shaft is only
about 8 meters long.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
After 8 meters, it
comes to a blind end.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But the robot continues,
as you will just see.

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:11.060 align:middle line:84%
First, 2 meter horizontal, then
starts the climbing inside.

01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So the archaeologists
believed after 8 meter,

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.500 align:middle line:90%
it came to a standstill.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.689 align:middle line:90%
But that was not correct.

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:19.850 align:middle line:90%
The robot continued.

01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Inside, he passed the 8 meter
mark, continued climbing

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.700 align:middle line:90%
inside the pyramid--

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:29.330 align:middle line:84%
10 meter, 12 meter,
15 meter, 20 meter.

01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists could
not aspire anymore.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.702 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't
understand what's going

01:08:32.702 --> 01:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
on here in the Great Pyramid.

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:35.960 align:middle line:90%
He climbed up.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.670 align:middle line:90%
Always the wall changed--

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:40.189 align:middle line:84%
it was [INAUDIBLE],,
it was sandstone,

01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
it was basalt, all kind
of different stone.

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You saw openings who
looked like doors.

01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:48.649 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have to
understand, this shaft

01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:52.729 align:middle line:84%
is only 14 centimeter
by one side.

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:55.319 align:middle line:84%
You cannot send a man in
there to climb in there.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:58.229 align:middle line:90%
Only with a robot it's possible.

01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:02.319 align:middle line:84%
After 62 meters, the
robot came to a standstill

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.319 align:middle line:90%
before a little door.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.479 align:middle line:84%
The little door had
something like two bracelets.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:07.650 align:middle line:90%
You will just see it.

01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:10.441 align:middle line:84%
There was scratchings
on the wall.

01:09:10.441 --> 01:09:12.399 align:middle line:84%
So thousands of years
ago in the past, somebody

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
must have pressed
something inside here,

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:18.840 align:middle line:90%
which left traces behind.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.479 align:middle line:84%
The stones here of this
wall are alabaster.

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:25.649 align:middle line:84%
Alabaster looks like
[? marrow. ?] Very,

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:27.290 align:middle line:90%
very polished, very precise.

01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:38.689 align:middle line:90%


01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:42.590 align:middle line:84%
So these pictures were
taken roughly 25 years ago

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.569 align:middle line:84%
by this small robot
you saw before.

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:47.710 align:middle line:90%


01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:50.260 align:middle line:84%
There was a stone
blocking the continuation,

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:51.819 align:middle line:90%
but the robot made it.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:56.450 align:middle line:84%
He overtook this blocking,
continued his trip inside.

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
This was meter 32.

01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
He continued-- 40 meters, 50
meters, 60 meters At 62 meter,

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
the robot came to a standstill
before a small door.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And the small door
had something like two

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.282 align:middle line:90%
little metallic bracelets.

01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:12.240 align:middle line:90%
You will just see them.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.140 align:middle line:90%


01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.760 align:middle line:90%
The wall here is alabaster.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
You see how polished
and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, you are 62
meters inside the pyramid,

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.818 align:middle line:84%
starting from the
Queen's Chamber.

01:10:25.818 --> 01:10:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> How much [INAUDIBLE].

>> The metallic bracelets.

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.600 align:middle line:90%


01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Now watch the next picture.

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:51.730 align:middle line:84%
The robot had a laser,
and the laser beam

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
will touch this door, and
the laser beam will go under.

01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:02.020 align:middle line:84%
You see the direct point here
down from the laser beam.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And the laser beam
will be crossed

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:07.060 align:middle line:84%
under the door, which
means there must

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.070 align:middle line:90%
be something behind this door.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
This cannot be the
end of the shaft.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.340 align:middle line:90%


01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, all this
was 25 years ago.

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:21.950 align:middle line:10%
What happened since that?

01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:24.050 align:middle line:10%
At that time, 25
years ago, publish

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:25.608 align:middle line:10%
was more or less informed.

01:11:25.608 --> 01:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
There was a robot in there,
but you hear nothing.

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.222 align:middle line:90%
What happened since then?

01:11:29.222 --> 01:11:31.730 align:middle line:90%
You hear nothing in the public.

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:36.770 align:middle line:84%
After this demonstration
here, the American National

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Geographic Society
came down to Egypt

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and they constructed
the new robot.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And the new robot,
he had a drilling--

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.700 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And with the drilling, they
made a hole into this door.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:51.172 align:middle line:90%
You see here.

01:11:51.172 --> 01:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%


01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And they pushed
the light inside.

01:11:57.630 --> 01:12:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And all what they could see,
there was nothing behind it,

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.410 align:middle line:90%
except the next wall.

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
It was empty, then
you see the next wall.

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
That was the situation
roughly 18 years ago.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:13.720 align:middle line:90%
What happened since then?

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.370 align:middle line:84%
A rich man from
Singapore, he wanted

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:17.850 align:middle line:90%
to know what's behind it.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And he gave the order to
construct another robot, robot

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.430 align:middle line:90%
number three.

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
The first robot was from
[INAUDIBLE],, the German.

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
The second from your
National Geographic Society.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Now the third robot
constructed by this rich Hindu

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:34.600 align:middle line:90%
man from Singapore.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.494 align:middle line:90%
And he called it the Jedi Robot.

01:12:37.494 --> 01:12:39.230 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Funny.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They made a hole again
through this wall, you see.

01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
There's the first wall with
these two metallic bracelets.

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Then comes the next wall,
and now he makes a hole

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:50.480 align:middle line:90%
into the next wall.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
A small hole, just big
enough for an endoscope.

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:57.252 align:middle line:84%
They put an endoscope
through it, some light.

01:12:57.252 --> 01:13:01.610 align:middle line:90%


01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.020 align:middle line:90%
What's behind it?

01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:03.820 align:middle line:90%
The next room.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.850 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:09.550 align:middle line:84%
When you put an endoscope,
you cannot make gigantic,

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:10.600 align:middle line:90%
big pictures.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
You make hundreds of small
pictures, and in the computer

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:15.930 align:middle line:84%
you put these small pictures
together to a big picture,

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:19.130 align:middle line:84%
and that was behind
it, the next room.

01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
So it continues.

01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.250 align:middle line:84%
First room, second room,
third room, all behind it.

01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You cannot-- we know exactly
the geographical location.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:30.470 align:middle line:90%
We know exactly where it is.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
So the skeptics will ask,
why don't we go in there

01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.220 align:middle line:90%
and open it?

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Because you cannot.

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The shaft is 62 meters
high, but the shaft

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
has only a wide
of 14 centimeters.

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:45.890 align:middle line:90%
You cannot climb in there.

01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:48.630 align:middle line:90%
You need high tech to do so.

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
High tech is very expensive.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And you need the permission from
the Department of Archeology

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and Antiquity in Egypt,
and they'll never

01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:57.513 align:middle line:90%
give you the permission.

01:13:57.513 --> 01:14:01.380 align:middle line:90%


01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:03.360 align:middle line:90%
So this continues.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.340 align:middle line:84%
We know under the Great
Pyramid is another room.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.360 align:middle line:90%
It's called the unfinished room.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.640 align:middle line:84%
The tourists normally--
I guess you have all

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.100 align:middle line:84%
been in the pyramid,
You go in the pyramid,

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.900 align:middle line:84%
you can climb up
the great galley,

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
but you can never climb down.

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
In the rock under the
pyramid, yet again, a shaft.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.440 align:middle line:84%
This time, the
shaft is big enough

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:27.220 align:middle line:90%
you can climb down there.

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more
than 1 meter--

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:30.920 align:middle line:90%
not this one, just the next one.

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The shaft goes down into
the rock under the pyramid.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:39.590 align:middle line:90%
This shaft is 119 meters long.

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, 190 meters going
diagonally down there.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you come to a room
in the rock under the pyramid.

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.630 align:middle line:90%
190 meters diagonal.

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
If you look directly,
you are 38 meters

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:58.160 align:middle line:90%
in the rock under the pyramid.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a room, it's
called the unfinished room.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.870 align:middle line:90%
It makes absolutely no sense.

01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:14.280 align:middle line:84%
823 BC, now after Christ, the
pyramid was for the first time

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.290 align:middle line:90%
opened by Al-Ma'mun.

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
He was the ruler of
Egypt at that time.

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.590 align:middle line:90%
He also found this room.

01:15:20.590 --> 01:15:21.630 align:middle line:90%
He was down there.

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And he writes in his
biography that down there, he

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.600 align:middle line:90%
found three other rooms.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.710 align:middle line:84%
In one room, he found
sarcophagus with strange beings

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
which had elongated
head, strange weapons

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
which he could not understand,
and strange objects

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
in their hand.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.900 align:middle line:90%
And he was afraid--

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
he was afraid about
the power of the god.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.060 align:middle line:84%
He gave order to
change everything

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
down here that no one after him
could rediscover these rooms.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.980 align:middle line:90%
I was down there many times.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
I always had a hammer with me.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
You knocked at the wall and
sometimes it sounds hollow.

01:15:57.390 --> 01:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
But you can do nothing,
you cannot continue.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
Something has changed the
whole-- somebody has changed

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:05.250 align:middle line:90%
the whole situation down there.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And now came a society
with Herodotus, who says,

01:16:07.770 --> 01:16:10.350 align:middle line:84%
there is a lake
under the pyramid,

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:12.150 align:middle line:90%
a lake with clear water.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And the clear water
covers the sarcophagus.

01:16:14.370 --> 01:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, archeology never took
Herodotus's word serious.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.340 align:middle line:90%
He's dreaming.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:23.560 align:middle line:84%
He speaks about 11,340 years,
he speaks about the lake

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.360 align:middle line:90%
under the pyramid.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.110 align:middle line:90%
There can be no lake.

01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:26.910 align:middle line:90%
There is a lake.

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
We were down-- [? Ramone ?]
here, my wonderful young man

01:16:30.210 --> 01:16:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and I were down there.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.313 align:middle line:84%
The entry site of
the Great Pyramid.

01:16:35.313 --> 01:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
You come first to
this small room.

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:42.814 align:middle line:90%


01:16:42.814 --> 01:16:46.210 align:middle line:90%
You go down a staircase.

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:51.940 align:middle line:84%
From this point, there is a
shaft directly in the rock.

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, this shaft
is so large that it

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.600 align:middle line:90%
has room for two levels.

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.220 align:middle line:90%
You see two levels here.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Then you come to a room which
is in the rock of the pyramids.

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.150 align:middle line:90%


01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:05.620 align:middle line:90%
That room.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Here, seven niches are
cut out of the rock,

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but only in two niches
are some sarcophaguses.

01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:18.270 align:middle line:84%
This one is black basalt,
the next one is granite,

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:20.030 align:middle line:90%
the other ones are empty.

01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Chiseled completely, perfectly
chiseled out of the rock.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:27.020 align:middle line:84%
From this point,
you go deeper again.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Now you just show a shaft
which had room for two levels.

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The continuation in this
one is not the same shaft.

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You will see, there's
only room for one level.

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Now you are under the pyramid--

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.130 align:middle line:90%
deep under the pyramid.

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And then there's, in the
right angle, a crossing.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.020 align:middle line:84%
You have to go
down on your knees.

01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:49.260 align:middle line:84%
A few steps and you
are under the pyramid,

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and there is a lake,
exactly as Herodotus told us

01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:57.040 align:middle line:90%
with perfectly clear water.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And inside the lake
is a sarcophagus,

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
exactly as Herodotus has written
2 and 1/2 thousand years ago.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.260 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
you see nothing.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
You need your eyes.

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
We could not use
flashlights here.

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.800 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we would
use flashlight,

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
we simply have a
reflection like a mirror,

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:15.850 align:middle line:90%
and we have no pictures.

01:18:15.850 --> 01:18:17.470 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Now you see the sarcophagus
here in the water, covered up

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.790 align:middle line:90%
by clear water.

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
They told me the sarcophagus
was empty when they found it.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.995 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if this is true,
but that's what they told me.

01:18:30.995 --> 01:18:34.880 align:middle line:90%


01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.480 align:middle line:90%
And there's the water.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Department
of Antiquity in Egypt,

01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
they wanted, of course,
to know where does

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.580 align:middle line:90%
this sarcophagus come from.

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the shafts are
smaller than the sarcophagus,

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
they could not
transport it down there.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
You remember the one
shaft just with one level.

This is bigger.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.750 align:middle line:90%
So there must be other entries.

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:58.350 align:middle line:84%
So they were pushing
out the water.

01:18:58.350 --> 01:19:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And here you see
the same sarcophagus

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
without the water this time.

I told you, I love skeptics.

01:19:45.810 --> 01:19:48.810 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society, the
scientific community always

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:52.830 align:middle line:84%
want to be reasonable and they
are afraid to be ridiculed.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why they
never touch something

01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.070 align:middle line:90%
like UFOs or extraterrestrials.

01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:58.220 align:middle line:90%
No, no, [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
In reality, they
don't know much.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I am accused, and all of
my thinkers are accused--

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
we say that
extraterrestrials were there

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and we say that these
extraterrestrials visited us

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.880 align:middle line:90%
from far away.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.500 align:middle line:90%
This is absolutely impossible.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Every child knows the
distance in the universe

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.515 align:middle line:90%
are measured by--

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:20.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Light years.

01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:21.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Light years.

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
So you cannot cross
these light years.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.590 align:middle line:84%
The next star is roughly
four light years away,

01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and it could be 10 or
20 light years away.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So we have no possibility
to see each other.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Even if extraterrestrials do
exist, we never came together.

01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
That's what the skeptics say.

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:39.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's all not correct, again.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.010 align:middle line:90%


01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your American
space shuttle--

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.900 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.200 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] space shuttle.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
With every shot up
there, you can transport

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:52.330 align:middle line:90%
a heavy load of 30 tons.

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's just a
question of money,

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.380 align:middle line:90%
how much money to invest.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have three space
shuttles-- for the moment,

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.590 align:middle line:90%
you have none.

01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
You work together
with the Russians.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.190 align:middle line:84%
If you have three
or if you have 30--

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:05.200 align:middle line:84%
if you have 30 space
shuttles, then you

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:09.010 align:middle line:84%
would start every week, not
every few months, every week.

01:21:09.010 --> 01:21:12.970 align:middle line:10%
And every week, you would
transport 30 tons of heavy load

01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:15.880 align:middle line:10%
into the orbit between
Earth and the moon.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.780 align:middle line:10%
These heavy loads are
prefabricated blocks.

01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:23.470 align:middle line:10%
You cut them altogether
to a gigantic spaceship.

01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:28.020 align:middle line:10%
The spaceship has
the form of a ring.

01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:31.180 align:middle line:10%
This is a must, because when
you have the form of a ring,

01:21:31.180 --> 01:21:32.860 align:middle line:10%
you turn the space ship.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.100 align:middle line:10%
And by turning
around its own axis,

01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:39.600 align:middle line:10%
you create an artificial gravity
inside by centrifugal force.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:42.430 align:middle line:10%
So you always have
ground under your feet,

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:43.740 align:middle line:10%
you are not weightless.

01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to put
a propellant in there,

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and slowly, this
spaceship starts to move--

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
slowly.

01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:54.240 align:middle line:10%
If it only would reach 2%
of the speed of light--

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.010 align:middle line:10%
I am not speaking
of over the speed

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:57.870 align:middle line:10%
of light, all this scientific--

01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:00.120 align:middle line:10%
just 2% of the
speed of light, you

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.270 align:middle line:10%
would reach a distance
of 10 light years

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:05.672 align:middle line:10%
within 500 human years.

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:07.380 align:middle line:10%
Now, they say, come
on, 500 human years--

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.110 align:middle line:10%
no one of us will
become 500 human years.

01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:11.650 align:middle line:10%
It's not necessary.

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:13.520 align:middle line:10%
This is a generation spaceship.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:17.680 align:middle line:10%
On board, you make love, you
make children, grandchildren,

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.480 align:middle line:10%
and on.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So after 500 years,
you have reached

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:23.580 align:middle line:90%
the distance of 10 light years.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely
possible to move

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.540 align:middle line:84%
in the stars--
between the stars,

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:32.310 align:middle line:84%
between one star and the other,
even with primitive technology.

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Not with light speed or
nearly coming to light speed.

01:22:35.970 --> 01:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it is possible.

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The critics, the skeptics
never mention this possibility,

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:41.880 align:middle line:90%
generation spaceship.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
Then the next
accusation is always,

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
even if extraterrestrials
do exist

01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.018 align:middle line:84%
and even if they could reach us,
they would never look like we--

01:22:50.018 --> 01:22:51.435 align:middle line:84%
they would never
look like humans.

01:22:51.435 --> 01:22:54.090 align:middle line:84%
They would maybe look like
elephants or flying tentacles

01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:55.950 align:middle line:90%
over there, but never like us.

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:59.010 align:middle line:84%
This is wrong again, and this
is a theory, which I'll shortly

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:01.240 align:middle line:90%
expand, panspermia.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Panspermia was
brought into the world

01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
by the Swedish Nobel Prize
winner, Mr. Arrhenius.

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.870 align:middle line:90%
That was 90 years ago.

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:13.300 align:middle line:84%
The following idea
is panspermia.

01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:16.130 align:middle line:84%
You go out with a
spaceship, as I explained.

01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:18.430 align:middle line:90%
You create a new society.

01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And now the first
society has an interest

01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
to spread out themself, as
we have plans at the moment.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.380 align:middle line:90%
We want to go to Mars.

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.110 align:middle line:84%
And from Mars, we go to the
next solar system, and so on.

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%
Spread out yourself.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Spread out yourself
means, humans

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:34.420 align:middle line:90%
are spreading out themselves.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:36.910 align:middle line:90%
You can do it also by spermia.

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.860 align:middle line:90%
This is why panspermia--

01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
you infect a section
of your Milky Way

01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:46.990 align:middle line:84%
with your own informations
of life, and it will work

01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and you'll create
on planets which

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
are similar to the planet
Earth a new evolution of form

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:52.840 align:middle line:90%
of life.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.640 align:middle line:90%
This is panspermia.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.060 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.410 align:middle line:90%
It works.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite possible that
extraterrestrials look like us

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.370 align:middle line:90%
or look similar to us.

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
All the arguments,
this is not possible,

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.840 align:middle line:90%
they are not looking like us.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.350 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
reach the distance

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and it is possible
that they look like us.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.410 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:19.460 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, my time
is over and I have to stop.

01:24:19.460 --> 01:24:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I want to remember you.

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Take your time and look
at this crowd funding

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.710 align:middle line:84%
because that's something
which I have in my soul.

01:24:28.710 --> 01:24:32.510 align:middle line:84%
I want to have scientific
results concerning Nazca.

01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to shock the world
again with scientific, clear

01:24:36.230 --> 01:24:39.170 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] and say, I'm
sorry, what are you telling us?

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have the scientific
results brought together

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.160 align:middle line:90%
by five different universities.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We can do it and we
will bring it to public.

01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:49.130 align:middle line:84%
Ladies and gentlemen, you
were listening to me--

01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:52.600 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
