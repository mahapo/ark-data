00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Without further ado, let
me bring to you my friend,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Darryl Anka.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.132 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:16.024 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.270 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Listen, thank you all so
much for coming tonight.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:90%
We really deeply appreciate it.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:84%
It's been quite a few years
since we've done an expo.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
We're happy to be back here
at The Conscious Life Expo.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And we really, really
appreciate your involvement,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:90%
your interaction.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So please have a
good time tonight.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I will take a short
nap and see you later.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.142 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.142 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I wanna say good day to
you this day of your time.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.840 align:middle line:90%
How are y'all?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, we thank
each and every one of you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
once again for the co-creation
of this interaction.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It is always our
passion and our pleasure

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to interact with each
and every and all of you.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
This transmission has been
titled The Past, The Present,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:90%
and The Future are Within You.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And we will get to
that in a moment.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But let us give a brief recap
about the concept of time.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, you
have now for many years

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
been talking about the idea
that time is an illusion.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.840 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.680 align:middle line:84%
In that sense, it isn't
quote unquote real.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.352 align:middle line:90%
But it is real as an experience.

00:02:50.352 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And you create it with
your consciousness

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific way.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
As many of you are
beginning to realize,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
there are an infinite
number of probable realities

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that in a sense overlap all at
once, simultaneously coexisting

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
with what you consider
your reality to be.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that time
is a side effect created

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.920 align:middle line:84%
by shifting the focus
of your consciousness

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
through different parallel
reality frameworks literally

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.470 align:middle line:90%
billions of times per second.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
It's like your movie projector
is your consciousness focusing

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
through different frames
on a so-called film

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:90%
strip of reality.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you illuminate frame
by frame by frame by frame,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
you create this illusion, this
projection of time and space

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:90%
and movement and change.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Each and every frame has no
movement in and of itself,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:90%
no experience in and of itself.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So you have to create the
idea of continuity one frame

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
after another in
linear terms to create

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
this idea, this projection, this
holographic structure you call

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:90%
physical reality space time.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Now the idea of creating
this is to give you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.470 align:middle line:84%
a particular
experience that allows

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:84%
you to forget that you
are a greater being

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
and then go through a process
of remembering that you are

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
a greater being but from a new
point of view, a new discovery,

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:90%
a new perspective of yourself.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:84%
This is how creation
expands because you

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
see the structure of
existence never changes.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:84%
What changes, what
expands creation,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
is your relationship to, your
reflection of, your perspective

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.237 align:middle line:84%
of, and your experience of that
structure that never changes.

00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:45.070 align:middle line:84%
So by creating these
different perspectives,

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
these different points of
view of the same structure,

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
you continue to expand
creation and all that is

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
can experience itself
in all the ways

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
that it's possible
to experience itself

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:84%
through each and every one
of your unique viewpoints

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
being reflections
of all that is.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
But the idea now is
that for many millennia,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
you have been dealing
with this concept of time

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.870 align:middle line:90%
in certain ways.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But now it's time
to start dealing

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:90%
with time in a different way.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost, by even
knowing and understanding

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that it is your
projection, that it

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
is a side effect of your
consciousness shifting

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
these billions of
times per second,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
the product of knowing that,
the product of becoming aware

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
that you're already
shifting that quickly,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
is what creates this sensation
you call acceleration.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It's not that you
actually accelerate

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.670 align:middle line:84%
or shift any faster than you
have always been shifting.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It's that by becoming more
aware of the rate of shift,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
you experience it
as a reflection

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in your physical reality
more and more and more.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And it appears as if
your reality is actually

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
accelerating.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
This expands your senses so that
you can see more, feel more, be

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in touch with more things, from
a broader perspective, a higher

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:90%
point of view.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to
experience physical reality

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
as more flexible,
more malleable,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.680 align:middle line:84%
more plastic, where you
can experience things

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:84%
like synchronicity more
often and other kinds of side

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:84%
effects of space
and time that allow

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.260 align:middle line:84%
you to know that it
is your projection,

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:90%
that it is your creation.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to have more
conscious awareness of how

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to use it artistically
to your advantage.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The idea now as
we titled this is

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that you have for
a long time been

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
anchored to this concept of
the past creating your present.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And as we have said many times,
this is not actually true.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.190 align:middle line:84%
It may be a description
of the kind of experience

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:90%
you're having.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But there's a big difference
between a description

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
of an experience from your
spacetime point of view

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.610 align:middle line:84%
and a description of the
actual mechanism underlying

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:90%
the experience--

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.360 align:middle line:84%
two very different
things very often.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.280 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that you
experience in space time

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
is that your past
generates your present.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:84%
In truth, your present
generates your past

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.180 align:middle line:90%
because there is only now.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.740 align:middle line:90%
There is only here.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
This is the only
place you exist.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the only place
you create from.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, when you define
who and what you are in this

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.520 align:middle line:84%
present experience of yourself
by changing yourself literally

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
into a different
person every moment--

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and I mean this literally,
it's not a metaphor--

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:84%
every moment, any change,
total and complete change,

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.840 align:middle line:84%
you are a different
person literally

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
on a different version
of earth literally

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
in a different
multiverse literally.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, every single
time you change yourself

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
by whatever amount or
degree, in whatever way,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.520 align:middle line:90%
you are truly a new person.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So in working through the idea
of the framework of spacetime

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to make it make sense
logically as you say,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:84%
you have to have linearly
speaking a new past that

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
determines how you became
the person you are now

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.705 align:middle line:90%
in the present that's different.

00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
So every single time you
become a different person,

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
that different person
has a new past.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now the idea may
not seem to be that.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
You may go, well, I
remember being this,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and I remember
being that, and that

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:90%
doesn't seem to have changed.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.130 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
you don't actually

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:84%
know whether it's
changed or not.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when you become a new
person and create a new past,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.539 align:middle line:84%
it's going to seem from
your present perspective

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.850 align:middle line:84%
that you always had
that past because that's

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
the only past that makes sense
for the person you are now.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
how many pasts you

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
may have had in this life
you call a single lifetime.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
The idea is is that your history
is constantly, dynamically

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:90%
changing.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.275 align:middle line:84%
When you understand
that's how it works,

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
when you understand that
that's a description

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
of the actual underlying
mechanism at work,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
then regardless of what the
experience appears to be,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.920 align:middle line:84%
you will start to realize
that you are changing

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:84%
your past every moment
that you change yourself

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:90%
by any degree of definition.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And that means you are free
truly to experience whatever

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.960 align:middle line:84%
you prefer to experience
unlocking yourself from

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:84%
the idea of anything in
the past that controls you

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:84%
in the present,
which it doesn't.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
You simply create the
illusion of continuity

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that in the present
recreates the idea

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.930 align:middle line:90%
of the so-called memory.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But the memory is
not of the past.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You're recreating that
memory in the present

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.540 align:middle line:84%
as part of the definition
of your present self.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you break
continuity and stop

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
defining yourself
that way, you actually

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
will experience the
results of having

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.678 align:middle line:84%
a different past
because it will show you

00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
that you have a completely
different present that

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.390 align:middle line:84%
has nothing at all to do
with what the past used

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:84%
to be for whoever
that other person was

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.287 align:middle line:90%
that is no longer you.

00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We understand that sometimes,
these higher dimensional

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
concepts can seem a
little bit challenging,

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:90%
a little bit confusing.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.193 align:middle line:90%
You'll get used to it.

00:10:21.193 --> 00:10:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that
you are beginning

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.320 align:middle line:90%
to think multidimensionally.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we share
multidimensional perspectives

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
with you because it
stretches your ability

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
to really experience yourself as
a multidimensional being, which

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.750 align:middle line:90%
is what you are.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Please remember that
the idea is your greater

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:90%
self is your natural state.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:84%
You are not really
naturally physical people.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
You are greater
non-physical entities,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:90%
non-physical consciousness.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
You never really
actually leave what

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
we'll call the spirit realm.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:90%
You have never left it.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You are there right now
dreaming that you're not.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what physical
reality is, a dream

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
you are having in spirit that
you're no longer in spirit.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
So when you wake up
from the physical dream,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
you go, oh, that
was just a dream.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:90%
This is who I really am.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Much in the same way when
you are physical and wake up

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
from a dream, no matter
how real the dream

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:84%
seemed in your sleep time,
you wake up and go, oh,

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.848 align:middle line:90%
that was just a dream.

00:11:27.848 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Very real dream, but
that was just a dream.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:90%
And this is who I really am.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
The same thing will happen when
you transition into spirit.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that was just a dream.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:90%
This is who I really am.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
But I can learn from that dream.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.098 align:middle line:84%
What is that I went
there to learn?

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:84%
What is it I dreamt
I needed to know?

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:90%
That's what you will do.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:84%
But continuing on with the idea
of how you use space and time

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.940 align:middle line:84%
in a new way in this
new understanding

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
is that as we have
said for a long time,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
you anchored yourself into
this concept of the past.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:84%
But now as you transition,
and you start living more

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:84%
in the present, you
begin to realize

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:84%
that you are free to choose
where the so-called influence

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.870 align:middle line:90%
actually comes from.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want to create
this concept of continuity

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.910 align:middle line:84%
and being influenced
by something,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
you can switch the idea
of being influenced

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
from your so-called
past to starting

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:84%
to be influenced from your
so-called future self.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Because even in this life,
you have future selves

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:90%
every moment.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, you are here.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, you are here.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, you are here.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But this here was the future
of that first now you are here.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
every moment as you're

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
shifting again billions
of times per second,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.340 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to shift
your focus forward,

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, still
living in the present

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.030 align:middle line:84%
but understanding that you're
now drawing information,

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
energy, and experience
not so much from the past

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:84%
anymore unless it
serves you to do

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
so but now from
the future you who

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is urging you and
encouraging you forward

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and forward and forward
into your higher self,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.660 align:middle line:90%
into the self you prefer to be.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And as this switch occurs
and as this focus shifts,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
you will begin to feel more
communication from the higher

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
mind, more synchronicity
in your life,

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
because you know that
the future you or what

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:84%
you deem to be the future
you is living that way.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And so as that becomes
more real for you, as you

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:84%
in the future become
more real to you

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.375 align:middle line:84%
in the present in the
same way that the you

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:29.890 align:middle line:84%
in the so-called past
has been real for you

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.490 align:middle line:84%
for so long, as you shift
that focus to the future you,

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes more real,
you will gain more insight.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.760 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to be and
mirror that version of you

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
more and more easily, more
and more effortlessly.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And you will start living the
life in the present of what

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.617 align:middle line:90%
you deem the future to be.

00:13:47.617 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So you are shifting
your focus now.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Because again as we say, this
so-called past and the present

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
and the future all
exist within you.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.290 align:middle line:90%
There is no out there there.

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
It is a reflection just like
a mirror in your reality.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.670 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking in a mirror,
and you see your reflection

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.150 align:middle line:84%
frowning, you don't
go over to the mirror

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and shout at it to
change the reflection.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:84%
The only way the mirror
will be able to smile at you

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.350 align:middle line:90%
is if you smile first.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
If you are waiting
for the outer reality

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
to change to make a
difference in your life,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
you will wait forever.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But when you decide
to change, no matter

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
what's going on around
you in the reflection,

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that is proof of true
change because you're not

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
making your change
conditional on what's going on

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:90%
in the outer reflection.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.000 align:middle line:84%
You are saying, that
doesn't really matter to me.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that
I can allow anything

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to serve me in a
positive way, I am not

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.570 align:middle line:84%
basing my state of being on
the old-fashioned, outdated

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
meanings that others
have given to what's

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
going on in this reality.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I get to decide what this means.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I get to decide what
the definitions are

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that work for me because
I am my own reality.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I am my own unique
point of view,

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.980 align:middle line:90%
and I get to say what goes.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is for you to start
relaxing the old definitions

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and realize at any given
moment what definitions

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
you are applying to things
that don't work for you

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and start applying
definitions that do.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Because as you have
experienced, existence

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to support you
no matter what you choose.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
contradict you.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It can't again in the same
way that the mirror can't

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
contradict you for whatever
your facial expression is.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
It has to give you back what
it is you're giving off.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.810 align:middle line:84%
That's simply the
way it's structured.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So if it has supported
you when you're frowning

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and given you negative
synchronicity,

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.640 align:middle line:84%
why wouldn't it support you
when you decide to smile

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and get positive synchronicity?

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.000 align:middle line:90%
It will not contradict you.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
It absolutely will
not because it's

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:84%
waiting for you to
determine who you are,

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
what state of being you prefer
so it can reflect that to you.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't care what you choose
because it's unconditionally

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:90%
supportive.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.660 align:middle line:90%
That's what unconditional means.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
You are so unconditionally
supported in fact,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
you are even allowed to
believe that you are not

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:90%
unconditionally supported.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.970 align:middle line:84%
That's how unconditionally
supported you are.

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you can believe that
you are not unconditionally

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.383 align:middle line:84%
supported, you're not
going to be contradicted

00:16:31.383 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
believe that you

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.780 align:middle line:90%
are supported unconditionally.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you
have the control.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself
to take the time

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to explore the idea
of connecting more

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to your own future self
in this life knowing

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
that your future self is already
experiencing simultaneously

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things that
you prefer to experience

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.060 align:middle line:84%
in your life now in the present
so that you can act more

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
like that version of
you and become more

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
like that version of you in the
new presents that keep coming

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.900 align:middle line:84%
as you flow your projector
light through the present frame,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.089 align:middle line:84%
present frame, present
frame, present frame.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And by acting on your passion
and staying in your center

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
and staying in
the positive state

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:84%
and extracting the benefit
from whatever is happening,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.373 align:middle line:84%
then you navigate yourself
through all the frames

00:17:22.373 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that are more and
more and more and more

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
indicative and reflective
of that reality

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:84%
you say you prefer to experience
because you're the one creating

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:90%
that within yourself.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It's not coming from outside.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from within you.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.670 align:middle line:84%
One final very important
thing is that to remember it

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.880 align:middle line:90%
doesn't matter what happens.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It matters what you
do with what happens.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes the
difference in your reality.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.820 align:middle line:84%
It makes all the
difference in the world.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for allowing
us to share this idea.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Let it sink in
its own good time.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Make it your own.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.340 align:middle line:90%
Use it how you will.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
And have fun with it.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the first step toward
enlightenment is to lighten up.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Don't take things so seriously.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Have some fun.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a process.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.300 align:middle line:90%
Life is a process.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
But it can be an energizing,
exciting, ecstatic,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
synchronistic one if
you allow it to be.

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Each and every one
of you has a current

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.350 align:middle line:84%
in the ocean of creation
that is unique to you.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:43.140 align:middle line:84%
Going with the flow
means you allow

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.350 align:middle line:84%
yourself to know that
the current knows

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.840 align:middle line:90%
where you need to go.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Go with that flow.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Don't resist.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Don't swim upstream unless
of course you enjoy pain.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to know
that surrender is not

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:90%
surrendering control.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Surrender is surrendering to the
control that's already innately

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:90%
built in to you.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Allow it to express itself
through synchronicity,

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
through imagination,
through being here and now,

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:90%
which is all there is.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
In return for the gift that you
are allowing our civilization

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.350 align:middle line:84%
to experience in each
and every one of you,

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I ask you now in what way
may we be of service to you.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Please begin with your questions
and dialogue if you wish.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.109 align:middle line:90%
>> So are you ready?

00:19:39.109 --> 00:19:39.909 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:40.709 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey Bashar,
how are you doing?

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:90%
I am perfect.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I am pretty good.

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Just pretty good?

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I am fantastic.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.010 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Bashar?

00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a member of the media.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm a talking head.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you have more
of a body than that.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think I can speak for
everybody in this room--

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.483 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe, maybe not.

00:20:10.483 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> --that lately we think we're
in another reality when it

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.110 align:middle line:84%
comes to the media
and fake news.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.350 align:middle line:84%
What advice can you
give all of this today

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to either learn to
trust the media again,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.060 align:middle line:84%
or is there another
way we should all

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
be getting our
information and thinking?

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not about shoulds.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:90%
It's about what you prefer.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's not even about
trusting the media.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's about trusting yourselves.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea of what's
going on is this.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:84%
You are now literally
beginning to experience

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
the physical effects
of your world splitting

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:53.950 align:middle line:84%
into multiple parallel reality
versions of earth, literally

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.780 align:middle line:90%
physically.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:84%
The idea is you're going
to see a lot more shakeups

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.710 align:middle line:84%
and breakups because you are
disassembling the idea that you

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:84%
live in one reality and
beginning to understand that

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
no matter that you can still
see a reality you don't prefer,

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
you're living in it.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.980 align:middle line:84%
There are now what
might euphemistically

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
be referred to as
glass walls beginning

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to appear between the
different reality vibrations.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So even though you may still
be able to see a reality

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:84%
you don't prefer
and people making

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.220 align:middle line:84%
choices you don't prefer,
just because you can see them

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that
what they're doing

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.850 align:middle line:84%
can reach you through
that glass wall.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:90%
These walls are filters now.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
They are beginning to
exist as thickening energy.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And less and less
and less will you

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.670 align:middle line:84%
be able to receive or experience
the effects of someone else's

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:84%
reality that is
not vibrationally

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.930 align:middle line:84%
compatible with the
reality you prefer.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.088 align:middle line:84%
But you by living the
reality you prefer,

00:21:51.088 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
because the others on the
other side of the glass walls

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
can still see you
too, allows you

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to become a living example
of other kinds of choices

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that they can also make
should they decide to do so.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you live in your
passion, act on your passion

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to the best you can
with no insistence,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.010 align:middle line:84%
no assumption as to what
that outcome is supposed

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.710 align:middle line:84%
to look like, you steer
yourself more and more

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%
strongly in the
direction of the reality

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.870 align:middle line:84%
you prefer, the version of
earth that you're shifting to.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Because remember, you never
change the earths you're on.

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.780 align:middle line:90%
You change yourself.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And in increments, you
shift to other versions

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.040 align:middle line:84%
of coexisting earths that
are simply more and more

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
reflective of the changes
you're making within you.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You're actually not on
the same planet with them

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
anymore even if you
can still see them.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't be fooled by that.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:84%
In time, you will find that as
this becomes more crystallized

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and as the separations
become stronger,

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you will no longer
in the years to come

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.720 align:middle line:84%
see those that are
not vibrationally

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:90%
compatible with what you prefer.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you will think,
oh, the earth has changed.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.893 align:middle line:90%
No, you have.

00:23:02.893 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And you've shifted yourself to a
version of earth that is simply

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
more reflective of what you
prefer to experience while they

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
may still be experiencing their
version of earth that is not

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:84%
vibrationally
compatible with yours.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.427 align:middle line:84%
All the earths exist
simultaneously.

00:23:16.427 --> 00:23:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And now you're
beginning to experience

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea of shifting more
and more to the one that

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
is more reflective of
who you prefer to be.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's about trusting yourself
not even trusting the media.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Just listen to what is being
said and decide for yourselves,

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.340 align:middle line:90%
this makes sense.

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:90%
This aligns for me.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:90%
This does not make sense.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:90%
This does not align for me.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.840 align:middle line:90%
It's your choice.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And that choice will
steer you in the direction

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
of the version of earth that
is more reflective of who you

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.788 align:middle line:90%
prefer to be.

00:23:45.788 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Bashar.

00:23:47.955 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.160 align:middle line:90%
I feel better.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I feel better.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:90%
One more question if I may?

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a question.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So I suppose you
can ask another.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, two questions,
two questions.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Is 2019 going to be the
year of disclosure please?

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Not in the way you mean it.

00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The way is still within the
general window of 2025 to 2033

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
or 40 in terms of the
way you mean that.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But disclosure is happening
more and more all the time.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that there will
be opportunities and incidents

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that will allow for the
acceleration of what

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:90%
you're calling disclosure.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And that will
certainly continue.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And there may be a
few larger incidents

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that will bring it to the
attention of more people.

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of
what you're asking,

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:90%
you still have a few years left.

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's all right.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Because in that process,
more and more people

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
will shift to the reality
that is more vibrationally

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.540 align:middle line:84%
compatible with the
idea of open contact.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I will say thank you for
everybody in this room.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You are welcome.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.108 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Is there another questioner?

00:25:16.004 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.843 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:25:25.843 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually wasn't
going to come here today.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:90%
But my friend brought me.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
you're on this topic.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.470 align:middle line:90%
I had a dream this morning.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.970 align:middle line:90%
And it was--

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
it's a book-- but it

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%
was conversations with my past.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And it was very clear to me.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:41.102 align:middle line:84%
I woke up, I didn't
know what that meant.

00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:43.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's kind of
what we're talking about.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.603 align:middle line:84%
You are beginning to form
connections to the idea

00:25:45.603 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
that what you call the past,
present, and future all

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
exist simultaneously, coexist
within your consciousness.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can have conversations
with any other aspect

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.833 align:middle line:90%
of yourself whatsoever.

00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
This in a sense
is actually what's

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
happening right now
in front of you.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Because linearly
speaking, if you

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.970 align:middle line:84%
want to look at
it this way, I am

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.640 align:middle line:84%
what you would call the
channel's future incarnation.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And he is one of my
past incarnations.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.760 align:middle line:84%
So I am speaking
through my past self.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.730 align:middle line:84%
When you understand the
flexibility and plasticity

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of time and space, you can
do these kinds of things.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So as you expand
your consciousness,

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.330 align:middle line:84%
you will realize that it's all
here, all right here and right

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.130 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can communicate
with any aspect

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of your total consciousness
that you wish to.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're dropping
those barriers.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:90%
See, here's the paradox.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
What we just described
as the splitting

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
into parallel realities and
the thickening of glass walls

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:84%
in between them actually
paradoxically on the other side

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.570 align:middle line:84%
means that the walls
that you have created

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.550 align:middle line:84%
within your
consciousness for so long

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.500 align:middle line:84%
are actually getting thinner,
and thinner, and thinner,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and thinner until they
become almost nonexistent.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So you can start breaking
through those previous barriers

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and communicate up and down the
timelines in other dimensions

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%
so on and so forth.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:90%
Par for the course.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It does completely.

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:90%
Should I start writing?

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> There are no shoulds.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Are you passionate
about writing?

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Not really.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] I'm not.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Now one moment.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:84%
This is an important
moment, important moment.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when we talk about the
idea of acting on your passion,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
and you say, well, something
isn't really my passion,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:84%
or even something is my passion,
it is, in a sense, actually

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.300 align:middle line:84%
always your duty to yourself
to determine something

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.920 align:middle line:90%
very important at that moment.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Is it something that is not
really, truly my excitement,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
not really, truly
aligned with my truth?

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Or am I holding
onto beliefs that

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
make it appear not to
be when it could be?

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, is something
I'm saying is exciting

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.100 align:middle line:90%
really my excitement?

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Or are my beliefs
disguising my anxiety

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
as excitement so
that I can do that

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:90%
instead of my true excitement?

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:90%
Know thyself.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
Be authentic and
transparent within yourself.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And always determine first
whether your beliefs are

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.820 align:middle line:84%
changing the vibration
you're experiencing

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
or whether it is an
accurate reflection

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that you are
experiencing by being

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:90%
authentic and transparent.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that if something
truly is not your excitement,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.077 align:middle line:90%
find out what is.

00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And remember, when we talk
about acting on your passion,

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
we don't mean that it has
to be a life-spanning career

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.418 align:middle line:90%
or a gigantic project.

00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't mean it has
to come with trumpets.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Doot doo doo!

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:90%
The idea is that you can begin.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.380 align:middle line:84%
If you don't find
something immediately,

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:48.530 align:middle line:90%
you can always begin simply.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.930 align:middle line:84%
At any given moment,
you all have a number

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.860 align:middle line:90%
of options available to you.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.660 align:middle line:90%
I can take a walk.

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I can read a book.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
I can call a friend.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:55.970 align:middle line:90%
I can see a movie.

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:90%
I can eat a meal.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Just always pick the
one that has even just

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:84%
the slightest more attraction
or excitement in it

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.150 align:middle line:84%
than any other option
and do that first.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And then keep doing it when
you run out of that one.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.255 align:middle line:84%
Just keep choosing the
next one that has even

00:29:13.255 --> 00:29:14.630 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit
more excitement

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
than any other option
and do that next.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what's known
as the organizing

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:90%
principle of synchronicity.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:84%
It will always bring you
down the correct aligned path

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:84%
if you keep acting on what it
brings you that contains more

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.750 align:middle line:90%
excitement than anything else.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Because excitement,
passion, creativity, love,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
this is the energetic
language of your higher

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.100 align:middle line:90%
mind talking to you.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
So when you act on the
things that excite you,

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.640 align:middle line:84%
physically take action on
them to the best you can,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
no insistence on
the outcome, then

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.960 align:middle line:84%
you are responding fully
to the higher mind.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Because even though energy might
be the language of the higher

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:56.420 align:middle line:84%
mind, which you experience
in your body as passion,

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.390 align:middle line:84%
excitement, creativity,
love, the language

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.700 align:middle line:84%
of physical reality
is action, not

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.910 align:middle line:90%
words, not thoughts, action.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're not taking
action, you're

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.080 align:middle line:84%
not speaking the language
of physical reality.

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you cannot
get a physical reflection.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:90%
Now, very important.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, your excitement
will present itself to you

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.580 align:middle line:90%
in some particular form.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.040 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's important to
drop all insistence that it

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.370 align:middle line:84%
must continue to come to
fruition in that form.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, your
passion will come to you

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:84%
through synchronicity
and from your higher

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:84%
mind in a way that just gets
you excited enough to take

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:90%
an action.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:84%
It might only come that way just
to-- excuse the language-- get

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.220 align:middle line:84%
you off your butt
so that you then

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.240 align:middle line:90%
wind up where you need to be.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So that what really needs to
happen can happen more easily.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So never assume that the
form the excitement comes

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.500 align:middle line:84%
in actually in and of itself has
to come to fruition because you

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.260 align:middle line:84%
don't know where it's
actually taking you.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:00.820 align:middle line:90%
Just go with the flow.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:90%
See what happens.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:90%
It will show you.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.690 align:middle line:84%
And even if, even if,
you manifest something

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
you objectively don't prefer,
not a judgment value, just

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:84%
a recognition it's vibrationally
incompatible with what

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
you prefer, it still must
be there for a reason.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So if you stay in
a positive state,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.580 align:middle line:84%
you can use what you don't
prefer in a way that you do

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and extract a beneficial
outcome by staying

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.780 align:middle line:84%
in the positive
state realizing, this

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
has got to be here for
a reason that serves me.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.830 align:middle line:90%
It can't be any other way.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
That level of conviction,
that level of knowledge,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.060 align:middle line:84%
is what will propel you and
accelerate you through life.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this helping?

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.140 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:49.140 --> 00:32:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Bashar.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.520 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a question
about self-limitations.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Self-limitation.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Now before you continue,
please remember limitations

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.782 align:middle line:84%
by themselves are not
necessarily negative.

00:32:20.782 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.400 align:middle line:84%
You need limitations to have a
physical experience, don't you?

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.852 align:middle line:84%
So just remember,
limitations by themselves

00:32:30.852 --> 00:32:32.060 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily negative.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.590 align:middle line:84%
But you can recognize
that you may

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
impose certain negative
ones on yourself.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We assume those are the ones you
referring to about letting go.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:43.750 align:middle line:90%
Please continue.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And for my case
in particular,

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.660 align:middle line:84%
I have semi-debilitating
social anxiety.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.010 align:middle line:90%
I meditate.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.240 align:middle line:90%
I try to work on myself.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And but the moment I
go out into society,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of like I don't
want to feel that way.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.970 align:middle line:90%
It just-- I can't help but--

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:02.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel
that way right now?

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a little bit.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I want to
make sure what can I

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:84%
do to try to shift myself
into a timeline that--

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> You can answer this question.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.810 align:middle line:84%
As you move forward to
be yourself in the way

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
you say you prefer to by
interacting with society

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in any way you need
to to be yourself,

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
what are you afraid
might happen?

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you answer that
question honestly?

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.380 align:middle line:84%
What are you afraid
might happen?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:30.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess just being judged.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> By whom, someone that has
no business understanding

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.680 align:middle line:90%
your life?

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Fair enough.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things I try
to tell myself but it's--

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you can't
try to tell yourself.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
that's how it works.

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:48.910 align:middle line:84%
No one can know
you more than you.

00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is they
don't get to judge you

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:middle line:90%
even if they attempt to.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.290 align:middle line:90%
They can't judge you.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible for
them to actually judge you

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
because they have nothing
to do with the experience

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.380 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.600 align:middle line:90%
It's your life.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:90%
You are a unique reality.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Now even though they may
attempt to judge you,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.139 align:middle line:84%
you will understand that
if they are doing so,

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:84%
more often than not, it's
a projection onto you

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of issues within themselves
that they themselves

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.370 align:middle line:90%
are afraid to face.

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:22.066 align:middle line:84%
So they're the ones in
greater fear than you.

00:34:22.066 --> 00:34:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:90%
See them that way.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.739 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who judges you, you
can simply compassionately

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:31.710 align:middle line:84%
recognize is struggling
with a greater fear

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:84%
than you have or they wouldn't
project that judgment onto you

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:84%
because they're so afraid
of looking within for fear

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:84%
that they themselves
are unworthy.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:43.680 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think you can begin to
look at others that way if they

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.429 align:middle line:90%
judge you?

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:51.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I will try.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.389 align:middle line:90%
>> You keep saying you will try.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:90%
What is it again--

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.510 align:middle line:90%
let's go back to the question--

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.340 align:middle line:84%
what are you afraid will
happen if you actually do

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:90%
it instead of trying to do it?

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.340 align:middle line:84%
What's the actual
consequence that you fear?

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
What's the end result that you
fear of being yourself the way

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.800 align:middle line:84%
you wish to be in all situations
no matter where or with whom?

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:84%
What is the ultimate consequence
you fear might happen?

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We've gone beyond the idea of
being judged because now you

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:84%
can begin to understand
that that isn't real.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:90%
It's their issues, not yours.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
ultimate fear here?

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I guess being alone and--

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:39.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Being alone.

00:35:39.465 --> 00:35:41.936 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand you are alone?

00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:49.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And do you understand
that you're never alone?

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a little trick that
you can use in your language.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
Because all you have
to do is add an L

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.730 align:middle line:90%
and then alone becomes all one.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
The only time you feel the
negativity of being alone

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is when you get the L out.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:18.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.975 align:middle line:90%
We so love your language.

00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:23.880 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So put the L back
in and be all one.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Anytime you feel alone
in the negative sense,

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
put the L back and remember
that you are all one

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.783 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
never really alone.

00:36:35.783 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
But then there are
times when it's

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.940 align:middle line:90%
positive to be on your own.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.910 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine too.

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But you can never
really be disconnected.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain it this way.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.580 align:middle line:84%
If you could actually be
disconnected and cut off,

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.840 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't exist.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You can have an experience
of disconnection,

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:02.240 align:middle line:84%
an experience of being
alone in the negative sense.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're creating that
from your connection.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the paradox.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.610 align:middle line:84%
You can only experience
being disconnected

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
by using your
connection to everything

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:15.362 align:middle line:90%
to create that experience.

00:37:15.362 --> 00:37:18.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand the paradox?

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.040 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:20.020 align:middle line:90%
Maybe?

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, maybe.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Maybe.

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.560 align:middle line:90%
You can not be disconnected.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible to be
disconnected from creation.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.300 align:middle line:90%
You are a part of creation.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.828 align:middle line:84%
But you can create
the experience

00:37:31.828 --> 00:37:32.870 align:middle line:90%
that you're disconnected.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.105 align:middle line:84%
But you're using your connection
to create that experience.

00:37:36.105 --> 00:37:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you realize
you couldn't possibly

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.680 align:middle line:84%
create an experience
of disconnection

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.300 align:middle line:84%
unless you were
connected, you will

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.140 align:middle line:84%
erase the experience
of disconnection

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:46.673 align:middle line:90%
if you truly understand this.

00:37:46.673 --> 00:37:48.590 align:middle line:84%
But you can let it sink
in your own good time.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:90%
That's up to you.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.520 align:middle line:84%
But I guarantee
you you're worthy.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if you weren't
worthy of your existence,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.650 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't exist because
creation doesn't make mistakes.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We hear people on your planet
all the time, I'm not worthy.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't deserve.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm no good.

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, creation
doesn't make mistakes.

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:21.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to insist
on your lack of worthiness,

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:25.410 align:middle line:90%
you're arguing with creation.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.856 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you, you will
never win that argument.

00:38:28.856 --> 00:38:29.822 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:29.822 --> 00:38:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Never because you
cannot cease to exist.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.420 align:middle line:84%
You can change your
form all you want.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But the core of
you will always be

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.325 align:middle line:84%
you having the experience
of what you've changed to.

00:38:45.325 --> 00:38:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The you cannot be annihilated,
just can't be because you

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:52.238 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:38:52.238 --> 00:38:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Why can that which
exists never become

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.780 align:middle line:90%
that which doesn't exist?

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:03.580 align:middle line:84%
By definition, non-existence
doesn't exist literally.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.820 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.600 align:middle line:84%
The quality of non-existence
is to not exist.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.330 align:middle line:90%
That's its quality.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.800 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't exist.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So if it doesn't exist, how
can that which exists ever

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:16.640 align:middle line:90%
become nonexistent?

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.670 align:middle line:84%
There is no place for existence
to go because non-existence

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:22.535 align:middle line:90%
doesn't exist by definition.

00:39:22.535 --> 00:39:25.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] Let it sink in.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.792 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:32.792 --> 00:39:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Please understand
before we continue.

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:46.230 align:middle line:90%
These are not just sayings.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:50.370 align:middle line:84%
This is not a philosophy
we are sharing with you.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:54.510 align:middle line:84%
We are literally describing
the structure of existence

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.600 align:middle line:90%
to you, how reality works.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.770 align:middle line:84%
We are literally handing
you an instruction manual

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.470 align:middle line:84%
just like if someone handed
you an instruction manual

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to operate a piece of machinery.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.450 align:middle line:84%
If you follow the
instructions ABC,

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.650 align:middle line:84%
the machine will operate as
advertised to your advantage.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:84%
You don't follow
the instructions,

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.173 align:middle line:90%
you might injure yourself.

00:40:16.173 --> 00:40:18.440 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Just follow the
instruction manual.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Reality will work
to your advantage.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.650 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's designed to
do, this instruction manual.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We are literally describing how
reality works, not an opinion.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.740 align:middle line:90%
It's an observation.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:36.825 align:middle line:90%
Does this help?

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:37.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you define
metaphysical healing?

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> All healing is the so-called
healer giving off a frequency

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
in their energy field that
represents the healed state.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:41:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The person coming to them must
choose to match that frequency

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:02.620 align:middle line:90%
in order to heal themselves.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:07.000 align:middle line:84%
No healer ever
directly heals anybody.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.820 align:middle line:84%
You give them the option
and the opportunity

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.390 align:middle line:84%
to match a frequency that will
allow them to bring themselves

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.540 align:middle line:84%
into a healed state
should they so choose.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But you have to deal with
belief systems there too.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:25.270 align:middle line:84%
This is why many of your great
teachers actually never said,

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:27.490 align:middle line:90%
I have healed you.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.210 align:middle line:84%
They said, your
faith has healed you.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.710 align:middle line:90%
Your belief has healed you.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:35.700 align:middle line:90%
You understand?

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.600 align:middle line:84%
They knew what they
were talking about.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.120 align:middle line:84%
They understood they weren't
healing anyone directly.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:84%
They were simply
persuasively attempting

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to convince you to heal yourself
by letting go of the belief

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.860 align:middle line:84%
systems that kept you
out of the healed state

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to go back to your
natural state.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.520 align:middle line:84%
When a healer gives
off that vibration

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.730 align:middle line:84%
for someone who has
asked for that vibration,

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.490 align:middle line:84%
asked to be healed, you don't
know what their path is.

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
what their agenda is.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, a person
might go to a healer

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.580 align:middle line:90%
proving they can't be healed.

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So if they walk
away unhealed, they

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:84%
will say, see, I
told you so, which

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:84%
means the healer has given them
exactly what they asked for--

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:18.270 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to prove
they can't be healed.

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.940 align:middle line:84%
What this really means,
as you say on your planet,

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.980 align:middle line:84%
bottom line, when you have given
the gift, when you have set off

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.050 align:middle line:84%
the vibration that gives
them the choice to match it,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever they do with
what you've given them

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:36.140 align:middle line:90%
is none of your business.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Zero.

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know their
path, and you don't know what

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:44.000 align:middle line:84%
they're going to get out of that
maybe somewhere down the road.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Please remember, all of you,
you are eternal, infinite,

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.630 align:middle line:90%
indestructible beings.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.090 align:middle line:90%
There's no hurry.

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.120 align:middle line:90%
There's no rush.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.060 align:middle line:84%
If a lesson is not
learned here, it'll

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.630 align:middle line:84%
be learned somewhere
else in some other time

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in some other place.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You do your best to help
by being the example

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and giving the gift.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.680 align:middle line:84%
What they do with the
gift is not your business.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Is that a good
enough explanation

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.420 align:middle line:90%
of metaphysical healing?

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> One more.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So how would you
define metaphysics?

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Metaphysics in a very crude
and simplistic definition is

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.024 align:middle line:90%
physics without the math.

00:43:26.024 --> 00:43:29.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like a
elaborated version,

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:34.988 align:middle line:84%
like the most complicated
one you could give me.

00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:36.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, not the most complicated.

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:39.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would just like
more of elaboration on it.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.827 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:43:40.827 --> 00:43:43.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the understanding that
physical reality is the product

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of your consciousness and
adjusting patterns within

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.300 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness that then
create the reflection that is

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.600 align:middle line:84%
more in alignment with who
you have discovered yourself

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.170 align:middle line:90%
to truly be.

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:01.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:02.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:44:02.752 --> 00:44:05.704 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:05.704 --> 00:44:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.435 align:middle line:84%
You earth people love
complicating things.

00:44:11.435 --> 00:44:18.200 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] It really, honestly,
really is very simple.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But we understand that many
of the belief systems you've

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.930 align:middle line:84%
been taught allow you to believe
that if it's not complex,

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:27.260 align:middle line:90%
it's not worthwhile.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It has to be simple
in order to exist.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.890 align:middle line:84%
If it was really complicated,
it would fall apart

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.000 align:middle line:90%
under its own weight.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:84%
It can be richly
complex, but it's not

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.280 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally complicated--

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.620 align:middle line:84%
simple principles
that can expand

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.350 align:middle line:84%
into many, many complex
and rich experiences.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.620 align:middle line:90%
But the seed is very simple.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, what is the easiest way
to live our life on this planet

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:84%
and be connected with our higher
selves at all times because--

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.805 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean to know
that you're connected?

00:45:04.805 --> 00:45:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Because you always
are connected.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.120 align:middle line:84%
>> To be aware that
we are connected.

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:08.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.438 align:middle line:84%
It is exactly the
formula we gave.

00:45:11.438 --> 00:45:12.480 align:middle line:90%
Are you paying attention?

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you sure?

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Trying my best.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't try.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:17.863 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing my best.

00:45:17.863 --> 00:45:18.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Just pay attention.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:20.880 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready?

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Act every moment that
you can on whatever

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.080 align:middle line:84%
contains your highest
passion or more excitement

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.800 align:middle line:90%
than anything else.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Do it to the best you are
able in whatever circumstances

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.120 align:middle line:90%
present themselves to you to do.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Take it as far as you can until
you can take it no further.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Keep acting on the
next thing that

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
excites you more than
anything else over and over

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.060 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Take these actions
on your passion

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.390 align:middle line:84%
with zero insistence,
zero assumption,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.360 align:middle line:84%
as to what the
outcome ought to be.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.250 align:middle line:84%
Stay in a positive
state, no matter what

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.730 align:middle line:84%
happens, knowing you will
always get the benefit from it

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:02.030 align:middle line:90%
if you do so.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:03.465 align:middle line:90%
Done.

00:46:03.465 --> 00:46:04.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Simple.

00:46:04.265 --> 00:46:05.516 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:05.516 --> 00:46:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Now again, we can go into
all sorts of details and talk

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:16.050 align:middle line:84%
for hours and hours and hours
about all the details that are

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:90%
involved in that.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's fine because
the kit of passion

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.690 align:middle line:84%
does contain some
interesting tools.

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:23.970 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the driving
engine of your life.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.070 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
organizing principle

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.630 align:middle line:90%
of synchronicity in your life.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.048 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the path of least
resistance in your life.

00:46:30.048 --> 00:46:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the path
that connects you

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.350 align:middle line:84%
to all other expressions
of your excitement

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that are relevant
for you in your life.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.790 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the thing
that supports you

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.395 align:middle line:84%
in whatever form of
abundance you need support in

00:46:41.395 --> 00:46:44.310 align:middle line:84%
in order to continue to act
on your excitement in life.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It is also the reflective mirror
that reveals to you anything

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:49.348 align:middle line:84%
within your belief system
that is out of alignment

00:46:49.348 --> 00:46:51.390 align:middle line:84%
with your excitement so
that you can deal with it

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.800 align:middle line:84%
and let it go and
add that energy

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.600 align:middle line:84%
to the momentum
of your excitement

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.940 align:middle line:90%
and expand it in your life.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It leaves absolutely nothing
relevant out of your life.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.350 align:middle line:90%
It is a complete kit.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It is automatic,
self-guiding principle.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And just stay in the positive
state, no matter what happens.

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.173 align:middle line:84%
Because as we have said, it
doesn't matter what happens.

00:47:09.173 --> 00:47:11.760 align:middle line:84%
It matters what you do with what
happens because everything is

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.890 align:middle line:90%
neutral and serves double duty.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And the meaning you give
it determines the effect

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:17.400 align:middle line:90%
you get out of it.

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.390 align:middle line:84%
That is the entire
instruction manual.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:24.060 align:middle line:84%
As I said, we can go into all
sorts of details about each

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.795 align:middle line:84%
of those instructions
and what they mean

00:47:25.795 --> 00:47:28.170 align:middle line:84%
and how you can relate to them
and how you can understand

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.200 align:middle line:90%
them more deeply.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But there are no more
instructions in the manual.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.390 align:middle line:90%
That is A to Z as you say.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.712 align:middle line:84%
But the formula
that activates it--

00:47:38.712 --> 00:47:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and you don't even have to
think about the rest of it

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's automatic--
is you act on your passion

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to the best you can with zero
insistence or assumption it's

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.452 align:middle line:84%
the outcome and remain
in a positive state,

00:47:48.452 --> 00:47:49.410 align:middle line:90%
no matter what happens.

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.545 align:middle line:84%
That is the truncated,
simplistic version

00:47:51.545 --> 00:47:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that allows all the tools
to work to your advantage

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.630 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.444 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:47:56.444 --> 00:47:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:58.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.730 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:47:59.730 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.265 align:middle line:90%
Did that answer your question?

00:48:03.265 --> 00:48:07.793 align:middle line:90%


00:48:07.793 --> 00:48:09.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it answer your question?

00:48:09.085 --> 00:48:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>> She said yes.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess I don't
have a question anymore.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Because I was standing
in line and literally

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.678 align:middle line:84%
every single question
I had come up,

00:48:23.678 --> 00:48:24.970 align:middle line:90%
you would-- would get answered.

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> How synchronous of you.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So I mainly wanted to come up
here to say hello because--

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, a few years back,
I was going through a lot.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I ran into you
synchronistically.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.247 align:middle line:84%
And my life just started
to change incredibly.

00:48:40.247 --> 00:48:41.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you changed it.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:45.353 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I'm so thankful
that you're out here being you

00:48:45.353 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and expressing yourself so--

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't be anything else.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:53.480 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Don't you see the
most difficult thing to do

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.070 align:middle line:90%
is be someone you're not?

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you're
all trained to do.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I said that I would
come and say hello to you one

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.790 align:middle line:90%
day.

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:03.210 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying
hello to you today.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.010 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:07.949 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:07.949 --> 00:49:12.919 align:middle line:90%


00:49:12.919 --> 00:49:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.886 align:middle line:90%
>> Good day.

00:49:16.886 --> 00:49:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't know quite how
to frame my question.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to
make the attempt.

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.010 align:middle line:84%
But speak up and be
bold so that all may

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.210 align:middle line:90%
hear what you have to share.

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.910 align:middle line:90%


00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:30.370 align:middle line:84%
I became spiritually
awakened in December 2006.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've been on the
journey for a while now,

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.360 align:middle line:84%
but I don't feel like I'm at
the space or place that I really

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.320 align:middle line:90%
want to be on.

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:41.170 align:middle line:90%
I want more growth.

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, an expectation, an
assumption, an insistence.

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:49.030 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] I'm not
where I want to be.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> One moment.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:57.300 align:middle line:84%
May I share with you our
definition of abundance

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.380 align:middle line:90%
if you haven't heard it?

00:49:58.380 --> 00:49:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:49:59.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:00.342 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:50:00.342 --> 00:50:06.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The ability, the ability, to
do what you need to do when you

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.360 align:middle line:90%
need to do it.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Notice I didn't say want.

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Want can sometimes align
with what you truly need.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But very often in your society,
because of belief systems

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.840 align:middle line:84%
you hold onto that you
may not even be aware of,

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:27.440 align:middle line:84%
wants may often have nothing to
do with what you actually need.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.240 align:middle line:90%
They can turn into insistences.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.580 align:middle line:84%
If I don't experience this,
something has gone wrong.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.540 align:middle line:90%
That's a definition.

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not a fact.

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a belief.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:38.990 align:middle line:90%
It's an opinion.

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a perspective.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Why would you assume
that where you are now

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.359 align:middle line:84%
is not perfectly
where you need to be?

00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:49.912 align:middle line:90%


00:50:49.912 --> 00:50:50.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Um.

00:50:50.712 --> 00:50:51.512 align:middle line:90%
>> Um.

00:50:51.512 --> 00:50:56.230 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Why would
you assume that you

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:59.920 align:middle line:84%
needed to see something
happen specifically in order

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.860 align:middle line:84%
for you to know that you
are exactly, perfectly where

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.030 align:middle line:90%
you need to be?

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Why are you making
your state of being

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:09.040 align:middle line:84%
conditional on what happens
in an illusionary reality?

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.680 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did you think you were
supposed to be at this point?

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:18.488 align:middle line:90%
How did you picture it?

00:51:18.488 --> 00:51:19.405 align:middle line:90%
What did you envision?

00:51:19.405 --> 00:51:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:29.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I envisioned that I was
supposed to be like healthier

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.800 align:middle line:90%
in my health and my finances.

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:36.630 align:middle line:84%
I know those are
external factors.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:39.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're also
limited definitions

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.200 align:middle line:90%
because you're saying finances.

00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Is that the only
form of abundance

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:45.087 align:middle line:84%
you allow in your
life to be real?

00:51:45.087 --> 00:51:45.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:51:45.887 --> 00:51:47.054 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that at all.

00:51:47.054 --> 00:51:48.012 align:middle line:90%
I just think that's a--

00:51:48.012 --> 00:51:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Then why did you say it?

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I haven't--

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:51.950 align:middle line:90%
OK, so from--

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes?

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> From the teaching that I had
received previously meeting you

00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.880 align:middle line:84%
right now, I was taught
metaphysically that what--

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.430 align:middle line:84%
as I changed my
belief system and how

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I view and value and
see myself that I

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:12.650 align:middle line:84%
am supposed to be manifesting
those passions and desires.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you didn't see
them the way you thought,

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:21.040 align:middle line:84%
what kind of state
did you go into?

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.105 align:middle line:90%
>> I went into--

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it's more like
a slight disappointment.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.450 align:middle line:90%
But I know not to go there.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Stay there.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Stay there.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:28.380 align:middle line:90%
Be honest.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.040 align:middle line:90%
>> I know not to go there.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.040 align:middle line:90%
But I went there anyway.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:37.930 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] And what does
that mean that that was

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:84%
your reaction to what you
thought should be happening

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.580 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't?

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:90%
It means you haven't changed.

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.560 align:middle line:90%
So why should your reality?

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:51.450 align:middle line:90%
You see, you test yourselves.

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You go, am I going
to base what's

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.460 align:middle line:84%
going on in my life on
what happens outside?

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.370 align:middle line:84%
If I don't see what I thought
I was supposed to see,

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to stay
in a positive state?

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be disappointed.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to disappoint
myself from my seat of power.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.860 align:middle line:90%
You haven't changed.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:14.180 align:middle line:90%
So why should your reality?

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.960 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what happens.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.430 align:middle line:84%
It only matters what you
do with what happens.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.360 align:middle line:84%
That's the lesson here
not that you're supposed

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.460 align:middle line:90%
to see your reality change.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to be the
state you prefer to be even

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.580 align:middle line:90%
if your reality stays the same.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
can't be the state

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:35.920 align:middle line:84%
that you prefer to be in even
if your reality doesn't change,

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:39.000 align:middle line:90%
you haven't changed.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:45.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, this is kind of--
and I do not mean in any way,

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.070 align:middle line:84%
shape, or form any
offense at this.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:48.380 align:middle line:90%
Please don't take it that way.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of you know just enough
metaphysics to be dangerous.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:59.270 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] You learn a certain
amount of these principles.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And you apply them but
not necessarily as fully

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:06.770 align:middle line:84%
or in the precise way that it
actually needs to be applied.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:08.930 align:middle line:84%
You think it's supposed
to get you this.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:11.840 align:middle line:84%
When in fact, it might be
absolutely the opposite thing

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that you really
need to experience.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.850 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to not
base your state

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:20.300 align:middle line:84%
on what's going on or
not going on outside

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:22.170 align:middle line:90%
in the reflected reality.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep finding
yourself being disappointed

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.797 align:middle line:84%
when something doesn't happen
the way you thought it ought

00:54:26.797 --> 00:54:29.720 align:middle line:90%
to by now, you haven't changed.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.600 align:middle line:84%
You're just proving over and
over again that there is no

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.710 align:middle line:84%
reason for your reality to
change because you haven't.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:40.960 align:middle line:90%
[CRYING] Yes.

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all right.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Let it out.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:45.880 align:middle line:90%
Remember, this is good.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This emotional
response is positive.

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Because when you hold
onto negative beliefs,

00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.970 align:middle line:84%
you have to create
a chemical component

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:58.210 align:middle line:84%
in your body to match the
belief on a physical level.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:02.020 align:middle line:84%
When you're finally letting go
of limiting negative beliefs,

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:05.240 align:middle line:84%
you have to wash those chemical
constituents out of your body.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.520 align:middle line:90%
How do you do it?

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Tears.

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.780 align:middle line:84%
They're tears of relief, tears
of release, tears of joy.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's good to have this
response of your tears

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:20.188 align:middle line:84%
because you're washing
the negative chemicals out

00:55:20.188 --> 00:55:21.730 align:middle line:84%
of your body that
were representative

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.400 align:middle line:84%
of the beliefs you were
holding onto that now you're

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.447 align:middle line:90%
beginning to let go of.

00:55:25.447 --> 00:55:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because now, you have
a deeper understanding

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.540 align:middle line:90%
of how this actually works.

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.060 align:middle line:90%


00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all right to
go through life--

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:36.426 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:36.426 --> 00:55:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.990 align:middle line:84%
It's all right to go
through life being happy

00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:45.890 align:middle line:84%
even if what you assumed
would happen hasn't happened.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's all right to choose
to be happy no matter what.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:51.780 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It's OK as a choice.

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:55:56.910 --> 00:56:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, you can use
visualization all you want.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:04.680 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful tool.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.030 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand what
visualization is actually for.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Visualizing an
ideal outcome is not

00:56:14.050 --> 00:56:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to insist that that must be
the way the outcome happens.

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is for
the purpose of creating

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:26.560 align:middle line:84%
a symbolic representation
of an ideal outcome that

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:32.740 align:middle line:84%
gets you so excited about
the possibility of that kind

00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.590 align:middle line:84%
of an outcome that you
get into the excited state

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:37.780 align:middle line:90%
you need to be in.

00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Then once you're in
the excited state,

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:45.370 align:middle line:84%
you drop the picture utterly
so that your higher mind

00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.970 align:middle line:84%
can bring you what it
really needs to bring you

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:51.490 align:middle line:84%
because you don't know
on the physical level

00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.130 align:middle line:84%
if the picture you have
in your physical mind

00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:57.700 align:middle line:90%
is actually the ideal outcome.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Your higher mind could
bring you something

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.553 align:middle line:84%
10 times greater than your
physical mind could imagine.

00:57:02.553 --> 00:57:03.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you sit
there and insist,

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:08.380 align:middle line:84%
no, it's got to look like
this, or something's wrong,

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.260 align:middle line:84%
you're shutting the door to what
your higher mind could bring

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:13.710 align:middle line:90%
you that could be greater.

00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:15.960 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to get your physical
mind used to the understanding

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:22.680 align:middle line:84%
that you don't know what
the ideal outcome for you

00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:23.910 align:middle line:90%
actually is.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes yes, it might
match your vision,

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.240 align:middle line:84%
might be very close, might
even be identical, sometimes.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:34.260 align:middle line:84%
But you don't know that
that's what it needs to be.

00:57:34.260 --> 00:57:38.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand, if
you start understanding,

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:40.590 align:middle line:84%
that insisting on
the visualization

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:43.853 align:middle line:84%
is actually a negative
limitation that prevents you

00:57:43.853 --> 00:57:46.020 align:middle line:84%
from experiencing something
greater that your higher

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.480 align:middle line:84%
mind can bring you,
you'll stop doing it.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll stop insisting.

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Remember, here's a formula.

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:54.510 align:middle line:90%
Insistence equals resistance.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:56.690 align:middle line:90%
You slow everything down.

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:58.610 align:middle line:84%
You block the doorways
through which things

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.920 align:middle line:84%
could be coming to
you because you're

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.200 align:middle line:84%
getting in your own way
with your assumptions

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.840 align:middle line:84%
about the way things
are supposed to be.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.350 align:middle line:90%
There is no supposed to.

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Let it be what it is.

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Everything that comes
to you, whatever

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.340 align:middle line:84%
it is that's coming to you, is
exactly perfect for what it is.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Use it.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Stay in the positive
state and use it.

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be there if
there wasn't a reason for it.

00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You need to trust the
way reality works.

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.260 align:middle line:90%
You need to trust the mechanism.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.660 align:middle line:90%
You need to trust the structure.

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Just go with the flow.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Relax.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Because if you know that
no matter what happens it's

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:39.430 align:middle line:84%
always going to benefit you,
what do you care what happens?

00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:46.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] That's power.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:47.690 align:middle line:90%
That's power.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.330 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what happens.

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:51.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how things look.

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what doesn't happen.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:56.280 align:middle line:90%
It will always benefit me.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.690 align:middle line:90%
That's power.

00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:59.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a position of power.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.920 align:middle line:90%
That's self-empowerment.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Stay there.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.670 align:middle line:90%
Don't leave it.

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.620 align:middle line:84%
Unless of course,
you like to suffer.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:12.260 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] I won't stop
you if that's your passion.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But understand you don't
have to make that choice.

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:19.920 align:middle line:90%
Is this helping?

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:22.367 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

00:59:22.367 --> 00:59:25.162 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:25.162 --> 00:59:39.060 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, Bashar.

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting
what I just heard.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:47.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all right.

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:48.450 align:middle line:90%
I think so too.

00:59:48.450 --> 00:59:51.890 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Or I probably
wouldn't have said it.

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:57.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Because like,
that's how I feel.

00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that I
changed, that I allowed myself

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to change.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, gratitude, appreciation.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate yourselves.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Be in a state of grace
about yourselves.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.980 align:middle line:90%
You deserve it.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And because I did
that, I am here now.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And feels really good.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:22.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Feels really good.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.470 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Feels
really good, baby.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll do a little Elvis for
you later tonight downtown.

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So music for me,
synchronicities for me, I feel

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:47.170 align:middle line:90%
are truckloads emptying down.

01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And why is music so--

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's all
about resonance.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.802 align:middle line:90%
It's all about frequency.

01:00:52.802 --> 01:00:53.890 align:middle line:90%
It's all about vibration.

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:54.790 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:55.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Amazing grace.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And we see-- yes.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And we see and feel
and hear words.

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.185 align:middle line:84%
Let it be, you said
earlier with the young lady

01:01:07.185 --> 01:01:08.060 align:middle line:90%
that was here before.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.650 align:middle line:90%
Let it be.

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%
Let it be.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Let it be.

01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:13.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so many that are just
popping up left and right all

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:16.120 align:middle line:90%
the time.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.000 align:middle line:84%
What can you tell
us about music?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I just told you.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And the music though
that we've been listening

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.270 align:middle line:84%
to for the last 40 years and
how it's resonating with us now.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Again, you gravitate
to what works for you.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It's all permission slips.

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
You understand our concept
of permission slips?

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.145 align:middle line:90%
Do you need a refresher?

01:01:34.145 --> 01:01:34.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:34.945 --> 01:01:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
>> All tools, all techniques,
all rituals, all objects,

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
are permission slips, which
means your belief system

01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
gravitates to whatever it is
at any given moment that aligns

01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:57.200 align:middle line:84%
with your belief system in
such a way as it will allow you

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to give yourself permission
to be more of who you are.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So all techniques, all
tools, all objects,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.780 align:middle line:84%
all rituals,
including music, are

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
permission slips
that align with you

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:13.550 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allow you
to transcend your beliefs.

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
Now you're the one doing it.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You're the ultimate
permission slip.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Those things aren't
actually doing it for you.

01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But they are doing it with
you because you are believing

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.160 align:middle line:90%
that this will do this for you.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Then you are using
it to allow yourself

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to change, to give yourself
permission to change

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.390 align:middle line:90%
in ways that you prefer to.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So music, words, art,
anything, rituals,

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:50.760 align:middle line:84%
meditation, gongs, crystals,
tea leaves, it doesn't matter.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
They're all reflections of a
portion of your consciousness

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
that says, that
is going to allow

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
me to supersede my belief system
in a way that I prefer to.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.920 align:middle line:90%
So I will use it.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.055 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you start
to realize since you

01:03:04.055 --> 01:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
are the ultimate
permission slip,

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
you don't eventually really
need much of those other things.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
You can still have
them for enjoyment.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But you start to
realize you don't really

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:16.290 align:middle line:90%
need them to change.

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:17.420 align:middle line:90%
Is this making some sense?

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And it becomes fun.

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is
music to your ears.

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> (SINGING) Do you believe
in magic in a young girl's--

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Bashar.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.474 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:32.474 --> 01:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%


01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey, Bashar.

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a question about
the nature of reality,

01:03:55.240 --> 01:04:01.305 align:middle line:84%
virtual reality, and living in
the layers of it and with that,

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:02.105 align:middle line:90%
the--

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:02.915 align:middle line:90%
>> Speak up.

01:04:02.915 --> 01:04:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Speak up.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> With that, the Archons that
manipulate the reality in which

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.250 align:middle line:90%
we live in.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:08.741 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.232 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

01:04:09.232 --> 01:04:09.723 align:middle line:90%
>> Nope.

01:04:09.723 --> 01:04:10.214 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:11.196 align:middle line:90%
Nope.

01:04:11.196 --> 01:04:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.085 align:middle line:90%
>> And the ascension--

01:04:14.085 --> 01:04:14.885 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] Why are you
continuing beyond that point?

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Nobody manipulates the
reality you live in but you.

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.030 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Even if someone
offers you the idea

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.270 align:middle line:84%
that they're manipulating you,
you have to agree with that

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and match that frequency
in order to experience it

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.610 align:middle line:90%
in your reality.

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
That's an old-fashioned,
outdated definition

01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that someone else can
manipulate your reality.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.642 align:middle line:84%
I understand that that's a
description of how it feels.

01:04:44.642 --> 01:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's the difference
between a description

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
of an experience
and a description

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
of the actual underlying
mechanism at hand

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.360 align:middle line:90%
that's creating the experience.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
No one can manipulate
your reality but you.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
But you can pretend
that someone can

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
by buying into a belief
system that they are.

01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.370 align:middle line:90%
Is this understandable?

01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.310 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So what else were
you going to say?

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The ascension through
the layers of reality.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:21.100 align:middle line:90%
So if it's virtual--

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.100 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all virtual.

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, right.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's layers
to the virtual.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you create
layers for your process.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and the ascension
through those layers or--

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the raising of your
frequency so that you can

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
perceive more of the idea that
there aren't really layers.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the mirrors
that surround the soul.

01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The mirrors again are
simply reflections for you

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.550 align:middle line:84%
to determine what
it is you prefer,

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to reflect to you what you
believe to be true so that you

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.220 align:middle line:84%
can decide whether or not to
maintain that belief or change

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.268 align:middle line:90%
it.

01:05:53.268 --> 01:05:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that helping?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and the catapult
for this, the catapult and--

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The catapult?

01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, so--

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
mean by that term?

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's say going in nature and
spending time like for 10 days.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, so you're talking about
different forms of what we just

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
spoke about when we talked
about permission slips.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you elaborate?

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I just did.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I explained what
permission slips are.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Specifically in raising the
consciousness to a higher level

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or what you would say the shift
in earth that is occurring

01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:30.510 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you act on your passion
to the best you can with no

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.480 align:middle line:90%
insistence on the outcome.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.230 align:middle line:84%
That's how you continually
raise your vibration.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the formula.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.200 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're giving you the
formula to do that very thing.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Then what happens
when you biolocate,

01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
when you're in two
places at once?

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to understand that
you do exist in all places

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.990 align:middle line:84%
at once but that
all places are here.

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:58.865 align:middle line:84%
You're only imagining them
to be different places.

01:06:58.865 --> 01:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
You're simply seeing yourself
from different perspectives

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:03.610 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously in
the same place.

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
There is only one moment
and only one place--

01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%
here and now.

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So anything that you
experience, whether it

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.940 align:middle line:84%
be a single projection
or a multiple projection,

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.850 align:middle line:84%
what you're referring
to as biolocation,

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
is just another
perspective of the reality

01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:20.390 align:middle line:90%
that exists here and now.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:24.272 align:middle line:84%
And you're injecting a
concept of distance into it.

01:07:24.272 --> 01:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as distance.

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.690 align:middle line:90%
That's an illusion.

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:31.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So when these things
happen simultaneously--

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:33.570 align:middle line:84%
so when you biolocate, and
you're in these both places

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, you
see both realities

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.810 align:middle line:90%
occurring at the same time--

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they already
exist simultaneously.

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.910 align:middle line:84%
So you're expanding
your senses to be

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%
able to incorporate more than
one perspective simultaneously.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And the fractals that
we see everywhere, how--

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Fractals are an expression
pattern of consciousness that

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
underlies the foundation of
what you call physical reality.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
You had to create a structure
in a sense in your consciousness

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to build
physical reality on.

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
a energy template

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that reveals itself in these
fractal, mathematical ratio

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
patterns because
it's showing you

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
what the vibrational
pattern is you've

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.430 align:middle line:84%
created in your
consciousness in order

01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:16.439 align:middle line:84%
to create the illusion
of physical reality.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
You're looking at the
blueprint so to speak.

01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:20.939 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I see it
as a wired frame.

01:08:20.939 --> 01:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
It's like a loading frame.

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.342 align:middle line:90%
And then but it's empty space.

01:08:26.342 --> 01:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just nothing but--

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.498 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, all right.

01:08:28.498 --> 01:08:29.790 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to interpret it.

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But there's actually
no such thing as empty.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, everything
and nothing.

01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is everything.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but even
nothing is something.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Remember, there's no such
thing as nonexistence actually.

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:42.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, so that's--

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So even nothing is something.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:46.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that help?

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.638 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:50.638 --> 01:08:55.479 align:middle line:90%


01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Nice to be a part of
your reality again, Bashar.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.609 align:middle line:90%
>> And yours as well.

01:09:00.609 --> 01:09:01.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:06.040 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, we talked
about time travel and time

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.060 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And it seems in this
discussion, we're

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.979 align:middle line:84%
upgrading permission
slips in a sense.

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
So what I didn't ask back
then about five years ago

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.979 align:middle line:84%
is there a technology
besides our consciousness

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:21.769 align:middle line:84%
that we can create that
will facilitate time travel,

01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:22.569 align:middle line:90%
a machine?

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, except time travel
isn't what you think it is.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
There is no time travel in what
you call the science fiction

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:31.120 align:middle line:90%
sense.

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.029 align:middle line:84%
What you're actually doing is
shifting to a parallel reality

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:36.819 align:middle line:84%
that simply looks remarkably
similar to the one you consider

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to be your past.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's not the same timeline.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.890 align:middle line:90%
But it can't be.

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Would there be a
machine that can help us--

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What does that look-- what's
the technology of that machine?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have to create a
device that will create a kind

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of energy bubble that isolates
you from any particular reality

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
so that you can impose upon it
the frequency of the reality,

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the parallel reality,
you prefer to experience.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you impose that upon
it and then remove the bubble,

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.990 align:middle line:84%
you will wind up in that
reality because you've

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
shifted your frequency location
to a parallel reality one.

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:14.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that take a type of
physics to know how to do that,

01:10:14.288 --> 01:10:15.088 align:middle line:90%
isolate the--

01:10:15.088 --> 01:10:16.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's all physics.

01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and can you give us a
clue besides what you've given

01:10:19.450 --> 01:10:23.320 align:middle line:84%
us about what we would need to
create to isolate that reality?

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the idea first is
to do the experiment we have

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
suggested, which very few of you
wind up doing, which is this.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a flat table at
least 10 feet long.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:39.025 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, flat
as you can make it.

01:10:39.025 --> 01:10:40.270 align:middle line:90%
You with me so far?

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm with you.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Have a hollow sphere.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It can be copper.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It can be steel.

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:51.160 align:middle line:90%
Allow it to be about this big.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.250 align:middle line:90%
Rest it on one end of the table.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.400 align:middle line:90%
Then get it to vibrate somehow.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
You can strike it
and take a recording

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:01.970 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency it gives off.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
You can shall we say
induce a vibration

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.763 align:middle line:84%
through acoustic means
or electromagnetic means,

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.680 align:middle line:84%
whatever technology you
have at your disposal.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
But get it to
vibrate such that you

01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
have instruments that
can actually determine

01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:17.360 align:middle line:90%
its overall frequency.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Make the sphere as perfectly
spherical as you can

01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and as thin as you can.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's hollow.

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So there isn't
that much material

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
to resonate, just enough
so you get the frequency.

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Now once you've recorded that
frequency, pick up the sphere

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.940 align:middle line:84%
and put it at the
other end of the table.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Then do it again.

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Take a recording
of its frequency

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.160 align:middle line:90%
at the other end of the table.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Now if your instrumentation
is sensitive enough--

01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
this is the question about
the level of your technology

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and whether it's precise
enough or sensitive enough--

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
if your instrumentation you're
recording the vibration on

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.410 align:middle line:84%
is sensitive enough,
you should actually

01:11:57.410 --> 01:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
see that there is a difference
in the frequencies, even

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.770 align:middle line:90%
a minute one.

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is
from our perspective,

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
objects do not
exist in a location.

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Location is one of the
variables in an object.

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the energy
equation of the object.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So if you can measure
the difference,

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:22.580 align:middle line:90%
then you take that ball.

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.890 align:middle line:90%
Put it back at the beginning.

01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And now you again surround
it, immerse it, overwhelm it

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
in a sense, with
a vibration that

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
represents the signature of
the other position, position B.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:41.510 align:middle line:84%
When you overwhelm the mass
of that object sufficiently,

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:43.790 align:middle line:84%
it will, at least
in your reality,

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
probably at first roll
to the new position that

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:50.810 align:middle line:84%
represents the second location
because you've changed

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
the locational frequency.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:55.400 align:middle line:84%
If you can actually
overwhelm it enough,

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
it will actually stop
existing at location A

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and instantaneously
exist at location

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
B. That's how we travel
from star to star.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you-- but you have to
know the vibration of let's say

01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
two years ago in order
to travel back two years,

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.710 align:middle line:84%
or into the future, you
have to know that vibration?

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Understand that even your
Einstein knew that space time

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:18.360 align:middle line:90%
is one thing.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you have the
vibrational location of space,

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
there is also a temporal
vibration, a location

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.030 align:middle line:90%
that comes along with it.

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:27.620 align:middle line:90%
So you can always do that.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.900 align:middle line:84%
But again remember, you're
never actually going back

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:32.120 align:middle line:90%
to exactly the same place.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.360 align:middle line:84%
It's always a parallel reality,
always, always, always.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.520 align:middle line:84%
You can sort of prove
this to yourself

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
on a very fundamental level,
a very basic level, when

01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you talk about the
concept of time travel

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.740 align:middle line:90%
in the following analogy.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Let us say you are 10 years old.

01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:49.345 align:middle line:84%
And you take a
picture of yourself.

01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And then you
develop the picture.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.320 align:middle line:90%
And there it is.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320 align:middle line:90%
You put it on the table.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.350 align:middle line:84%
There is the picture
of you at 10.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Now you grow up.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:56.930 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you're 30 years old.

01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And you take a picture
of yourself at 30.

01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:02.343 align:middle line:84%
And at 30, you now
invent your time machine.

01:14:02.343 --> 01:14:03.260 align:middle line:90%
So you say, all right.

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
in my time machine.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go back and
visit myself when I was 10.

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.980 align:middle line:90%
So you get in your time machine.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And you turn the dials
and flip the switches

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.200 align:middle line:90%
and ooh, blinky lights.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.040 align:middle line:90%
And you step out.

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you
meet this 10-year-old

01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:21.650 align:middle line:84%
who is theoretically
you when you were 10.

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And you take another picture
of your 30-year-old self

01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:25.562 align:middle line:90%
with the 10-year-old self.

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And you put that on the
table, along with the picture

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.057 align:middle line:84%
of the 10-year-old and the
picture of the 30-year-old

01:14:30.057 --> 01:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
and now the picture
of the 30-year-old

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.320 align:middle line:90%
with the 10-year-old.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.060 align:middle line:84%
What's the first
thing you notice?

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:39.090 align:middle line:84%
All three pictures
exist simultaneously,

01:14:39.090 --> 01:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
which means you didn't
change the first picture.

01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
You weren't there then.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
What you've done is
gone into the reality

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.070 align:middle line:90%
of another 10-year-old.

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:50.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why there
can be no such thing

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:53.360 align:middle line:84%
as the so-called
grandfather paradox

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.760 align:middle line:84%
where you go back in time,
you kill your grandfather,

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.920 align:middle line:84%
you were never born,
and you cease to exist.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:01.190 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:03.890 align:middle line:84%
What you would be doing is
going into a parallel reality

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:05.490 align:middle line:90%
where things are very similar.

01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
You would kill a
grandfather in that reality.

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And in that reality,
that version of you

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:13.770 align:middle line:90%
would never be born.

01:15:13.770 --> 01:15:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But it has nothing to do
with your reality stream.

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is no position D
in that first example for that

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.330 align:middle line:90%
object to really go back to?

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:15:23.130 --> 01:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, because it's
always changing.

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> You have your
own zen monk saying,

01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:31.610 align:middle line:84%
you can't step into
the same river twice.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, back to the future.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:34.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.566 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:40.542 align:middle line:90%


01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello again, Bashar.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.395 align:middle line:90%
>> And to you, good day.

01:15:43.395 --> 01:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a very interesting
event last night.

01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend open up to me
about an abduction experience.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all right.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:49.560 align:middle line:90%
How exciting.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very exciting.

01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It's my favorite kind of thing.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And he noted at the end of
it that the next morning, he

01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
had a lump in the top
of his ear that he

01:15:58.290 --> 01:15:59.740 align:middle line:90%
perceived to be an implant.

01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And without knowing
my story, I actually

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:08.095 align:middle line:84%
have the same what I perceive to
be an implant as well that I--

01:16:08.095 --> 01:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are you going
to do, start a club?

01:16:09.970 --> 01:16:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think we
already have a club.

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.130 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was
gonna ask about.

01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.480 align:middle line:90%
But mine--

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to the implant club.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me check your ear
on the way in the door.

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> But mine formed right around
the time I started working with

01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:27.525 align:middle line:84%
plant medicine and opened
myself up to all that.

01:16:27.525 --> 01:16:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So I was just wondering if
you could touch on that a bit?

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.770 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you want me to touch?

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:36.300 align:middle line:90%
>> My ear, apparently.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What do I need to say
that you don't already know?

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.110 align:middle line:90%
Do you have a specific question?

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, are he and I
connected in a deeper way?

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I--

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe me?

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.250 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:49.260 align:middle line:90%
I guess I already knew.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And well, I guess, we can
just go a little deeper.

01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
In my plant ceremonies,
I have had encounters

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:55.830 align:middle line:90%
with the Mantid race.

01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering if you could
tell me about them and my place

01:16:58.810 --> 01:16:59.610 align:middle line:90%
with them.

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> They are the overseers.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.930 align:middle line:90%
Understand this.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:06.870 align:middle line:84%
We are collapsing
a very long story

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:08.230 align:middle line:90%
into a very brief statement.

01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:09.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The beings that you know as
the Greys are a mutated race

01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:18.120 align:middle line:84%
of humans from a parallel
version of Earth.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
They used to look just like you.

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:22.613 align:middle line:90%
Not you specifically.

01:17:22.613 --> 01:17:24.030 align:middle line:84%
The idea being
that they destroyed

01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:27.050 align:middle line:84%
their version of Earth
and had to mutate

01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:28.370 align:middle line:90%
themselves to survive.

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
They lost the
ability to reproduce.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, in order to
perpetuate their civilization,

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.845 align:middle line:84%
they had to use their
advanced technology to tunnel

01:17:34.845 --> 01:17:36.860 align:middle line:84%
into parallel reality
versions of Earth

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
where human DNA was still viable
such as in your reality so they

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
can extract that DNA, create
hybrid races such as ourselves,

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and thus perpetuate
their society

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.170 align:middle line:90%
and their culture in that way.

01:17:48.170 --> 01:17:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Recognizing that we owe you
a debt for having created us

01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
from your DNA and
their DNA, we share

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
these informational
things with you

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
to help you avoid the same
path because we observe

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
that your world might be heading
down a similar path that they

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:05.350 align:middle line:84%
took that destroyed
their version of Earth.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:07.350 align:middle line:90%
Short story.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But the idea is is that
at a certain point when they

01:18:12.970 --> 01:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
realized what a tremendous
undertaking it would be

01:18:17.710 --> 01:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
to create the hybridization
agenda in order to perpetuate

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.400 align:middle line:84%
their civilization, they knew
that the only way they could

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.340 align:middle line:84%
achieve it would be by giving
up any vestige of their humanity

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a hive mind so they
could work efficiently enough

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:37.570 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
actually achieve the goal.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
In order to then
guide them, they still

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.180 align:middle line:84%
needed a race of beings who
could oversee the project.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Those are the Mantids.

01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I completely do.

01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that help?

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:50.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It helps a lot.

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:51.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:55.366 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:18:55.366 --> 01:18:59.340 align:middle line:90%


01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Greetings, oh hallowed one.

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:02.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:04.020 align:middle line:90%
How formal.

01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, greetings back to you,
oh hallowed one as well.

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:09.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking that
I would like to know

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
how my grandmother who passed
away many years was doing.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>> She's probably doing fine.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and then I was
thinking about how people often

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
go to see a psychic or meditate
or whatever to get in touch

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:24.900 align:middle line:90%
with loved ones.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Really, where are
our loved ones?

01:19:26.590 --> 01:19:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> What happens when they go?

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.198 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:31.740 align:middle line:84%
But they're on a
different frequency.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:32.820 align:middle line:90%
They're on a different plane.

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.150 align:middle line:90%
But everything is right here.

01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Remember, everything overlaps.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
But it's a different vibration
that's mostly invisible to you.

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:40.440 align:middle line:90%
But they're right here.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not saying they hang
around you all the time.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
They have their lives to live.

01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
They have things to do.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
They have places to
go and people to see.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But because they're
operating in a dimension

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
that time and space are
not as structured in,

01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:57.630 align:middle line:90%
they'll know when you need them.

01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:58.980 align:middle line:90%
They'll be there.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
They'll make that connection.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you may experience
it through synchronicity

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:04.400 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.100 align:middle line:84%
That might be a
message from them.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, even when you have
a belief system that you've

01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:12.450 align:middle line:84%
lost someone and suddenly find
yourself thinking about them

01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and grieving, that
might actually

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:17.220 align:middle line:84%
be them attempting
to connect to you.

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But you're interpreting
their energy

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
through the negative idea
that you've lost them.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.668 align:middle line:84%
And so you feel grief
instead of the connection.

01:20:24.668 --> 01:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There can be many ways
that they can communicate.

01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
But mostly, they will
communicate through the methods

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:31.498 align:middle line:84%
that are right in
front of your face

01:20:31.498 --> 01:20:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because that's the easiest
way to get information

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.437 align:middle line:90%
across to you.

01:20:34.437 --> 01:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So you might synchronistically
see something

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:37.590 align:middle line:90%
that reminds you of them.

01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
That might be them
saying howdy, I'm OK.

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:46.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You know that everyone
says that our bodies cease.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:47.730 align:middle line:90%
But our energy continues.

01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:48.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, of course.

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And so how does it--

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.262 align:middle line:84%
>> But your bodies
don't even really cease.

01:20:51.262 --> 01:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
But that's another issue.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.227 align:middle line:84%
Because everything is
here and now, everything.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:58.560 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you're shifting
your focus so that you're

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
no longer physically oriented.

01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:02.470 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:03.300 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand it looks
like the body goes away.

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, that's an effect
of your spacetime framework.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so is it true then
that we continue to be reborn

01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:14.090 align:middle line:90%
and have many, many lives?

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an experience
you can create.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
underlying mechanism.

01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:21.650 align:middle line:84%
Because again, everything
exists all at once.

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
That means every single
person exists now.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So you as a person have
never been anyone else.

01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And no one else can
actually become you

01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:33.020 align:middle line:84%
because all the people
exist right now.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing is you're
creating energy connections

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to them, to other people
that simultaneously coexist

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:42.230 align:middle line:84%
with you right now
but in what you

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:46.010 align:middle line:84%
call the past or the future
or alternate realities.

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And you are downloading
information and experience

01:21:48.650 --> 01:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
from them that helps you in
your theme of exploration

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:54.890 align:middle line:84%
in this life just like they
might be doing with you.

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:57.095 align:middle line:84%
But this is a dynamically
changing thing.

01:21:57.095 --> 01:21:58.470 align:middle line:84%
As you become a
different person,

01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:01.130 align:middle line:84%
you might unplug from this
one and plug into another one

01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and download
different information.

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But from your
spacetime perspective,

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:13.490 align:middle line:84%
you interpret that connection
as a memory of the past.

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:16.630 align:middle line:90%
So you think it's my past life.

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not yours at all.

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.040 align:middle line:90%
It's theirs.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a different person.

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
But this is the reason why
you can have the old chestnut

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
as you say of 50 different
people saying, I was Cleopatra.

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, can they all be right?

01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because none of
them were Cleopatra.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.870 align:middle line:84%
But they can all connect
to Cleopatra energetically

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and download information.

01:22:40.700 --> 01:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But you're interpreting
the present connection

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:46.820 align:middle line:84%
as a past memory because
of your linear framework.

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.990 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So you can create the
experience of reincarnation.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was born.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And then I died.

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Then I was born.

01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
And then I would die.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But that's just a linear
framework experiential creation

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.060 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:02.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not an actual description
of the underlying causal

01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:03.260 align:middle line:90%
mechanism.

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:04.160 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that help?

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, totally.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm honored.

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>> If those lives were
truly in the past,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
you would never be able
to connect to them.

01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The only reason
you can connect is

01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:21.270 align:middle line:90%
because everything exists now.

01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:22.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Could you repeat that?

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I can.

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>> If things were
truly in the past,

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:30.480 align:middle line:84%
if the past was really past,
there would be no way you could

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.280 align:middle line:90%
reach them.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
You'd be no way you could have
a memory because memory is also

01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:35.960 align:middle line:90%
created in the present.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.910 align:middle line:84%
You would never be able
to connect to them.

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%
You would never know about them.

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.870 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can even
know about such lives

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and such experiences is if
everything exists right now.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Make sense?

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, good.

01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is, it also depends
when you say these things what

01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:53.390 align:middle line:90%
level you're coming from.

01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
As a physical person, you
can't say, I was that person.

01:23:57.750 --> 01:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But as the oversoul you
that is extending souls,

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.770 align:middle line:84%
individual soul extensions,
down into multiple incarnations

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:10.670 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, the oversoul
can say, I am that person,

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and I'm that person,
and I'm that person,

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:14.610 align:middle line:90%
and I'm that person.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
oversoul perspective.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:24:18.230 --> 01:24:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:20.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Is this helping?

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:21.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's heavy duty.

01:24:21.843 --> 01:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it doesn't
weigh anything at all.

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:26.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank heavens.

01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:29.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, will that do?

01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:30.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you very much.

01:24:30.657 --> 01:24:31.615 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

01:24:31.615 --> 01:24:37.920 align:middle line:90%


01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> So thank you, Bashar.

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the end of our
meeting today and--

01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And the beginning of another
some other time and place

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.950 align:middle line:84%
in your framework
of space and time.

01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:53.310 align:middle line:84%
We thank you all
for the co-creation

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
of this interaction with us.

01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Our unconditional
love to you all.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And we bid you all an
exciting day of exploration,

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.950 align:middle line:90%
self-discovery, and play.

01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
Please remember, life is fun.

01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Live it that way.

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.060 align:middle line:90%
Lighten up on yourselves.

01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Good day.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:15.818 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:15.818 --> 01:25:30.952 align:middle line:90%


01:25:30.952 --> 01:25:32.160 align:middle line:90%
Did you all have a good time?

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for being here.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.310 align:middle line:90%
We really appreciate it.

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Please have a wonderful,
wonderful evening.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:38.500 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:43.744 align:middle line:90%
