00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Without further ado, let's
give a big round of applause

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and welcome Kaia

[CHEERING]

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.732 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to see you.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.280 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you have traveled
so far to be here this evening,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to say
thank you for this,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to be that important
to you that you

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:90%
wanted to be here this evening.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an honor to
be here, and I'd

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.050 align:middle line:84%
like to thank Conscious
Life Expo for inviting me

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:84%
back this year, as well
as the Gaia platform.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
It's just great to be here
with this community again.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to start
with an opening prayer.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got some pretty deep
topics to cover this evening,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and what I have found in
my ministry, especially

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:90%
the last year--

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
I traveled all over the
world for this ministry,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and what I have found is that
we can talk about any topic

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:84%
through Christ
consciousness and stay out

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual warfare of it.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
fall prey to dualism

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
or stay in that polarized state
for us to birth a new paradigm.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we have to birth
beyond this current paradigm.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.392 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
that we don't discuss

00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
what we're living
through, which is

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
the transition from this
current paradigm into the one

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.420 align:middle line:84%
that we're actively birthing
while surviving the old one,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.380 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't put our
heads in the sand,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is
literally a spirit--

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:84%
there is a spiritual war
being waged over this planet.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK to talk
about that when we're not

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590 align:middle line:84%
coming from a victimhood place
but from a place within us that

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.830 align:middle line:84%
knows that we came here as
the answer to our own prayers.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.709 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.557 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:90%
And I don't say that lightly.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:84%
As some of you know from
the preface of my book,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.960 align:middle line:84%
"The Sophia Code," I personally
survived some of the darkest

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
atrocities that you can
survive on this planet,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
so my personal embodiment,
the microcosm of my life,

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
is a testimony to what we
can heal in the macrocosm.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's-- hi.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important to remember

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
how vital your embodiment
of these teachings of Sophia

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Christ consciousness is making
an impact for dissolving

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
the old paradigm
while simultaneously

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:90%
birthing the new paradigm.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.280 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
divine feminine

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
or divine masculine
Christ consciousness,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about is a--

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:90%
excuse me-- leadership.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking
about is a leadership

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
that can't be regurgitated.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not about keeping
all your facts straight.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not about remembering
every line in a book

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
and having all
the right answers.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It's about that
authentic embodiment

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of this consciousness.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
I think we have a
microphone up here

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.490 align:middle line:84%
that might be in conflict,
so we might want to--

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about embodying
this consciousness in such

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.488 align:middle line:84%
a way that you are always in the
right place at the right time,

00:03:45.488 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to figure out what

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
to say because it's being
downloaded into you directly

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
from your own higher self,
and your own higher self

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
is directly connected
to the source.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm sure there's many
people in this room that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.530 align:middle line:84%
know that, but there is millions
upon millions of human beings

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that do not, and that's
the crisis we're in.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:84%
The crisis that we're
in is that there are so

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:84%
many traditional forms of
programming on this planet

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that are designed to
separate us from the truth

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are sovereign,
holy, and divine,

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and that we have absolute access
to all information that we

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:84%
need, including how to
impact the lives of others,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:90%
directly from our own source.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
So we're in this journey
right now that I like--

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorite words
is "reconciliation."

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We're in a journey
of reconciliation

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:84%
with our own sovereign divinity
through divine feminine Christ

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:84%
consciousness first,
because we are so

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.890 align:middle line:84%
wounded by the patriarchy as a
collective, men and women both.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
This is not just
women being wounded.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
We are all suffering from
the patriarchal programming

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that we've been surviving
for centuries now, right?

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we step into divine
feminine Christ consciousness,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
we're stepping into the
consciousness that intuitively

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
knows how to receive the
healings that we need

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to then become whole enough
in ourselves to identify what

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
the real true meaning of divine
masculine Christ consciousness

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.830 align:middle line:90%
But we are completely blinded.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Most of humanity is so wounded
that it's blinded to the--

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
can't even conceive what
a healed, whole expression

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:90%
of the divine masculine is.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is why, when the
ascended masters of the Sophia

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Dragon Tribe invited me to take
on the commission of birthing

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
the Sophia code, the
codex, they said, you

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
need to start with divine
feminine Christ consciousness.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.160 align:middle line:90%
And I said, I--

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.280 align:middle line:84%
what about the other
half of the population?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm for human consciousness.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was because
I myself needed

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
to be so reconciled with divine
feminine Christ consciousness

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
that they were showing
me the way to coming

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.570 align:middle line:84%
into the wholeness
where I could perceive

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
the beauty and the power
and the majesty of how

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
the divine masculine
and the divine feminine

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
are meant to complement each
other and lift one another up.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
We have a long way to
go with that journey,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and so what I've been focusing
on for the past three years is

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
teaching, surprisingly, both
men, women, and non-binary

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:84%
identified individuals how to
lead through divine feminine

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Christ consciousness.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.190 align:middle line:84%
That begins with a
process that we call

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:90%
embodying your higher self.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.803 align:middle line:84%
So for those of you who are
very familiar with my work

00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
and have come here
tonight, don't worry.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.053 align:middle line:84%
We'll get to the
fireworks soon, but--

00:07:08.053 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLING]

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I just want to give a background
to all of the beautiful Earth

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
angels that we have
here that aren't

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
familiar with this codex, so
thank you for your patience.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So we call that embodying
your higher self, and--

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in "The
Sophia Code," that

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:84%
is a journey of learning
how to surrender

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.160 align:middle line:84%
into your own
divinity that can then

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
begin to operate
your human awareness,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:90%
very much like a supercomputer.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.253 align:middle line:90%
You are a supercomputer.

00:07:43.253 --> 00:07:45.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
anyone in this room that

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:90%
would argue with that.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.390 align:middle line:84%
We're all pretty conscious
beings in this room.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.718 align:middle line:84%
But your higher self is the
majority of the supercomputer,

00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and your human body-- you
can think about it more

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:90%
like the hardware.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's a massive
operating system

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that can be activated
within you that we

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
call a divine genome
that interfaces

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.260 align:middle line:84%
in the sub-atomic universe
of your biological DNA.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.230 align:middle line:84%
When you activate this through
a series of initiations

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that we provide in the first
book of this codex, what

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.180 align:middle line:84%
happens is bridges
of light are being

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
built between your divine genome
and your carbon-based DNA.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And what we say is you
go on a dragon ride

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:84%
because your ego structure
starts to flip out for a while.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
And so in our year
one curriculum,

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:90%
we teach that that's OK.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.570 align:middle line:84%
You can have all your
feelings about being

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
both divine and human and
the stars that collide

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.410 align:middle line:84%
when you wake up to the
fact that that's what

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:90%
wants to integrate within you.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Your divinity wants to
operate your human awareness

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
in every area of your life
and every moment of your life.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:10%
And when that happens,
everything comes into alignment

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.300 align:middle line:10%
with the consciousness
of source energy

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:10%
that knows how to orchestrate
your life perfectly, way

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:10%
better than your human
ideas about that.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.282 align:middle line:84%
And that's never going
to change, no matter

00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
how advanced you
get on this path,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.850 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much you're
embodying your divinity.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
You'll always catch yourself
in that moment where

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
your human ideas about how
something's supposed to happen,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.496 align:middle line:84%
And then the divine
download shows up.

00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:84%
And wow, I couldn't
even plan that.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Good thing I'm surrendered
every day to the prayer that's

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:90%
praying me, right?

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
I want to get in
alignment with that.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:84%
That's more grace, more
ease, more prosperity,

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
more communion, more
connection, more success, more

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:84%
getting over myself to
get into myself, right?

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, let's do that.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Way better than fighting
against yourself,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:84%
sabotaging yourself, hating
yourself, thinking you

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:90%
are unworthy of who you are.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's the root of
so many of our issues,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.940 align:middle line:84%
of our deepest
wounding is with one

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
another, that drive to
compete, that drive to compare.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're so focused
on the outward instead

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
of really learning how to
accept how much we've already

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
been given and choosing to
radiate that and express

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that in this world as the
medicine that we need.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take a
moment to say this prayer,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
because I want to talk
about some issues,

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.680 align:middle line:84%
but I want to do that first,
through setting the space

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:90%
through this consciousness.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Prayer is simply
setting an intention,

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.650 align:middle line:10%
so you don't-- there's
no wrong way to do it.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.650 align:middle line:10%
You can close your eyes.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:46.090 align:middle line:10%
You can keep your eyes open.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:10%
It's all good.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:10%
You practice breathing.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:54.210 align:middle line:84%
Holy Mother, Holy Father,
Sophia's source of all life,

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
thank you for this
amazing opportunity

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
to gather together with
all of these amazing souls

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
that you've created in
your image and likeness

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.920 align:middle line:90%
and in nothing less than that.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
We call into your
one source light

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:84%
that exists within each
and every one of us.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And we willingly
invoke divine will

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to govern this space
for the next 90 minutes,

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.420 align:middle line:84%
the divine will that seeks to
prosper every single person

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.830 align:middle line:84%
here live and on this live
broadcast and at the replay.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.130 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit, your Holy
Spirit, your Buddhic light

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:84%
is reaching out through each of
our hearts and into our minds

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and baptizing us right
now in this moment

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:43.250 align:middle line:84%
into an even deeper remembrance
of who we really are.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So we welcome this light
that is our own light.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:90%
We share it with you.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:90%
We are you, and you are us.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And we allow this
pure, crystalline light

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of Sophia Christ consciousness
to wash through us,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to bless us, knowing that
this light comes from above us

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and is beneath us, but it also
radiates out from within us

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
so that we can bravely and
courageously look at this world

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
outside of us with
eyes to see and ears

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.670 align:middle line:84%
to hear to perceive reality
the way you perceive reality,

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Holy Mother, Holy
Father of all life.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
The way you perceive reality
is through your unconditional

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
love, through your
unconditional compassion,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and through unconditional grace,
that there is a divine plan

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:40.750 align:middle line:84%
to heal, prosper,
and reconcile all.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to be
a part of that plan,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.610 align:middle line:84%
because we all grow
brighter and stronger as we

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:84%
receive your presence
moving through us.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:90%
That is us.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:84%
We also call forth the presence
of your holy messengers,

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
the ascended masters who walk
just a little bit ahead of us

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to show us the way of what
it would look like to become

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:90%
ascended masters ourselves--

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.610 align:middle line:90%
angels in human form.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And so we welcome the
first eight key codes

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that are revealed in your
divine feminine Christ

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:90%
codex, the Sophia Code.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.550 align:middle line:84%
We welcome ascended master
Isis, she of 1,000 names.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Keycode 1.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
We welcome Keycode 2, Hathor,
she of a thousand voices

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:90%
and the Hathor star nation.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We welcome Keycode 3, Green
Tara, she of a thousand stars

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and her order of
[INAUDIBLE] angels.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
We welcome Keycode 4, Mother
Mary, she of a thousand roses

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:84%
blessing this space and
activating the space

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.630 align:middle line:84%
into the highest frequencies
of your Shekinah light.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
We welcome Keycode 5,
our overlighting mentor

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
for this evening's
workshop, Mary Magdalene,

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
she of a thousand angels.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:84%
She also arrives with
ascended master Jesus

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and the entire
order of Magdalene,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
including grandmother
Anna and Joan of Arc.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We welcome Keycode 6, Quan
Yin, she of a thousand waters

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:90%

We welcome Keycode 7, White
Buffalo Woman and the White

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Buffalo Star Nation,
some of which

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:84%
who have incarnated
into their forms

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
as an answered
prophecy at this time.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we welcome
the holy Seraphim,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:84%
the Sophia Dragons,
Keycode 777, she

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:90%
who births sovereign creators.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
We also welcome the
many orders of angels

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:90%
that are here attending to us.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.430 align:middle line:84%
We welcome all of
our guardian angels.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We welcome all of
the magical ones

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
from across this multiverse
that may have different forms

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:90%
or faces than yours.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But they too are in an
interstellar mission

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
to bring Christ consciousness
into this world and to others.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And so we welcome Keycode
999, our Star Nation Families,

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
our lineages of light, but most
importantly, Holy Mother Sophia

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:90%
God, Holy Father Sophia God.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.960 align:middle line:84%
We welcome the presence
of everyone's higher self

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:84%
descending now as waterfalls of
light through each of our crown

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:90%
chakras.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has a higher self.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got one if you've
never met your higher self.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.980 align:middle line:90%
Everyone got one.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can think about
your crown chakra as a door.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And you could start
to think about--

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:84%
or a field-- another download
of your higher self coming

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:84%
to live inside your
body like a waterfall

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:84%
of light pouring through
your crown chakra right now.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:56.661 align:middle line:84%
10, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'd also like to
invite you to ground

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:90%
to the center of the Earth.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I know there's a lot
happening with the Earth.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.353 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, lightworkers
feel a little nervous

00:16:09.353 --> 00:16:10.645 align:middle line:90%
about connecting to the planet.

00:16:10.645 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that
in the Sophia Code,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:90%
we call the Earth Sophia Gaia.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:90%
And Sophia Gaia loves you.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of
our get to mission

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:84%
as Earth angels is to stay
connected to the Earth

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much these
dark agendas want us

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
to disconnect from the Earth.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Our power comes by
staying connected, not

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:84%
all of our power, but
a part of our power

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
comes from our relationship
with the Earth.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:90%
She's very, very powerful.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.800 align:middle line:84%
So just feeling a
beautiful grounding

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
cord dropping from your root,
yeah, so much fun, right?

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.830 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the dragon ride.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Connect into that Earth.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And feel that foundation
that the Earth has never

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:90%
forsaken you.

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:84%
There's no hell
inside of her other

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
than the ones the
humans make up.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:90%
It's truly heaven.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.640 align:middle line:90%
She's truly a Christed being.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
To be able to live inside
her body with your body, wow,

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.839 align:middle line:84%
it's like you never
left the womb.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.125 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing,
the concept of it.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Everybody looks really
bright and shiny now.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And [LAUGHTER] one final thing.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.670 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to invite
everyone in the room

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:38.470 align:middle line:10%
that if everybody's come from
all different things that

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:10%
happen today, this week,
the past few months.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh my god, it's been so
intense the past few months.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Ooh.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I invite you that whatever
burdens that you've

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
come in here tonight
with, or any energies that

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
have been afflicting
you, or maybe you're

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:84%
having difficulty
with some ancestors,

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to now just
allow the ascended masters

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.650 align:middle line:84%
and the angels that surround
you to support your higher self.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can escort these
energies outside the door.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd like to pick
them back up on your way out.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.950 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking anything
away from you, I promise.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:90%
We would never do that.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
But this is what's called
a divine intervention,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:90%
a moment of grace.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you'd like to allow for
any burdens or any hardships,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:84%
anything that you've just
been really struggling

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.740 align:middle line:84%
with trying to figure
out, and there's just--

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:84%
so you might feel
like you're stuck,

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
just allow maybe one of these
ascended masters or a guardian

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
angel to take that individual
or that issue by the hand

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and say, come on, dear.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:90%
Come on outside.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's let her/him just have
a moment to themselves here.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you get to have this
moment all to yourself.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.900 align:middle line:90%
You deserve it.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are starving
for a time with source

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:90%
because we're so busy.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
This is your time
here in this workshop.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And my prayer is that by
the end of this workshop,

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:84%
you will feel deeply regenerated
and at peace with how

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:90%
magnificent you really are.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for
taking a moment to step

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.170 align:middle line:84%
into the space of prayer
together, set the fields,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
set our intention
to deeply receive

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:26.490 align:middle line:84%
a much larger remembrance
of who we are.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:35.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Everyone feel a little better?

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, good.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Feeling good is it's like
some kind of victorious feat

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.590 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHTER] I mean,
we are just slammed

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
with so many responsibilities,
so many commitments.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:84%
Our world is moving
at hyperspeed.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And it can feel so overwhelming
when we don't connect

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:90%
with other Earth angels.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
thank you again

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:84%
for taking this
time to be in a room

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:84%
with so many people that care
this much about the Earth's

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:20.130 align:middle line:84%
future and humanity's
future as you do.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So often in our lives,
we navigate the field

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.100 align:middle line:84%
of so many people that just,
they're either completely

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
asleep, they've
either-- or they've

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
been zombified by the
system, and they don't even

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.180 align:middle line:84%
know how to get their
way out of a paper bag,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:90%
god bless their souls.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
But they really are that wounded
and toxified that sometimes it

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
feels like just going
to the grocery store

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
is like walking
through a minefield.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like your daily
practice becomes

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:84%
how to pray in traffic,
how to get through the post

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.390 align:middle line:90%
office in a good way.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Where you're able
to bless that person

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
instead of curse them
out in your head.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like may that be my prayer.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a
very complex world.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found personally
is that understanding who I am

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
has alleviated a lot
of that burden of being

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in a world that feels so
foreign and unfamiliar to me.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.780 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
When you understand how
important and special you are--

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and that doesn't mean that
you're tripping on your ego.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.285 align:middle line:84%
And you think you're more
special than anybody else.

00:21:35.285 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
It just means that
you're finally

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.480 align:middle line:90%
accepting how special you are.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:46.200 align:middle line:84%
When you allow that knowingness
to begin to nourish your heart,

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.250 align:middle line:84%
it brings great purpose
to the post office,

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and the praying in traffic, and
the raising of our children,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and any act of
kindness and generosity

00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that we're willing to
embody in a courageous way

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:84%
when the world would have you
just behave like everyone else

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:84%
because that's
what's safer to do.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is
that we no longer

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:84%
have the luxury of not
stepping into our higher self

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:90%
embodiment and our leadership.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.670 align:middle line:90%
I love you all so very much.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Bless their hearts.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I have people that
come up to me.

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm retired now.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So good job, honey,
for leading the cause.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just like,
we're not going

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to have a planet here for you
to retire to if we're not all

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:90%
leading together.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Like we are really
at that moment.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where you're
getting your news sources from,

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.490 align:middle line:84%
it's a really big deal,
this moment that we're

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:90%
standing at right now.

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
Half of the world's
species are extinct.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
The ecosystem is
potentially about

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:90%
to collapse from geoengineering.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
We have a full-blown child
rape trafficking situation

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.220 align:middle line:84%
worldwide that most of our
governments are controlled by.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Most of our food
and water is poison.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:90%
The world's covered in plastic.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
filled with toxins

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.440 align:middle line:90%
and do not know how to cleanse.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:84%
They do not know how to allow
their bodies to rejuvenate

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.290 align:middle line:84%
themselves so that
they can actually feel

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:90%
their connection to the divine.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Why would our connection to
the divine be so important?

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
It's because that's,
number one, the healing

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.740 align:middle line:90%
solution to all suffering.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
source of regeneration

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:90%
in a world that's on the brink.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a pivotal
moment where we've all

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.490 align:middle line:84%
got to understand that none
of us can rest on our laurels,

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:56.000 align:middle line:84%
no matter how much we
have led in the past.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
The only way we create and
birth a new reality that

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.280 align:middle line:84%
moves us beyond this
very pivotal moment

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:90%
is if we do it together.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.582 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer
the age of the guru.

00:24:07.582 --> 00:24:09.040 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to
be anybody's guru.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.300 align:middle line:90%
You can ask anybody on my team.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:90%
The thought makes me sick.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:90%
We're here to do this together.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
We're here to lead side
by side, wing to wing.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.050 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit
about how I feel about that.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.704 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:29.704 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I've spent most of
my life committed

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.840 align:middle line:84%
to activating as many human
beings as I possibly can.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And my prayer is that
everyone in this room,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:45.240 align:middle line:84%
and everyone that your heart
touches, is going to either--

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.930 align:middle line:84%
you're either on that
journey yourself,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.310 align:middle line:84%
or you're considering the steps
to take to be on that journey

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and to be a part
of the solution.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:25:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So as I mentioned earlier,
I lived a microcosm

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.990 align:middle line:84%
of what's happening in the
macrocosm here on this planet.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to go
into the details of that.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:10.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually currently
writing my next book

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
where I will share
the full story of what

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I survived not because I want
to tell that story, necessarily.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather leave it in
the past where it is.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
But there are, quite frankly,
millions upon millions of souls

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that don't even know
that they've suffered

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:90%
from similar atrocities.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And whether a soul has
physically experienced

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
these atrocities or not,
rape and annihilation

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and genocide consciousness is
affecting every single human

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.000 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So this book is going to
be a conversation about how

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.850 align:middle line:84%
do we reconcile with
ourselves in a world that's

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.480 align:middle line:84%
being torn apart by
this consciousness

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:84%
through the reconciliation
with our own higher self,

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:01.600 align:middle line:84%
our own higher self
sovereign divinity.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because when you step into the
remembrance and the embodiment

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:84%
of your sovereign divinity,
that consciousness that you are

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
will guide you to every
healing empowerment.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It will guide you to everything
that you could possibly

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
need to heal your life from the
wounding of that energy that's

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
frankly controlling this planet.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.040 align:middle line:90%
So it's an inside job, right?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The liberation of this
world is an inside job.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:84%
It can only happen
one heart at a time.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, we gotta get
those hearts moving.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We got to get a lot of
hearts on that journey

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible
if we want a planet here

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.330 align:middle line:84%
for our children and our
grandchildren that doesn't look

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.480 align:middle line:84%
like some robotic
AI-driven where we

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.300 align:middle line:90%
eat metal instead of real food.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And we're breathing out
of bags instead of outside

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.860 align:middle line:84%
because there's just nothing
left to breathe anymore.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.410 align:middle line:10%
If you don't think that's
where we're headed right now,

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:11.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, but you're not
reading reliable sources

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:10%
of news or looking
deeper into what's being

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.680 align:middle line:10%
told in the mainstream media.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.620 align:middle line:90%
We're at a pivotal moment.

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So the good news that
the Sophia Dragon

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Tribe as a ascended Master
High Council offers us

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.590 align:middle line:84%
is that there are light
bodies from your higher self

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that interface with your
human body that can protect,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.360 align:middle line:84%
regenerate, and nourish
you throughout this very

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.570 align:middle line:84%
pivotal, polarized
moment in human history

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
where the toxicity levels on
this planet are out of control

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.220 align:middle line:84%
both emotionally,
psychically, and physically.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:55.120 align:middle line:10%
You have to start resourcing
the technology of your own body,

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:10%
the technology of
your own higher self,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:10%
the technology of
your own sovereignty

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.150 align:middle line:10%
and your own divinity.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So far, this current
paradigm is based on slavery.

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Would you not agree?

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:11.700 align:middle line:90%
So what is the healing to that?

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.980 align:middle line:90%
It starts with S, right?

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.063 align:middle line:90%
Sovereignty.

00:28:16.063 --> 00:28:17.730 align:middle line:84%
I just get chills
through my whole body.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.850 align:middle line:90%
That's the healing.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:84%
That's what all of
the distractions

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.870 align:middle line:84%
are designed to keep
you from remembering,

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.350 align:middle line:90%
how sovereign and free you are.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.252 align:middle line:90%
Sounds cool, OK?

00:28:32.252 --> 00:28:34.275 align:middle line:90%
Hey, I'm sovereign and divine.

00:28:34.275 --> 00:28:38.295 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] I'm nobody's slave.

00:28:38.295 --> 00:28:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like the
extraordinary good news.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But it's only the
good news if you

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.530 align:middle line:90%
do something awesome with it.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Power is simply power.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It can be used for either
good or bad, right?

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:90%
Machiavelli taught us that.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Your sovereign divinity
comes with another X factor

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.550 align:middle line:90%
called free will.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
What a bag of monkeys
that is, right?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.810 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
But could you ever
really, truly know

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:18.890 align:middle line:84%
how unconditionally loved you
are unless you had free will?

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
If you were only designed to
be some sort of robot that just

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.762 align:middle line:84%
followed divine will without the
ability to turn away from it,

00:29:27.762 --> 00:29:30.095 align:middle line:84%
would you really know if you
were unconditionally loved?

00:29:30.095 --> 00:29:33.530 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So therein lies the crux of our
very pivotal moment that we're

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:90%
living as human beings.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
We are deciding by choosing
to activate our divine genome

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:49.320 align:middle line:90%
because here we are in crisis.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.930 align:middle line:84%
We no longer have the luxury
of I'll do that next lifetime.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Will there be that
lifetime on this planet?

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:90%
No, it's this lifetime.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.240 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:90%
It's got to happen now.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.460 align:middle line:84%
All of us came to make sure
it would happen right now.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:90%


00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But do you see how free will
makes us really lazy sometimes?

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Like we can hang out for a
long time and not do anything

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that we're really
supposed to do, right?

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So we've all, funny enough,
our addiction to crisis,

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:84%
to evolve through crisis,
is what has gotten us

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to a massive global crisis.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So in the Sophia Code, which is
a modern Mystery School where

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
you mentor directly with
the ascended masters, what

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:47.570 align:middle line:84%
we discover is that we got to
get super real about our ego

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:90%
structures.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.170 align:middle line:90%
We got to get--

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and not about killing
our ego structures.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We got to learn how
to integrate our ego

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.680 align:middle line:84%
structures with our higher self
because the higher self knows

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.848 align:middle line:90%
how to soothe the ego structure.

00:30:59.848 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
We're not getting rid
of the ego structure.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Ego structure comes
with your human body.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.850 align:middle line:84%
It has a certain purpose
to keep you alive,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.250 align:middle line:90%
make sure you stay fed.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.910 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not
a problem when it's

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.010 align:middle line:84%
integrated with your
higher self's divinity.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.550 align:middle line:90%


00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about making a
part of the fabric of who

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.840 align:middle line:90%
you are wrong.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about being willing
to do the inner work

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:32.203 align:middle line:84%
to accept the totality of you,
which most of you is divine.

00:31:32.203 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And actually, your
humanity as divine as well.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a manifestation
of your divinity.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So in that journey--
again, sounds cool.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
But when you put your
foot upon the path

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of walking the way with
these ascended masters,

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
so much flares up from past
life wounding, present life

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.910 align:middle line:84%
wounding, karmic oaths
and vows that you

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.160 align:middle line:90%
may have taken, frustration.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a lot of
patience in our society

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.770 align:middle line:84%
for the evolutionary
process, for

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
the real, authentic
inner journey that

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.560 align:middle line:84%
is required to
upgrade your systems

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.895 align:middle line:84%
and live through the integration
process of the upgrades.

00:32:12.895 --> 00:32:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody wants to
upgrade in the activation.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
integration cycles.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Then there's periods of
rest, acceptance, compassion

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.980 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It's a journey.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And there's no destination.

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:30.100 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people, they're
just shopping around

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
for spirituality, do
not want to hear that.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I've
had the great honor

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
of working with initiates
all over the world that

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:90%
do want to hear that.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
They want to take this
journey within themselves

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.190 align:middle line:84%
because they know there's
no way out but through.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And what's exciting
is that when we

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:84%
choose to do this journey of
spiritual awakening together,

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.690 align:middle line:90%
everything becomes easier.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have an
ever-growing, collective

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:84%
consciousness doing
this work together,

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.990 align:middle line:84%
quantum leaps can
start happening.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.220 align:middle line:84%
Residual karmic challenges that
might have been insurmountable

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.740 align:middle line:84%
for you five years
ago might be actually

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
something you can start
approaching, maybe

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.280 align:middle line:84%
this year, because 10,000
other people decided

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to do their inner
work five years ago.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.940 align:middle line:90%
That's called love.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a moment and
bring our hands to our hearts

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.300 align:middle line:84%
because I can't imagine there's
a single person in this room

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.790 align:middle line:84%
that hasn't overcome
something really big

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.220 align:middle line:90%
over the past five years.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that's
true about yourself?

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:40.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, like major, right?

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, so just take a minute
and close your eyes,

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:52.470 align:middle line:84%
bowing your head to your
heart, and just say thank you.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.100 align:middle line:84%
You can say it out
loud or silently.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.290 align:middle line:90%
I love you.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being an Earth
angel to so many other humans.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.760 align:middle line:90%
You led the way.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.710 align:middle line:90%
You, heart.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.150 align:middle line:84%
You were brave
enough to heal what

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.679 align:middle line:90%
so many people refuse to heal.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.839 align:middle line:84%
But now they're thinking about
healing it because I healed it,

00:34:19.839 --> 00:34:20.639 align:middle line:90%
we healed it.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.897 align:middle line:90%


00:34:23.897 --> 00:34:25.230 align:middle line:90%
You're a really big deal, heart.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.739 align:middle line:84%
And just feeling how much
your heart loves to hear

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:39.330 align:middle line:90%
about how courageous you are.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.545 align:middle line:84%
I really want to hear everyone
say out loud, I love you.

00:34:42.545 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:44.995 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

00:34:44.995 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:46.927 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you, heart.

00:34:46.927 --> 00:34:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I love you, heart.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.816 align:middle line:90%
>> You are the bravest heart.

00:34:49.816 --> 00:34:51.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You are the bravest heart.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I have ever met.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:53.629 align:middle line:90%
>> I have ever met.

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:54.429 align:middle line:90%
[BABY CRYING]

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.699 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll scream it to the sky.

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:56.274 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.274 --> 00:34:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll scream it to the sky.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.560 align:middle line:90%
>> What a brave heart you are.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What a brave heart you are.

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:02.018 align:middle line:90%
>> That baby knows what's up.

00:35:02.018 --> 00:35:06.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] Bless you, baby.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:13.860 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so did that feel good?

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a good start to
a workshop, right?

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Loving yourself?

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
root of everything.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of where
everything starts.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Anything worth doing,
anything worth having.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So in the journey
of what I survived,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I was born into a
military program,

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:42.540 align:middle line:84%
multiple military
programs actually.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And I died multiple times.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:10%
And every time that I died,
from what I experienced,

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.900 align:middle line:10%
from the brutality, the
atrocities that I witnessed,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I was taken to the Higher Realms
by these beautiful ascended

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:05.510 align:middle line:10%
masters and these angels, my
higher self, my star family.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.840 align:middle line:84%
That might be a weird
term for some people,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:84%
but for some people in
this room, not so weird.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.010 align:middle line:90%
We are at CLE.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And because this
happened for 18 years,

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.720 align:middle line:84%
I learned so much about
the other side of--

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:84%
I learned so much
about our multiverse.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't even live
in a universe.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.840 align:middle line:90%
We live in a multiverse.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And there are countless
species of beings

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that are just as
intelligent as we are,

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.270 align:middle line:84%
if not a whole lot more, that
are out there that are actively

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.390 align:middle line:84%
working for the
ascension of all beings

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.040 align:middle line:84%
not just humanity
or this planet.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We get so hyperfocused on our
own species and our own planet

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.148 align:middle line:84%
because we're a
little self-centered.

00:36:56.148 --> 00:36:57.615 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The truth is is
that there are so

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.290 align:middle line:84%
many planets and star systems
and beautiful beings in form

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and outside of form that
are-- that deeply care

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:90%
about this multiverse.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's the other spectrum
too just like on Earth.

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:84%
There's people that
you love to be around.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And there's people, like
I love you from over here,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.380 align:middle line:90%
sending you love from over here.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Boundaries.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And so in that journey, it
was these incredibly high

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:39.240 align:middle line:84%
vibrational beings that
would help me repair my soul

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and would also give me
ascension blueprints

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and access to incredible
amount of realms,

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.070 align:middle line:84%
incredible amount of
places in the multiverse

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that I feel very blessed and
honored that I got to witness

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.670 align:middle line:90%
and learn from.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And every time I came
back, I was coming back

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:90%
with more and more information.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand
what as I was

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.220 align:middle line:84%
surviving what I was surviving
how much I was bringing back.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:84%
It was all being sort
of stored like files

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.660 align:middle line:90%
in the back of my consciousness.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:10.170 align:middle line:84%
But as I began to work
on the Sophia Code,

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I began to really understand
what I had survived

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:17.985 align:middle line:84%
and what was given to me as
a gift from what I survived.

00:38:17.985 --> 00:38:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It became very evident
to me the purpose

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.065 align:middle line:84%
of why I had to go through
what I had to go through.

00:38:28.065 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
I am sharing that

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.790 align:middle line:84%
is because one of my
most favorite things

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.640 align:middle line:84%
was being able to
see these angels

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and being able to see
these masters of light.

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But when I would come
back, what I would also see

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:50.130 align:middle line:84%
was that there were humans,
not in my personal reality,

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:52.170 align:middle line:84%
but there were humans
out there that I

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.850 align:middle line:84%
would see from a distance that
I could see angel wings coming

00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.913 align:middle line:90%
out of their back.

00:38:58.913 --> 00:39:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And there would
be moments where I

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.940 align:middle line:84%
would be helping other
children in the same situation

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.515 align:middle line:90%
that I was in.

00:39:04.515 --> 00:39:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
I would psychically

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.480 align:middle line:90%
see angel wings on my back.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And then there would be
these angelic healings

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.287 align:middle line:84%
that would come through
me for these children that

00:39:14.287 --> 00:39:16.620 align:middle line:84%
were surviving what I was
surviving because I was trying

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.070 align:middle line:90%
to save them as well.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.710 align:middle line:84%
And I never talked
about this out loud.

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It never occurred to me
other people might see this

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.420 align:middle line:84%
or that it was something to
talk about because you just

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.670 align:middle line:84%
didn't talk about any
of this where I was

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:90%
and what I was surviving.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But I stored that
information for later.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And a year and a half ago, we
did a really beautiful retreat

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.350 align:middle line:84%
at this gorgeous location
in Malibu, California.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.480 align:middle line:90%
And on our way there--

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.600 align:middle line:90%
we were driving there--

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.220 align:middle line:90%
Mother Mary came to me.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And she had never
talked to me, spoken

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:90%
to me, with such an intensity.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.930 align:middle line:84%
She said, you've got to
really wake up your initiates.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:08.950 align:middle line:84%
You've got to really
give it to them straight.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Like you can't sugar coat
this thing anymore for them.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.795 align:middle line:90%
Like they're activated enough.

00:40:13.795 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
They've learned enough
about the codex.

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:17.940 align:middle line:84%
You really need to talk to
them about what's happening

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.546 align:middle line:90%
on this planet right now.

00:40:20.546 --> 00:40:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And I went, this is a
little intense, Mary.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.110 align:middle line:84%
Like wanna reel it
in a little bit?

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Like all these people just
paid a lot of money to see me.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Like I don't want
to freak people out.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And she's like, no, you really--

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.410 align:middle line:84%
you've really got to be clear
that there are times coming,

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.398 align:middle line:84%
and for the next few years, that
are going to be really dark.

00:40:39.398 --> 00:40:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And people are really
going to need to know

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.950 align:middle line:90%
how to access their light.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not a luxury anymore.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.090 align:middle line:90%
It's like a have to.

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's also a get to.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's a have to if you want
to stay sane in this game.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.400 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this world is literally
on fire or being iced.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it's
not good for anyone,

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:84%
including for the
ones who are doing it.

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Let's be honest.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Talk about insanity, right?

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.880 align:middle line:90%
So excuse me.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.150 align:middle line:90%
So I go to this conference.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time-- and
it was actually, Joan of Arc

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:90%
came as well.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.820 align:middle line:84%
And she also-- that's when
I knew, whoa, this is--

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I knew Mother Mary was fierce.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.490 align:middle line:84%
But when Joan of Arc came
side by side with her,

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.470 align:middle line:84%
I was like, wow, this
is a whole other level

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that they're asking me to bring
this message into the world.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And that location
doesn't exist anymore

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:43.260 align:middle line:84%
because it was burned down in
the Malibu fires last year.

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:44.310 align:middle line:90%
So if that isn't--

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:51.380 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't speak to
what Mother Mary was

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:84%
speaking about only
several years ago,

00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:58.833 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what does.

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So much of what's happening
right now on this planet

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.460 align:middle line:90%
is not natural.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.290 align:middle line:90%
And we're not at the end of it.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:08.740 align:middle line:84%
We still have a ways to
go before we come clear

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:11.530 align:middle line:84%
of these dark agendas and
really birth the new paradigm

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.840 align:middle line:90%
that we all came here to birth.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.700 align:middle line:90%
So it got me thinking.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Got me thinking about
these angel wings.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It got me thinking about what is
it going to take to get humans

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:90%
into the get to of our mission.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Because every day, it feels
really daunting, does it not?

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:90%
The world is changing so fast.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:37.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a lot
to take in every day.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.710 align:middle line:84%
But the only way to stay
sane and in the game

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:45.890 align:middle line:84%
is by dialing into
your divinity every day

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and looking at this world
as the get to opportunity

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:90%
of your own angelic mission.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.460 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Now if you're a real angel,
like a real live angel, who

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:08.020 align:middle line:84%
doesn't love an
angel in human form,

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.900 align:middle line:84%
would the mission
seem as daunting?

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we believe that angels
can do anything, don't we?

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:17.770 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:18.610 align:middle line:90%
Connecting the dots.

00:43:18.610 --> 00:43:21.200 align:middle line:90%


00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I realized what
Mother Mary and Joan of Arc

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:29.860 align:middle line:84%
and Mary Magdalene were
guiding me towards especially.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.850 align:middle line:84%
They came back at the
same time last year.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And they said, you need to
start talking about wings up.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:42.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to start talking to
lightworkers that are truly

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:49.000 align:middle line:84%
living angels on Earth as
many of our living angels

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.360 align:middle line:84%
must be activated and in the
remembrance of who they really

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.050 align:middle line:84%
are so that we
have a chance here,

00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:00.010 align:middle line:84%
a really good chance to create
the world that we really want

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and that we really believe
in, which is the heaven

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:03.400 align:middle line:90%
inside of our heart.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows that
there-- does everyone

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.660 align:middle line:84%
know that there's a heavenly
reality inside of you?

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.470 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, that's OK.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:11.470 align:middle line:84%
But can we have a show
of hands of people who've

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:15.400 align:middle line:84%
experienced a feeling
that there is something

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.040 align:middle line:90%
so divine and heavenly?

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't be in
your heart if it wasn't

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.910 align:middle line:90%
meant to come out of you.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:26.770 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:28.700 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't have access to it.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And for those of you who are
like, I've never felt that.

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.050 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.660 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean it's not there.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It took me years to feel heaven
inside of me, literally years.

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.890 align:middle line:84%
It was because of
the Sophia Code

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.990 align:middle line:84%
that I finally felt
it after everything

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.660 align:middle line:90%
I had gone through, OK?

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's no right
or wrong here.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just exploring
the potential

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.880 align:middle line:84%
of what we already have
whether we can feel it or not.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So angels know
about heaven, right?

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's where
they're from funny enough.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.850 align:middle line:90%
So you're just the person.

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:84%
You're just the human
being for this job.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.290 align:middle line:90%
But I'll tell you what.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're not using your
wings, it feels a lot heavier,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.950 align:middle line:90%
does it not?

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Do feathers and
wings make everything

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.270 align:middle line:90%
lighter and more mobile?

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It's true right?

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:84%
If you hold a single
feather in your hand,

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:27.130 align:middle line:84%
you feel the lightness of
that feather physically

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.960 align:middle line:90%
and energetically.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to do an
activation of your angel wings

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.000 align:middle line:90%
tonight.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Would you like that?

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:36.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:41.380 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER] And how fantastic.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.430 align:middle line:90%
So glad we're on the same page.

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And so for those who are
initiates of the Sophia Code

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Modern Mystery school,
I want to thank you

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:84%
for all of your incredible hard
work, your spiritual maturity,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.940 align:middle line:84%
your presence, all of the ways
that you've been preparing

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.440 align:middle line:90%
the way for this moment.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to create space
for all of our Earth angels

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:84%
here that are ready
to unfurl their wings.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a special LA
blinging upgrade for your wings

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:09.820 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.330 align:middle line:90%
So fear not.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.350 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Because angels like
to be beautiful.

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
That's a divine
feminine principle.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The beauty way is
the invitation.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:31.030 align:middle line:84%
When we look upon beauty,
it's an invitation to grace.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.070 align:middle line:90%
It's not about comparison.

00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:36.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not about fitting some
weird plastic patriarchal

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.420 align:middle line:90%
molding.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.120 align:middle line:10%
We all know when something
is a beautiful invitation

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:10%
to the sacred.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's what your wings are.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:47.350 align:middle line:10%
And they deserve to
be honored as such.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.690 align:middle line:90%
So great.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
your legs crossed,

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.540 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with it.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.580 align:middle line:84%
But you probably want to
connect more to the Earth

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.622 align:middle line:90%
through your feet chakra.

00:46:55.622 --> 00:47:00.150 align:middle line:90%


00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And you could have your
hands open so that they're

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.650 align:middle line:90%
in a receptive space.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:16.294 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.294 --> 00:47:17.095 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And I welcome the presence
of Mary Magdalene,

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:37.403 align:middle line:84%
she of a thousand angels, to
come and be with you right now.

00:47:37.403 --> 00:47:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Now what's so fascinating
about the ascended masters

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.550 align:middle line:90%
is they're so multidimensional.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene can be behind
every single one of us

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.340 align:middle line:90%
equally at the same time.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.250 align:middle line:84%
No one has to fight
for Mary's attention.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.120 align:middle line:90%
She's all yours.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And she's a knockout.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.460 align:middle line:90%
She is stunning.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.540 align:middle line:84%
She's the supermodel of
the ascended master world.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And she wants you to feel just
as fabulous about yourself

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:11.250 align:middle line:90%
as she feels about herself.

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:15.700 align:middle line:84%
That's how much she
cares about you.

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, good.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.760 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
that we're going

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:25.110 align:middle line:84%
to invite Mary Magdalene to
be presenced with us here with

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.700 align:middle line:90%
is the issue of unworthiness.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Angels, did you know
that some of the most

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:33.930 align:middle line:84%
gifted, talented,
genius Earth angels

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.980 align:middle line:84%
have the lowest opinions about
themselves and their talents?

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:90%
I see some head nodding.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It's taken me a lifetime
to rebuild my self-esteem,

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.910 align:middle line:90%
my sense of self-worth.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It's totally natural.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:55.880 align:middle line:84%
So Mary Magdalene is placing
her hands on your shoulders.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And for those
individuals who would

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.990 align:middle line:84%
like to work with Jesus, her
divine masculine counterpart,

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:02.940 align:middle line:84%
you're welcome to
bring in Jesus to be

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:90%
a part of this healing with you.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:06.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no right or wrong here.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It's about what works for you
and your direct connection

00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:12.600 align:middle line:84%
with your source,
with your higher self,

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.558 align:middle line:90%
and with these mentors.

00:49:13.558 --> 00:49:16.310 align:middle line:90%


00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Good, I can already
feel the energy running.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:90%
So you may begin to feel--

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't feel, that's
OK, it's still happening,

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.730 align:middle line:84%
I can see it, I
can promise you--

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:33.410 align:middle line:84%
feeling the pressure of these
lovely hands of Mary Magdalene

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:39.030 align:middle line:84%
or Jesus upon your shoulders
and just softening.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing you have
to do to prove your worth

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.550 align:middle line:90%
to receive this blessing.

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.750 align:middle line:90%
It's already given.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.340 align:middle line:84%
It's already here for you
like a gift on Christmas

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:54.212 align:middle line:84%
morning all wrapped up with a
bow just because you're you.

00:49:54.212 --> 00:49:56.990 align:middle line:90%


00:49:56.990 --> 00:50:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And so you're invited by
Mary Magdalene and Jesus

00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:08.540 align:middle line:84%
to begin to feel memories,
words, any trauma, that

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.170 align:middle line:84%
has taught you that you are
not worthy of your wings,

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that you're not worthy
of your intuition,

00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:20.730 align:middle line:84%
your intuitive gifts, what you
can see, what you can hear.

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:24.000 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you have special
manifestation skills

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.820 align:middle line:84%
that set you apart
because you are connected

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.135 align:middle line:84%
to the angelic orders,
and you are an angel,

00:50:29.135 --> 00:50:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and your life seems to go
a little bit than others,

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and people get jealous of you,
and then you try to hide that.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.360 align:middle line:90%
I see some smiles.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can give that up
too because divine will is

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:84%
for all to prosper
not just one but all.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So if you're prospering in
your gifts and your talents,

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and yes, the blessings of
your physical life that

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.710 align:middle line:84%
are an outpouring
of your inner life,

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:57.548 align:middle line:84%
you're changing the
world with the goodness

00:50:57.548 --> 00:50:58.590 align:middle line:90%
that you're experiencing.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.560 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not about suffering
for suffering people.

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about thriving
for suffering people.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.210 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.060 align:middle line:84%
How are they going to know
what not suffering looks

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:15.520 align:middle line:84%
like if you're busy
suffering alongside them?

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.320 align:middle line:90%
What a drag.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.810 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wins.

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So part of the
worthiness healing

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:26.250 align:middle line:84%
is being willing to be
blessed with success, blessed

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.030 align:middle line:84%
with divine communion, blessed
with your gifts to truly accept

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.120 align:middle line:84%
who you are for the benefit
and liberation of all beings.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:38.880 align:middle line:84%
You can't get small
enough for small people

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:42.010 align:middle line:90%
to feel big about themselves.

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things I'm
hearing from Mary Magdalene

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:50.160 align:middle line:90%
is stop hating yourself, right?

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Stop the addictions
that sabotage yourself

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.560 align:middle line:90%
as an Earth angel.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Stop the self-hatred.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And it can be very subtle.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.490 align:middle line:84%
Oh, what does that lady
in the red dress mean?

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:03.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't hate myself.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.910 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.280 align:middle line:84%
We can hate ourselves
and sabotage ourselves

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.530 align:middle line:90%
in very, very subtle ways.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Ego structure is a
super sneaky monkey.

00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Don't let that monkey
steal your joy.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:20.588 align:middle line:84%
Give it up to your higher self
right now all the secret ways.

00:52:20.588 --> 00:52:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You might not be able
to look in the mirror

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and say that you
don't love yourself

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:26.100 align:middle line:84%
or you don't accept
yourself or you're not

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.520 align:middle line:90%
good enough or worthy enough.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And there's columns of light
that Mary Magdalene and Jesus

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:35.760 align:middle line:84%
are activating around
each and every individual.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to feel
those memories of trauma,

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:42.480 align:middle line:84%
those statements maybe from
your parents or your neighbors

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.780 align:middle line:84%
or teachers or
people, co-workers,

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.320 align:middle line:84%
maybe even doctors I'm hearing,
words that doctors might have

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.850 align:middle line:84%
said to you that were harmful,
someone who thought they were

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:57.180 align:middle line:84%
in a position of power
that knew who you were--

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.220 align:middle line:84%
who they thought they
knew who you were.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.405 align:middle line:84%
But they were testing you to see
if you know who you are, angel.

00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:06.420 align:middle line:90%


00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And just feel that
weight being lifted right

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.100 align:middle line:90%
off your shoulders.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Magdalene
is filling your body

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:21.340 align:middle line:90%
with this golden ray of wisdom.

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It's because when we
give up the past traumas,

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:31.850 align:middle line:84%
we have space within ourself
to receive the wisdom

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:33.320 align:middle line:90%
of those experiences.

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:37.243 align:middle line:84%
We've all learned
from our suffering.

00:53:37.243 --> 00:53:38.660 align:middle line:84%
We've all learned
from our wounds.

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:41.390 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Receive the wisdom.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.040 align:middle line:90%
The angelic ray is a golden ray.

00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Receive the blessing
of this angelic ray,

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.140 align:middle line:84%
this golden angelic ray,
filling up the places

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.500 align:middle line:90%
that are releasing right now.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:57.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to leave a
space that's released empty.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You want to fill it up with
more of your own angelic light.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.490 align:middle line:90%


00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
You may begin to feel every
cell of your body drinking

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.660 align:middle line:84%
in that transmission from Mary
Magdalene, her golden ray.

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Like it's a straw, every
cell in your body has a straw

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:90%
and it's [SLURPING].

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.000 align:middle line:90%
Yummy.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.640 align:middle line:90%
More of you for you.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Way better than the other thing.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In India, there's this
tradition that when

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.240 align:middle line:84%
enlightened people
go into samadhi,

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're drinking this
golden nectar of ambrosia

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:42.190 align:middle line:90%
down their throat.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.420 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking
their own divinity.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.220 align:middle line:90%
And you can too.

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.392 align:middle line:84%
No reason to put anybody
on a pedestal anymore.

00:54:54.392 --> 00:54:56.475 align:middle line:84%
If anything, please put
yourself on that pedestal.

00:54:56.475 --> 00:54:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, right?

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.620 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.010 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:09.800 align:middle line:90%
So I invite you to--

00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, now that's what
we're going to do.

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:14.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, Jesus and Mary Magdalene
and all the ascended masters

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.850 align:middle line:84%
would now invite you if
you've experienced abuse,

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.150 align:middle line:84%
whether it's
psychological, emotional,

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:24.530 align:middle line:84%
whether from this lifetime
or other lifetimes,

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.570 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to
understand what's happening.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Many of you have chains or
some sort of obstruction

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.740 align:middle line:90%
covering your wings.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.480 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.958 align:middle line:90%
Would you like that to go now?

00:55:34.958 --> 00:55:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Would you like your
wings to come out

00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:40.220 align:middle line:84%
like a butterfly
out of a cocoon?

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I'd like to
remind you that you

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:45.050 align:middle line:84%
don't have to judge
yourself for any ways

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.300 align:middle line:84%
that your wings may
have been hiding.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.270 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, that was
the safest thing to do.

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.970 align:middle line:90%
For you, that was your reality.

00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:54.800 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
these times that we're

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:57.260 align:middle line:84%
living in it's no longer
safe to hide your light.

00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you understand?

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that protects
you during these times

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:04.880 align:middle line:84%
of such extreme darkness
is to own and claim

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and embody your light
like a rock star, OK?

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the prayer.

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Be in the spotlight
of your own divinity.

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And nothing can touch you
in that vibrational reality.

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:21.620 align:middle line:90%
No mind control program.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Toxins flee.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Negative entities
and beings can't take

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.500 align:middle line:90%
a hold of you or hook into you.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.570 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:31.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's the game plan.

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We've created a global
crisis to force our hand

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.720 align:middle line:90%
to our own spiritual awakening.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you disengage
with the need

00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:45.110 align:middle line:84%
to have this level
of an inspiration

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to spiritually
awaken, and you just

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:49.010 align:middle line:84%
choose to get on the
path of being the angel

00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that you came here to
be, you're no longer

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:54.240 align:middle line:84%
engaging with that system
to spiritually wake you up.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:57.380 align:middle line:90%
So beautiful.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:00.920 align:middle line:84%
So what I invite you to do
is to allow Jesus and Mary

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene-- great, I'm
already seeing it happen--

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.990 align:middle line:84%
begin to lift up in those
columns of light that

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:10.250 align:middle line:84%
are surrounding you any
chains, karmic obstructions.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:13.910 align:middle line:84%
You may feel like things are
being peeled off your back

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and going up to the light.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
control the process.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.430 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to do anything.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:23.494 align:middle line:84%
You can just receive the
divine intervention of grace.

00:57:23.494 --> 00:57:26.350 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:30.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm also seeing the violet
flame purifying this room.

00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The ascended master St. Germain
with Isis assisting you,

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.180 align:middle line:90%
beautiful winged Isis is here.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you would like
to receive this healing

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.430 align:middle line:84%
for your angel wings not
just for this lifetime

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.910 align:middle line:84%
but for all of your parallel
lifetimes happening right now,

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:49.832 align:middle line:90%
please say yes.

00:57:49.832 --> 00:57:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:55.420 align:middle line:84%
You are connected to
all of the lifetimes

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.340 align:middle line:84%
you have ever lived through
the electrons of your body.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:02.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a Hathor teaching
from the Sophia Code.

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So we send that healing
out upon the electrons

00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:08.260 align:middle line:84%
within your physical
body to all of the bodies

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:09.880 align:middle line:90%
that you've ever walked in.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.200 align:middle line:90%
And they're not all human.

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.850 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:16.030 align:middle line:90%
So enjoy the view.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the movie of you.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:21.190 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, everybody's
getting all shiny up.

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:26.910 align:middle line:90%
All right, angels.

00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.180 align:middle line:84%
We also need to upgrade
some neurological systems.

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.380 align:middle line:90%
Are we OK with that?

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I'm welcoming Green
Tara and Isis joining Mary

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene in this activation.

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So you may feel the
presence of one or more

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.360 align:middle line:84%
of them surrounding
you at this time.

00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.630 align:middle line:84%
I invite you through
your inner eyes

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.180 align:middle line:84%
to visualize the neurology
in your body, all

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:52.040 align:middle line:90%
those little neurons.

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:55.000 align:middle line:90%
What do they create within you?

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.210 align:middle line:90%
A tree of life.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.220 align:middle line:90%
That spinal cord is the trunk.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:06.040 align:middle line:84%
All of those branches branching
out through your body,

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.770 align:middle line:84%
that's the superhighway
for your higher

00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.200 align:middle line:90%
self animating your human form.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's important because
there's a war going on

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.360 align:middle line:90%
for that neurological system.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.580 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They want to plug
right into that.

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:23.470 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:28.660 align:middle line:84%
What they're trying to
simulate is their own agenda

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of source consciousness.

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But you already have
a direct connection

00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:33.930 align:middle line:90%
to source consciousness.

00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:34.805 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:59:34.805 --> 00:59:39.710 align:middle line:90%


00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:41.510 align:middle line:84%
You are the AI
that they're trying

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:42.930 align:middle line:90%
to fashion themselves after.

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So be who you really
are, a supercomputer

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.140 align:middle line:84%
of source consciousness as
a living angel on Earth.

00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:53.780 align:middle line:90%
Show them what that looks like.

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.790 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very powerful.

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.558 align:middle line:84%
So we welcome that
beautiful golden light.

00:59:59.558 --> 01:00:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, that
beautiful golden light

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that Mary Magdalene brought
in before on your shoulders.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.290 align:middle line:10%
Beginning to allow
that to download

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.900 align:middle line:10%
through your 8th
chakra, which is

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.830 align:middle line:10%
about a foot and a
half above your head

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.560 align:middle line:10%
all the way down through
your crown chakra,

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.390 align:middle line:10%
down the back of your
neck, down your shoulders,

01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:19.730 align:middle line:10%
filling your heart,
all moving all the way

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:23.900 align:middle line:10%
down your solar plexus, filling
your sacral chakra, your root

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
chakra, running up
and down your legs.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they might start to feel
warmer or even a little fiery

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:33.260 align:middle line:84%
depending on how much
of your Kundalini

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.020 align:middle line:90%
is being activated and purified.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.620 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:42.330 align:middle line:10%
And Mary Magdalene and
Jesus are asking for you

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.450 align:middle line:10%
to visualize a coating
of golden energy

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:50.970 align:middle line:10%
around every neuron, every nerve
ending, your spinal column.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a lot of injuries,
both from neurotoxins as well

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.860 align:middle line:90%
as trauma in this room.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So if you're willing to
allow that angelic healing

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to happen for
yourself right now,

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:03.330 align:middle line:90%
you can just say yes, thank you.

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:03.810 align:middle line:90%
I accept.

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:04.275 align:middle line:90%
I receive.

01:01:04.275 --> 01:01:05.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

01:01:05.274 --> 01:01:06.138 align:middle line:90%
I accept.

01:01:06.138 --> 01:01:06.938 align:middle line:90%
I receive.

01:01:06.938 --> 01:01:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:10.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.728 align:middle line:84%
It's actually so easy when
we're willing to believe

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
that these things are possible.

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:22.210 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:26.110 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the weight's
off your shoulders.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
The obstructions are off
the back of your wings.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.825 align:middle line:84%
Your neurological tree
of life is coated.

01:01:31.825 --> 01:01:34.560 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And there's a light
language being

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
downloaded for every
single person in this room.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's unique to every single
person based on your own soul's

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.190 align:middle line:90%
code, your own soul's keycode.

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And as you receive the blessings
of this light language,

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.880 align:middle line:90%
which is one of the--

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
there are many
languages of Sophia god.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.390 align:middle line:84%
This is coming from
your Star Families.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:02:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this room is
connected to a Star Nation.

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Or you wouldn't be here.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's just be honest.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Like is attract
attracted to like.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.630 align:middle line:90%
It's magnetized.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
We are magnetized to
each other for a reason.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.130 align:middle line:10%
So as you receive these
beautiful golden symbols

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:19.720 align:middle line:10%
of light, maybe
just maybe you might

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.810 align:middle line:10%
begin to start to feel
feathers kind of peeking out

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:24.820 align:middle line:10%
of the back of your heart.

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You have a front and a back
chakra for your heart chakra.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.970 align:middle line:90%
What's a chakra?

01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:33.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a wheel of light.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It's a technology for your body.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.380 align:middle line:90%
And you have many of them.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
In the very center
of your chest is

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.210 align:middle line:84%
where those front and
back chakras meet.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:46.930 align:middle line:84%
In the back chakra
of the heart--

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to use
your imagination

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
if you don't feel it--

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.010 align:middle line:84%
imagine feathers
beginning to peek out

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of the back of your heart.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Who doesn't want feathers coming
out the back of their heart?

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
That's just the
coolest thing ever.

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe you might
see a wing tip or even two.

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:07.860 align:middle line:90%
Here they come.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
OK, one, two.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.438 align:middle line:90%
And don't worry.

01:03:12.438 --> 01:03:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Your wings might be a different
color from the person sitting

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.540 align:middle line:90%
next to you.

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing a surprising
amount of blue wings

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:26.908 align:middle line:84%
in this room, the blue
angels, special forces.

01:03:26.908 --> 01:03:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, some of you don't think
you're worthy of your wings.

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:32.890 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

01:03:32.890 --> 01:03:34.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep going.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Mary Magdalene's coming
behind those who are not--

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.370 align:middle line:84%
angels, there are people in
this room that don't want

01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
to accept their angel wings.

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Can we send them
some love, please?

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:46.880 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, now when your
wings come out,

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.880 align:middle line:84%
they may feel like
baby bird wings,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
like I haven't used you
in a really long time.

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
And I feel really vulnerable.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.390 align:middle line:90%
And this feels really naked.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:00.130 align:middle line:90%
And is this safe?

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You're in this room filled
with other Earth angels.

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you
that it's safe.

01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The safest way to
walk with your wings

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.310 align:middle line:90%
is with them all the way up.

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:13.730 align:middle line:90%
No halfway about it.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go all the
way in with your wings.

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:20.030 align:middle line:84%
They've got to go
all the way up.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.700 align:middle line:84%
When you are in conflict
about your light

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
or the technology of your
higher self in human form,

01:04:25.610 --> 01:04:27.620 align:middle line:84%
then you are prey
to psychic attacks.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.760 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The psychic attacks test
you to decide if you're

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.250 align:middle line:90%
really worthy of what you got.

01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:38.212 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:04:38.212 --> 01:04:41.380 align:middle line:90%


01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So you could either test
yourself again and again

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.310 align:middle line:84%
with ideas that you're not
worthy of what you got.

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Or you could just get
over it and get into you.

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And bring those
wings all the way up.

01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:55.738 align:middle line:10%
Visualize yourself
as an archangel.

01:04:55.738 --> 01:04:58.730 align:middle line:90%


01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:01.850 align:middle line:90%
Let yourself really play here.

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
That's part of spirituality too.

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:06.650 align:middle line:90%


01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why Jesus said, bring
the children onto me for theirs

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is the Kingdom of God because
they see and they see clearly.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.500 align:middle line:90%


01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.300 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I think I see
everyone's wings up

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
now even with your
hard feelings about it.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm so proud of you.

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
We don't always have
to like our activations

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.564 align:middle line:90%
to still fulfill them.

01:05:29.564 --> 01:05:32.800 align:middle line:90%


01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.790 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to take this
moment for the Sophia Dragon

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Tribe, the entire High
Council, to bless your wings.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Magdalene
and Isis are coming

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.650 align:middle line:90%
around the front of your body.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Isis is activating
your third eye

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.570 align:middle line:90%
with an ankh, a golden ankh.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:50.590 align:middle line:90%
See, everyone?

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:51.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Good.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is for you to be able
to begin to see physically

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
or in your inner--

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.990 align:middle line:84%
through your inner eyes
the presence of your wings

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:04.825 align:middle line:84%
more and more every day
from this day forward.

01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:08.260 align:middle line:90%


01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:12.460 align:middle line:84%
When Isis walked the Earth
as an ascended master,

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
eventually her wings
became physical.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
She was an initiate
of Hathor's teachings

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
that you can shape
shift in physical form.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And she showed that
to her students

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the power
of those teachings.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
There couldn't be a more
perfect ascended master

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to bless your wings and bless
your ability to see yourself

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.890 align:middle line:90%
clearly as an angel.

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want you to
perhaps if I invite you

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to move your shoulders back.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And as you roll
your shoulders back,

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.690 align:middle line:84%
can you feel the weight
of your wings now?

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.240 align:middle line:90%


01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
There's this pleasant
sensation that there

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is something behind
those shoulder blades

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:00.260 align:middle line:84%
that you are now holding up
from the back of your heart.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%


01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And as you become more and
more energetically present

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.210 align:middle line:84%
with this light body technology
that's literally arising out

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.750 align:middle line:84%
of the back of your
heart, what you discover

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
is that the muscles that
hold up your energetic wings

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:22.660 align:middle line:90%
also keep your heart open.

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:24.353 align:middle line:90%
Why is that important?

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Because every dark
agenda on this planet

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:27.470 align:middle line:90%
wants your heart to shut down.

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:30.390 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

01:07:30.390 --> 01:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
That's how we have so many
people on this planet walking

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.170 align:middle line:84%
around like zombies
just doing whatever

01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:38.170 align:middle line:90%
is on the next advertisement.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.360 align:middle line:84%
They're shut down, pretty
much their whole body

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:44.980 align:middle line:84%
but especially in their heart
because the heart doesn't lie.

01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
If you can shut down the heart,
you've got willing zombies.

01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
If you keep the heart open,
you've got a revolutionary

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.360 align:middle line:90%
because the heart doesn't lie.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.777 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
going to guide you

01:07:56.777 --> 01:07:58.835 align:middle line:84%
to your highest empowerment,
your greatest good.

01:07:58.835 --> 01:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
You're always going to be at the
right place at the right time.

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.877 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what's on fire,
what landslide's happening.

01:08:04.877 --> 01:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
You're always going
to be where you're

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:10.023 align:middle line:84%
meant to be for both
you and your loved ones.

01:08:10.023 --> 01:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty
important right now.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Would you not agree?

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We often are afraid that
if we keep our heart open,

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
our heart's going to get broken.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to tell you
something right now.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:26.109 align:middle line:90%
Your heart will get broken.

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:27.472 align:middle line:90%
Are there mothers in the room?

01:08:27.472 --> 01:08:30.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:33.779 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times have your
heart broken being a mother?

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:35.850 align:middle line:90%
Same for fathers.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean you close
your heart to your child?

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:41.819 align:middle line:90%
Never.

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:43.710 align:middle line:90%
Never.

01:08:43.710 --> 01:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
That's your heart in
another person's body.

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.359 align:middle line:90%
How could you, right?

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Our heart must
stay open if we are

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
going to parent humanity
from spiritual infancy

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.760 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual maturity.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say that again.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Our hearts must stay
open if you and I

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:08.100 align:middle line:84%
are going to parent humanity
from spiritual infancy

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.729 align:middle line:90%
to spiritual maturity.

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual infancy is
how can I get high

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:16.680 align:middle line:90%
on the next spiritual whatever?

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
How many spiritual
experiences can I

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.729 align:middle line:84%
have that I can get
high off of and think

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm having some sort of
connection to the divine?

01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:27.689 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual maturity is I am
here to do my inner journey,

01:09:27.689 --> 01:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
shine my greatest light,
unconditionally, no matter

01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:33.090 align:middle line:84%
what challenges are in my
way because I came here

01:09:33.090 --> 01:09:37.570 align:middle line:84%
to birth heaven on Earth brick
by brick, wing to wing, right?

01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:38.370 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:38.370 --> 01:09:39.840 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.569 align:middle line:84%
That's what spiritual
maturity looks like.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
It's rolling up your
sleeves and doing your deal

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:50.130 align:middle line:84%
to be the fullest potential
of who you came here to be

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:51.737 align:middle line:90%
and nothing less than that.

01:09:51.737 --> 01:09:53.279 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
a perfectionist.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.020 align:middle line:84%
But it is about
being perfectly you

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and making no excuses for
who you came here to be,

01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:59.570 align:middle line:90%
bottom line.

01:09:59.570 --> 01:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, OK.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.097 align:middle line:84%
If we had at least 10% of
humanity doing that right now,

01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:06.930 align:middle line:84%
we would have a completely
different reality

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:08.790 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But that 10% begins
with us and what

01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:14.880 align:middle line:84%
we're deciding to do as
Earth angels from this moment

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.620 align:middle line:90%
forward.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
So we have five minutes left.

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:23.400 align:middle line:90%


01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, angel.

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's take our wings
for a drive or for a flight,

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:35.488 align:middle line:90%
shall we say?

01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:37.530 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make sure
that you have an under--

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:39.390 align:middle line:90%
oh, here's something too.

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Angels, you must
practice discernment.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
What did Jesus and
Mary Magdalene say?

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Be as wise as serpents and
as gentle as doves, OK?

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
The gentle as doves is a
divine feminine invitation

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to grace that we can't arm
wrestle anyone into believing

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:01.770 align:middle line:90%
what we believe.

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It always has to
be an invitation.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
But the discernment
is number one,

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.677 align:middle line:84%
we know when to wipe
the dust from our feet

01:11:10.677 --> 01:11:12.510 align:middle line:84%
when we're leaving a
town that can't receive

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
your message, your peace,
your love, your goodwill,

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:17.610 align:middle line:90%
your generosity.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:20.610 align:middle line:84%
You are not a punching
bag for humanity.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Just because you came here
to be an angel for humanity,

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
you are not a punching
bag for humanity, OK?

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So that's gonna
end for all of us.

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
You must be discerning
with your wings up.

01:11:34.230 --> 01:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
You are like, you're going to
be a magnet in the supermarket.

01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Carts are going to
start flying at you, OK?

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So what we learn about in
year two of the Sophia Code

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
curriculum, Divine
Feminine Christ Leadership,

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
we identify that Sophia
Christ consciousness,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.920 align:middle line:84%
which the angelic
ray is only one

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
ray of because it's a
multi-ray transmission,

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:58.070 align:middle line:90%
the angelic ray is magnetic.

01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:59.850 align:middle line:90%
It's charismatic.

01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:02.160 align:middle line:90%
It's blinding light.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
starving to remember

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:08.952 align:middle line:84%
that outside of
themselves, shall

01:12:08.952 --> 01:12:10.410 align:middle line:84%
we say, because
they don't remember

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.940 align:middle line:84%
that it's inside of them the
way you remember that, right?

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:17.480 align:middle line:84%
So we had this one woman
come to our solstice event

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.230 align:middle line:84%
last week in December
here in Los Angeles.

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you to everyone that came.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:23.400 align:middle line:90%
That was extraordinary event.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And she walked out
of the building

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.570 align:middle line:84%
after she opened
up her angel wings.

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And some guy, she came
up to the stoplight,

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:33.090 align:middle line:84%
and some guy starts screaming
and swearing at her.

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, I just
put my angel wings up.

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:36.310 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is this man attacking me?

01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even do
anything wrong to him.

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, angels, your
light has come

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.505 align:middle line:84%
to be the light in
the darkest of times.

01:12:46.505 --> 01:12:49.360 align:middle line:90%


01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.900 align:middle line:90%
I do not say that lightly.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.160 align:middle line:90%


01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.600 align:middle line:90%
It is the truth.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And so you must be
willing to spiritually

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:02.407 align:middle line:84%
mature in your
discernment as well.

01:13:02.407 --> 01:13:03.490 align:middle line:90%
You're not a punching bag.

01:13:03.490 --> 01:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
You're here to be respected.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.190 align:middle line:84%
You're not here to convince
anyone of anything.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.920 align:middle line:84%
You're here to help those
who want to be helped.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Better formula, right?

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.090 align:middle line:84%
A lot of Earth angels
kind of throw themselves

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
in front of the
bus of a ministry.

01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
moment to practice

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:25.660 align:middle line:84%
what making your
offering to people

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.150 align:middle line:84%
who want your offering
feels and looks like.

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So angel wings up, feeling
your angel wings connecting

01:13:31.930 --> 01:13:36.250 align:middle line:84%
to your breath deep
within your belly.

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.066 align:middle line:84%
It is so stunning to see a
room full of angel wings.

01:13:40.066 --> 01:13:40.866 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

01:13:40.866 --> 01:13:44.570 align:middle line:90%


01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I'd
like you to feel,

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or if you can't feel, again no
right or wrong, just visualize

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
or imagine your
wings, your feathers

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.670 align:middle line:84%
brushing up against other
feathers in the room.

01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:56.840 align:middle line:90%
Feathers feel really good.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Great.

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to notice that
your wings are very powerful.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:06.390 align:middle line:90%
They're very strong.

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
They have very strong
muscles running up

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.320 align:middle line:84%
the sides that hold up
the length of those wings.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
From every feather
in your wings,

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.550 align:middle line:84%
I would like for you
to think of one person

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
that you love very
much that you know

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
would receive the healing
of your angelic light, not

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
somebody that you wish
you could arm wrestle

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:29.210 align:middle line:84%
into the love, someone you
know that really would receive

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:32.040 align:middle line:90%
your love in this moment.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh god, this is so beautiful.

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can pick a
color, a ray of light.

01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:39.830 align:middle line:84%
You could use-- you could work
with that golden angelic ray

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
of light.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And see that light radiating
out from your wings

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:47.088 align:middle line:84%
and being directed to
that beautiful person

01:14:47.088 --> 01:14:48.005 align:middle line:90%
that you love so much.

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%


01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:53.620 align:middle line:84%
You might see them smiling
in your mind's eye.

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.258 align:middle line:90%
You might see them crying.

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.591 align:middle line:84%
You might see them or feel
them saying thank you to you.

01:14:57.591 --> 01:15:01.740 align:middle line:90%


01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
And I invite you to
thank them for receiving

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.270 align:middle line:84%
your angelic light,
honoring you as an angel

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:13.570 align:middle line:84%
here on Earth with a
very powerful mission,

01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
feeling that connection to
their heart through your wings.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:21.960 align:middle line:90%


01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:29.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I want you to experience
how your wings can actually

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:34.220 align:middle line:90%
come forward and bless yourself.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Curl your wings around
to face your own face.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And bring that angelic
light to your own heart.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You may begin to feel the energy
that that angelic medicine

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.690 align:middle line:84%
running through your third eye
all the way down your throat

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:54.920 align:middle line:84%
into your heart all
the way down your legs,

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
blessing yourself with the
power of your own wings.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.830 align:middle line:90%


01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Very often, Earth
angels have a lot

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
of difficulty
receiving the gifts

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:08.390 align:middle line:84%
that they offer to so
many to themselves.

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really big practice
that you can do every day.

01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
Finally, there's something
that you really believe in.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
There's something that's
very dear to your heart.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:24.230 align:middle line:84%
There's something that you may
feel very passionate about.

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to direct
that same angelic medicine

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:29.440 align:middle line:90%
from your wings to the cause.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Or there may be a
circumstance in your life

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:36.040 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
bless and affirm

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.620 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
divine will, there

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
is a solution beyond
your understanding,

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and that your wings are
commanding that miracle

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
to go forward and backwards
into time to what you care

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
about, directing this beautiful
energy to what you really,

01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:56.380 align:middle line:90%
really care about.

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, I want you
to ask your wings

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
to magnetize to you other Earth
angels that care just as much

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:08.410 align:middle line:84%
about what you care about to
feel the power of your wings

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:11.755 align:middle line:84%
now open and up so that you can
be seen and they can find you.

01:17:11.755 --> 01:17:14.500 align:middle line:90%


01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Let's stop being so alone.

01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:19.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's find each other, angels.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And let's start working
together, wing to wing,

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and feeling the magnetism
of your feathers

01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:26.574 align:middle line:90%
calling out to theirs.

01:17:26.574 --> 01:17:35.780 align:middle line:90%


01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And feeling how every time you
use your wings in this way,

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
you stand up a
little straighter.

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You feel your spine
standing up straighter.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
It's actually
aligning your spine

01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:49.880 align:middle line:84%
to stay open to your direct
connection to source.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

01:17:52.590 --> 01:17:55.970 align:middle line:84%
You're not slouching over
wondering what's the solution?

01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:59.354 align:middle line:90%
There's a direct connection.

01:17:59.354 --> 01:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%


01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Finally to close,
I had said I was

01:18:07.930 --> 01:18:10.890 align:middle line:84%
going to share
something on the website

01:18:10.890 --> 01:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that I really wanted
to go deeper into.

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:16.120 align:middle line:90%
But this felt really important.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Through the connection
of your wings,

01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:24.310 align:middle line:84%
see how high your wings can
expand up through the sky.

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:26.920 align:middle line:90%
There is a star in the universe.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Allow your wings to
connect to this star.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There's information in
other parts of the universe

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that your wings act
like antennas to connect

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:37.000 align:middle line:90%
with across the multiverse.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.650 align:middle line:90%


01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:44.340 align:middle line:10%
What we think of
as angelic orders

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:47.820 align:middle line:10%
from the Bible or even
other sacred texts,

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:51.690 align:middle line:10%
many of those beings were
actually our ancestors

01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:56.370 align:middle line:10%
across this multiverse
that ascended, became

01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:03.570 align:middle line:10%
golden, ascended civilizations
that cleared all their karma,

01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:05.550 align:middle line:10%
experienced so much
liberation that they

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:08.910 align:middle line:10%
became devoted to the ascension
of other planets and beings.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Does this make sense?

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Very often when we
think of angels,

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:17.510 align:middle line:84%
you are actually connecting with
different Star Nation lineages.

01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
You're connecting both
to your past selves

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and your future selves,
to your star ancestors.

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be sharing more
about that in teachings

01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to come this year.

01:19:28.740 --> 01:19:32.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to thank you all so
much for this time together.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.060 align:middle line:90%
It's been-- thank you.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.130 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:38.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:41.786 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:41.786 --> 01:19:45.600 align:middle line:90%


01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.270 align:middle line:90%
Blessings to you.

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:49.800 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor and a privilege.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
We hope to see you in
our events this year.

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:53.220 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
Namaste.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.320 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.370 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.256 align:middle line:90%
