00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:08.630 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, are you all ready to
go on a journey of science,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
connection,
consciousness, community?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Look around at each other,
because you are all part

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:90%
of the Resonance family.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've got some of our
researchers in the room.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure Nassim will tell you
a little bit more about that.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And each of you got some
really, really special brand

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.490 align:middle line:90%
new brochures.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:84%
One of them tells you all about
the ARK crystal technology.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure you
see these up here.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And we've got
Andrea here who will

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
talk to you
afterwards for anyone

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
who would like to get one.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Today you'll probably
hear a little bit more.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.310 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are already
familiar with this technology?

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:90%
How many of you have one?

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:90%
Yay.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then how many,
this is your first time

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.065 align:middle line:90%
learning about the ARK crystals?

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:57.865 align:middle line:90%
Hands up high.

00:00:57.865 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, you'll learn about it a
little bit in your brochure.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Nassim will tell you.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the culmination
of his 30 years of work.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And his science, his technology,
It's all wrapped up in this.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.710 align:middle line:90%
And they are so powerful.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:84%
You'll hear more, and you'll
get to feel them up here.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
I am going to lovingly
turn this over.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Because it is such an
honor to have Nassim here.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, with all
of his research,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and the way he can
take science to a place

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
that we learn how to
live our lives better.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's give our love.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.717 align:middle line:90%
Nassim Haramein.

00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:38.519 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you guys.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.440 align:middle line:10%
Hi, everybody from the
internet out there,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:10%
Gaia, the non-local
people, the galaxy.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I was hoping to do
this really cozy,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's a cozy crowd.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:90%
You guys want to come forward?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.670 align:middle line:90%
Or you OK back there?

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's get together.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
We could-- if we wouldn't
be in a hotel room,

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:84%
we could do a little campfire,
pull out the marshmallows.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.230 align:middle line:10%
No, those are nasty.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.985 align:middle line:90%
Maybe organic ones.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Organic marshmallows
is like a misnomer.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Can you still all see me?

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
Can the people out there in
the non-local world see me?

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, good.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.600 align:middle line:10%
So, you know, we can talk
about all these things.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm happy to talk
about all these things.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:10%
I have some stuff here.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:10%
It's a presentation that was
done by one of our colleagues

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.040 align:middle line:10%
and collaborator and friend,
William Brown, in the house.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And we have a few others
from our research group

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:90%
in the house.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
We have Olivier over
there, doctor in physics--

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
--from France,
excellent physicist.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:10%
And we have Johanna
from Germany,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:10%
here medical doctor and
surgeon, heart surgeon.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:10%
So if your heart is palpitating
during this presentation,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:10%
she'll take care of you.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:10%
So we are in--

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:10%
so maybe we'll get some
questions directed at them

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:10%
as well, because they're
there to make sure I don't put

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.110 align:middle line:10%
both feet in the same bucket.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I have a lot
of things to say.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:84%
But I really would
like this to be more

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:90%
of what you guys want to know.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Because, like, there's a
panoply of places I could go.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And really, the
title of this talk

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is "The human consciousness
and the human antenna."

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And it should have
been "Consciousness

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.500 align:middle line:84%
in the fractal human antenna,"
because it's a little more

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
complex than just like, you
know, these kind of ugly things

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:90%
you see on the houses.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:10%
But it has similar principles.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And I want to start,
how many people

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:90%
here are familiar with my work?

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, so most of you.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And you've all heard about
the holographic mass solution,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:84%
You've all known that I've
published this in 2012.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.620 align:middle line:10%
And then in 2013,
the prediction I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:10%
made for the radius
of the proton

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.320 align:middle line:10%
was measured in an
accelerator in Switzerland,

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:10%
and that this
prediction is still

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:10%
the most accurate theoretical
prediction of the radius

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.420 align:middle line:10%
of the proton on the planet.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And who was at my
talk on Saturday?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:10%
OK, most of you.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.480 align:middle line:10%
And that talk on Saturday, I
announced that my latest paper

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.510 align:middle line:10%
just passed peer review two days
ago-- or three days ago now,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.700 align:middle line:10%
or four days now--

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.650 align:middle line:10%
and that-- times go by.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It's all one big day,
according to Janis Joplin.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:10%
And so it passed peer review.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really excited about it.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:10%
It's in a good physics journal.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And it extends the solution.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We had extended it
to the electron.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We output the whole
table of elements.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.650 align:middle line:10%
And now we're able
to predict the radius

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:10%
and the mass, the critical
mass of the universe,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:10%
without the need--

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.690 align:middle line:10%
oh, am I pushing buttons?

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:10%
Without the need to incorporate
dark matter and dark energy.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:10%
That is, we get rid of that.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:10%
Because our equation gives the
correct mass of the universe,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.650 align:middle line:10%
unlike the standard
equation, which

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:10%
is missing 96% of the
mass of the universe.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.410 align:middle line:10%
So in our case, we're
not having to add

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.970 align:middle line:10%
some weird matter that doesn't
seem to be able to be detected.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing dark
about our equation.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very nice.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:10%
And it outputs something
really powerful.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
That is, it's
telling us something

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
very fundamental and
different about the universe.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there's something
black about the equation.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I missed it, I'm sorry.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
That is, it says the universe
is a black hole, right?

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
As a fundamental
structure of space,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:90%
the universe obeys the exact--

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
you know, this equation
is very, very clear--

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:09.570 align:middle line:84%
it obeys the exact
solution for a black hole.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
to say the reason

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
it passed peer review
is that the mathematics

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.295 align:middle line:84%
of the equations in that
paper are accurate and exact.

00:08:22.295 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's really something
that can make you think, well,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.210 align:middle line:90%
how can that be?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:10%
The universe would not
seem to be a black hole.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
think of a black hole,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
you think of this object
that's so dense, that's

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.910 align:middle line:84%
so massive, that not even
light can emerge from it,

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
because the gravitational
force is so strong that it's

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:90%
sucking everything in.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:10%
So if it's something
that is very dense,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:10%
you know, it's not my direct
experience of this world.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:10%
It's like, when I look in
the night sky out there,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:10%
it seems like it's very
spacious, that it's not

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:10%
so dense.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:10%
But that's because of the
size of the black hole.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:10%
So just to give
you an idea, if I

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:10%
was to calculate the density
of a black hole for the size

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:10%
of our solar system,
it would be the density

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:10%
of the air of our atmosphere.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:10%
So If I just put air
of our atmosphere

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.930 align:middle line:10%
in all of the solar system, it
would have the right density

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:10%
for your solar system
to be a black hole.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:10%
Bigger the size of the black
hole, lower the density

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:10%
has to be, because more mass
you're able to put in there.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:10%
And so, you know, a black hole
the size of our solar system

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:10%
is about the density of air.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
A black hole the size
of the black holes

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
in the center of galaxies is
about the density of water.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that a black
hole the size of our universe

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:90%
can have a very low density.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it does, because
the mass or the critical mass

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:84%
of our universe inside
the bubble of our universe

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.530 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the solution
to a black hole.

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.600 align:middle line:90%
So we are a black hole.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:90%
And you can imagine--

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.820 align:middle line:84%
you know, think
about it this way.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You know that we think that the
universe is expanding, right?

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Why do we think that?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Because stars appear
to be redshifted.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.440 align:middle line:10%
Very specific objects in the
universe that we're looking at

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.900 align:middle line:10%
appears to be redshifted.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So "redshift" means
that the Doppler effect

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:24.520 align:middle line:84%
of light-- meaning, as
light moves away from you,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
the wavelength gets longer,
so it goes towards red.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
As it moves towards
you, the wavelength

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
gets shorter, because
it gets compressed,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and that's going towards blue.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Just like an ambulance
sounds different

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:10%
as it's away from you, as it
comes closer the pitch goes up,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:10%
so is the same for light.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And so we know that things
are redshifted out there.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:10%
So you can think of it
moving away from you.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:10%
But it would be just as true if
you're moving away from them.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.362 align:middle line:90%
Huh?

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:11.162 align:middle line:10%
Ah.

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.380 align:middle line:10%
So, you know, we could think
of ourselves collapsing

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:31.160 align:middle line:10%
into a singularity right now
with the edge of the universe

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:10%
moving away from us.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:84%
That's a different
picture, isn't it?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:46.510 align:middle line:10%
And so this is something that's
not been considered so much.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying that's
exactly what's happening.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.820 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying that the--

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
put that aside.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.380 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying that, if you
have an expanding universe--

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:10%
so the equation says--

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:10%
let's just recap.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.940 align:middle line:10%
The holographic
mass solution that's

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:10%
the start of this whole
thing is the result

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:10%
of describing the structure of
spacetime at the quantum level

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle line:10%
in terms of mini little packets,
teeny little packets that

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:10%
are little quantized
structure of spacetime.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.040 align:middle line:84%
That spacetime is discrete
at the very fine level way

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
lower than the atom, billions
of times smaller than the atom.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Spacetime is not smooth.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It just appears
smooth at large scale.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you get to the bottom
of it, it's actually granular.

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And each grain is a
little bit of information.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:10%
Just like the water in
your tub appears smooth,

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.980 align:middle line:10%
and when you pull
the plug it orbits,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:10%
and if you put the rubber
ducky there it starts orbiting.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:10%
But if you look really close,
and you see the water curving,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.000 align:middle line:10%
so you might think
water is smooth,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:10%
just like Einstein
described spacetime

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:10%
as being smooth and
curving where there's

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:10%
gravity making things orbit.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.070 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
really close, you

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
can see that the
water is actually

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:84%
made of little
grains we call atoms

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:90%
that makes up little molecules.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And these molecules are
orbiting in the region

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:90%
where it's curving.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
it's spinning there

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.890 align:middle line:90%
that the surface is curving.

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I wrote equations showing that
the structure of spacetime

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:84%
is quantized at
the Planck scale,

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light scale.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has little bits of
data, little spherical bits

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:84%
of information that makes up
the structure of spacetime.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:20.500 align:middle line:10%
And when the information is
orbiting in coherent matter,

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.600 align:middle line:10%
when spacetime as
self-organizing structures,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:10%
when it has co-moving
dynamics, it produce curvature.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
call gravity and mass.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make sure
that you guys understand

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.935 align:middle line:84%
that mass and gravity in
this view is the same thing.

00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:10%
Einstein showed
that gravity curves,

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:10%
that gravity is the curvature
of space in the region of mass.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.940 align:middle line:10%
But we know from
special relativity

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:03.800 align:middle line:10%
that mass is equal to energy.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So you could just
say, where there's

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
energy there's curvature.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.740 align:middle line:10%
You can equate energy to mass
using e equals mc squared.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:10%
I'm here to tell you
these equations that

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:10%
are very precise are saying,
well, there is no difference.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:10%
Whatever you are calling energy
is the curvature of spacetime.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, it's all the
dynamic of the same thing.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just the humans
made categories.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
They said mass, and
they said energy,

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:90%
and then they put equivalence.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
But in all cases, they
can't tell you what it is.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:10%
And then what we're
discovering from this

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:10%
is that it's all information
moving in spacetime.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.780 align:middle line:84%
So where you have a vortex in
spacetime, you have matter--

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:84%
mass, energy, whatever you want
to call it, it's all the same.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
expand to the universe--

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:90%
so now imagine.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is the equation.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.750 align:middle line:90%
We took the proton.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It gives the right
solution for the proton.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
It says that the information
inside the proton,

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.730 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these little
bits of information,

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
relative to the
information on the surface,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
in terms of these little
Planck bits of information,

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is the mass of the
proton and its radius.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:84%
When you calculate that, it
gives the exact correct answer.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.000 align:middle line:10%
That is, the information
that's able to come out

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:10%
of the proton, come out
of the event horizon,

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:10%
is equal to what we
call mass or energy.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:52.520 align:middle line:10%
Basically, spacetime orbits,
billions of these little bits

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:10%
of information.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:10%
And the ones that are
able to escape the spin,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:10%
that radiate out, is what
we call mass or energy.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.260 align:middle line:10%
Or we could call it the
electromagnetic field.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:10%
But that's another story.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.340 align:middle line:10%
But, again, it's just
different equations

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.475 align:middle line:10%
describing different parts
of the same elephant.

00:18:16.475 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But so it's spinning,
and it's radiating.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But then, if you take
that little spin,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and you grew it to the
size of the universe,

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:90%
what would happen?

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.430 align:middle line:84%
It's what I did in
this latest paper.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:84%
If I take the little
proton, and then I

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
grow it to the size
of the universe,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:48.350 align:middle line:84%
what happens to this information
exchange, this radiation?

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:90%
What mass would I end up with?

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Because the surface
size is changing.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:90%
So it can radiate more.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:90%
And so it has a larger mass.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.060 align:middle line:84%
There's more stuff that can
be measured out of this thing.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:10%
And so when I grew it to
the size of the universe,

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.210 align:middle line:10%
I got the exact mass
of the universe.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:10%
It worked.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:10%
Now, the probability of
that working from the scale

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:10%
of a teeny, weeny, little,
beady, little thing,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.600 align:middle line:10%
proton thing, all the way
to the size of a universe,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:10%
and not [MUTED]-ing-ing up
anywhere on the way up,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:10%
and like the equation just
going completely sideways on me,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:10%
and ending up with a mass
completely wrong is pretty

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:10%
large.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:49.280 align:middle line:10%
It's like, you know, if
you're leaving Europe,

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:10%
and you're Columbus, and
you're going to India,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:02.040 align:middle line:10%
and you mess up by a few degrees
on your vectors, guess what?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.120 align:middle line:90%
You arrive in North America.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:90%
You mess it up pretty bad.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:10%
And then when you arrive,
and you meet the local guys,

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.410 align:middle line:10%
you call them Indians.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:10%
I think that's pretty funny,
that history has recorded this.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:10%
To me, it's a little
bit embarrassing.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.700 align:middle line:10%
I think it's very
funny, as well,

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:10%
that they all claim
that Columbus discovered

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:10%
North America, which is--

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.560 align:middle line:10%
clearly when he arrived,
there was already people here.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't know which part
of that they missed.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, it's
this kind of thing

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.330 align:middle line:10%
that when you
discover something,

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:10%
if somebody discovered
it before you,

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.290 align:middle line:10%
it's not quite a novelty, right?

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.795 align:middle line:10%


00:21:05.795 --> 00:21:06.595 align:middle line:10%
Anyway.

00:21:06.595 --> 00:21:10.696 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.696 --> 00:21:16.870 align:middle line:10%
If you mess up by a few
degrees on a long distance,

00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:10%
it gets ugly really fast, right?

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:10%
So imagine if you
mess up a few degrees

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:10%
on a scale from the
proton to the universe.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:10%
You're going to miss
the universe altogether.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:10%
Like, you're just
like, oh, my god.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:10%
You'll probably end up
in the fifth dimension

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:10%
somewhere where
that would happen,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:10%
where there's a lot
of purple clothes.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm just kidding.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:22:00.160 align:middle line:10%
It's really remarkable
that an equation would be

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:10%
so accurate across such scales.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Because, as well, I'm measuring
with little Planck oscillators.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And so they little
Planck oscillators

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.460 align:middle line:90%
are really small units.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is important as well
to understand-- the measurement

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
of these little bits of
information I'm using

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.320 align:middle line:90%
is the only natural units.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The universe has--
and the reason

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
dimensions this way

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
is because dimensions
for physicists

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
is not like things that
are like another world.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:10%
Dimensions for
physicists are just

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:10%
different planes in
a complex structure,

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:10%
like in a complex plane, or
different vectors in space.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:10%
So there's confusion between
what spiritual people talk

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:10%
about dimensions and vectors.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:06.580 align:middle line:10%
But basically, so you could
think of different scales

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:10%
as different dimensions.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.300 align:middle line:10%
But so imagine the dimensions--

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.270 align:middle line:10%
because literally,
"dimensions"--

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:10%
imagine the dimensions
of a Planck,

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:10%
it's hard to define
how small it is.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:84%
But let me just
start by saying, it's

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:37.860 align:middle line:84%
so small that it, you know, is
something that's fundamental.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:10%
Meaning, current dimensions--
and that could probably be

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.880 align:middle line:10%
debated by some researchers--

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.160 align:middle line:10%
but generally, it's-- and there
might be some validity that

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.780 align:middle line:10%
there's some connections to the
current dimensioning systems we

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.800 align:middle line:10%
use.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.400 align:middle line:90%
But generally, it's arbitrary.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And there might be connection
to the Planck scale.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm discovering some lately,
like the Planck length in miles

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:84%
is very, very good
approximation of 1.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, I find
that interesting.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:22.470 align:middle line:10%
But if you think of a unit
that is a natural unit--

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:10%
that is, it's not
arbitrary, it's not

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:10%
like the foot of a
king, it's not the elbow

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.545 align:middle line:10%
to the hand of some
pharaoh, it's not like--

00:24:31.545 --> 00:24:35.265 align:middle line:10%


00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:10%
it's a thing that is like
fundamental to nature,

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.590 align:middle line:10%
like the units of measurement
that nature would use.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:10%
Then the only thing you
have for natural units

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.550 align:middle line:10%
is the Planck scale.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Because it comes from
fundamental constants.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:10%
These are energy constant.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Like the Planck
constant is the energy

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:08.650 align:middle line:84%
that is required for electrons
to go from one orbital

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.660 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:10%
It's a fundamental energy
packet that we know exists

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:10%
and that we can measure.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's like a
fundamental natural unit.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:26.140 align:middle line:10%
Now, these units
are really teeny.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.360 align:middle line:10%
So to give you an
idea of scale--

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and you know this approximately.

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:10%
I just want to [? retur ?] this.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.610 align:middle line:10%
If you're made out of a
hundred trillion cells--

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.100 align:middle line:10%
so already, cells are small.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:43.330 align:middle line:10%
You have to have a
microscope to see them.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:10%
Each cell is made of a
hundred trillion atoms.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.540 align:middle line:10%
You're already-- luck
with your microscope.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.230 align:middle line:10%
You won't see the atoms,
they're too small.

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:55.540 align:middle line:10%
Now you need an
electron microscope.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:10%
And even then, you're
not going to see much,

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.870 align:middle line:10%
because the electron
relative to the atom

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:10%
is like along the same scale.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:10%
So it's really
hard to see atoms.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
We're just starting,
in the last few years,

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:90%
to be able to image atoms.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Because they're really tiny--

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.060 align:middle line:84%
a hundred trillion
atoms per cell.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you took
one of these atoms,

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
you made it the
dome of the Vatican,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.440 align:middle line:84%
then the nuclei, the
proton, would be the head

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:90%
of a pin inside the dome.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So the proton is really,
really, really, really tiny.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Well, if I took one
of those little Planck

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.260 align:middle line:10%
oscillators, these little Planck
link, these little packets

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.220 align:middle line:10%
of energy, and I grew it to
the size of a grain of sand,

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.490 align:middle line:10%
then the proton would have
the diameter from here

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:10%
to Alpha Centauri,
or approximately--

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:06.000 align:middle line:10%
no, yes, approximately yeah,
40 trillion kilometers,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:10%
approximately.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.340 align:middle line:10%
Right?

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:10.480 align:middle line:10%
It's a big proton.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And the Planck is still a
grain of sand relative to that.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.350 align:middle line:10%
So imagine how
many grains of sand

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:10%
you can put in a bubble that
has 40 trillion kilometers.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:10%
That is a large amount of sand.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.500 align:middle line:10%
So the equation counts the
amount of grains of sand

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:10%
inside that bubble,
and then divides

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.570 align:middle line:10%
the amount of grains of
sand inside the bubble

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.870 align:middle line:10%
to the amount of grains of sand
on the surface of the bubble.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.410 align:middle line:10%
And when it does that,
it gets the right mass

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:59.690 align:middle line:10%
of that bubble, the right
energy of that bubble,

00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:10%
with, like,
eight-digit accuracy.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:10%
So, like, you know--

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:10%


00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.850 align:middle line:10%
the fact that this comes
out right is insane.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.930 align:middle line:90%


00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, I mean,
you could easily

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
be missing a bunch of sand,
and you'd be [MUTED] luck.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.190 align:middle line:90%
You'd be off.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:31.324 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:28:31.324 --> 00:28:35.808 align:middle line:84%
>> So the [INAUDIBLE] you do
already know that so-called

00:28:35.808 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:90%
surface, how much--

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:28:39.386 --> 00:28:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, you input
the radius of the proton,

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and you output the mass.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Or you input the mass,
and you output the radius.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Just like a normal equation,
like the Schwarzschild radius

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:55.060 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, right?

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:90%


00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.140 align:middle line:84%
But you can come at it from
different size as well.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You can define the scales
relative to each other

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.835 align:middle line:90%
and figure out the scales.

00:29:07.835 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:10%
So back to the analogy
of Christopher Columbus

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.360 align:middle line:10%
on his boat putting
a few degrees off,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.650 align:middle line:10%
if you're a few
grains of sand off

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:27.820 align:middle line:10%
relative to the amount
of sand in there,

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.210 align:middle line:10%
it's not going to be pretty
when you grow that puppy

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:10%
to the size of the universe.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:39.370 align:middle line:10%
You're using such
small units, right?

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:10%


00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:47.650 align:middle line:10%
So it would come out
wrong, really bad.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.195 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't.

00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:56.370 align:middle line:10%
But imagine the sand in there
in the proton, in a bubble

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:10%
40 trillion kilometers.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:04.370 align:middle line:10%
And then grow that bubble
to the size of the universe.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:11.870 align:middle line:10%
And imagine the sand as it
grows, like, the circulation

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.090 align:middle line:10%
of the sand in there.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:10%
Can you guys visualize that?

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:10%
The sand would have
disturbance, right?

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.450 align:middle line:10%
There would be density gradient.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:30.530 align:middle line:10%
There would be spinning
dynamics as the bubble grew.

00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.820 align:middle line:10%
And it grows fast.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.490 align:middle line:10%
So it's very dynamic.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
about why it's going fast.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
But the turbulence, think
of it as a fluid flow.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Because this Planck
field is like a fluid.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It's like a superfluid.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.770 align:middle line:84%
In technical term, it would
be called a Planck plasma.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.785 align:middle line:84%
So the grains of
sand is an analogy.

00:31:01.785 --> 00:31:04.590 align:middle line:84%
It's more like a
fluid, or a gas,

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
or a very highly
energized plasma.

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine the
fluid dynamics of that sand

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.850 align:middle line:90%
as it's going along.

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:24.100 align:middle line:10%
So as the universe expands, the
dynamics inside the universe

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:30.370 align:middle line:10%
is very specific
toroidal dynamics,

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:10%
in which if you were looking
at the redshift along any point

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:10%
in which you're in
the universe, things

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:10%
would look like they're
moving away from you.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not as simple as
the mainstream interpretation

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:49.610 align:middle line:90%
was of just a bubble growing.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a little more
complex than that.

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.380 align:middle line:10%
The universe just happens
to be a little more complex

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.430 align:middle line:10%
than a soap bubble growing.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so you could imagine that
even if the bubble had stopped

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.160 align:middle line:84%
growing, you would
still see redshift,

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.790 align:middle line:84%
because the stuff in
it is still moving.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.760 align:middle line:10%
And you might be in the
part of the torus that's

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:23.650 align:middle line:10%
going back down, and everything
else is moving away from you.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.572 align:middle line:90%
And so it's redshifted.

00:32:26.572 --> 00:32:28.820 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.010 align:middle line:90%
You need to have as it grows--

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.253 align:middle line:84%
especially if it's
spinning, because remember,

00:32:33.253 --> 00:32:34.420 align:middle line:90%
the whole thing is spinning.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.910 align:middle line:84%
That's how it got coherent
in the first place.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:38.020 align:middle line:10%
So it's spinning.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
As it grows-- it's
still spinning--

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.690 align:middle line:90%
it would have Coriolis effect.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.920 align:middle line:10%
So you'd have a boundary
condition at the equator.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And it would spin in one
direction at the top,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and in another
direction at the bottom.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:10%
So you'd have matter
and antimatter.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:10%
You'd have matter that spins
in one direction and matter

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.710 align:middle line:10%
that spins in another.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm telling
you all this stuff,

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.900 align:middle line:84%
because I'm trying to develop
a picture in your mind.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.960 align:middle line:84%
There is a problem in
physics that there's

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:23.060 align:middle line:84%
more matter than antimatter
that we're able to detect.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, that might be because when
we're in the part of the torus

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.360 align:middle line:84%
where it's spinning
in one direction,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.700 align:middle line:84%
so we are seeing a lot of the
matter going in one direction,

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.070 align:middle line:84%
but we're close
enough to the equator

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.458 align:middle line:84%
that there is spray
from the lower torus,

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing some of the
matter going in the other.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:46.660 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:10%
See?

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.980 align:middle line:10%
Now you've got a geometric idea.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.550 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of evidence
of the universe spinning.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:84%
It's generally ignored, because
the standard model insists

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.395 align:middle line:90%
that the universe is static.

00:34:02.395 --> 00:34:06.880 align:middle line:90%


00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.699 align:middle line:10%
How could the universe be
non-rotating structure when

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.559 align:middle line:10%
everything in it is spinning?

00:34:14.559 --> 00:34:19.285 align:middle line:90%


00:34:19.285 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:10%
It's remarkable.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.199 align:middle line:10%


00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Godel didn't think so, and
solved Einstein's field

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:10%
equation with rotation.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:10%
But he was ignored.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:33.100 align:middle line:10%
He was one of the best
mathematicians ever.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:10%
Sadly, he died fairly
early, because I

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.004 align:middle line:10%
think he committed suicide.

00:34:38.004 --> 00:34:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Some of the greatest
mathematicians didn't make it.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:51.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, Cantor was another
one that was remarkable.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Cantor spent basically
most of his life trying

00:34:54.550 --> 00:35:00.460 align:middle line:84%
to solve 1 plus 1 equals 2,
which has a fractional problem.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Because when you say
1, what do you mean?

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.600 align:middle line:84%
There is incredible
work that was

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.610 align:middle line:84%
done by these
mathematicians that

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:90%
were working on infinities.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:17.560 align:middle line:10%
But basically,
what I'm saying to

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:25.840 align:middle line:10%
you is that we're living in
this dynamic toroidal structure

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.970 align:middle line:10%
of spacetime that's
circulating Planck

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.550 align:middle line:10%
information across scale.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:37.930 align:middle line:84%
This sand information that's
circulating went from a proton

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.810 align:middle line:90%
to a universe across all scale.

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And imagine the sand
making galaxies.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.994 align:middle line:90%
They would-- go ahead.

00:35:45.994 --> 00:35:47.702 align:middle line:84%
>> That information
you're talking about,

00:35:47.702 --> 00:35:49.614 align:middle line:90%
is that what consciousness is?

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you haven't said
the word "consciousness."

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.910 align:middle line:10%
>> I know.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting there.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.560 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I'm sorry.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.066 align:middle line:90%
Am I hurting your head?

00:36:01.066 --> 00:36:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course, what you're
talking about is such a small

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:09.286 align:middle line:10%
scale that it's hard for human
mind to actually visualize it.

00:36:09.286 --> 00:36:11.138 align:middle line:84%
I see a torus in
front of me, it's

00:36:11.138 --> 00:36:12.530 align:middle line:90%
beginning to make a little bit--

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.340 align:middle line:90%
>> More sense?

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.240 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right, right, right.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's small scale and big
scale, because it's a universe.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.760 align:middle line:90%
So it happens at both scales.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.540 align:middle line:90%
But I'm getting there.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.600 align:middle line:84%
I was just about
to say the C word.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.416 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.416 --> 00:36:32.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god.

00:36:32.778 --> 00:36:34.140 align:middle line:90%
That's what I want to hear --

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I was avoiding it.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.210 align:middle line:90%


00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:41.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I
started presenting

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.010 align:middle line:84%
in physics conference,
it literally

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:90%
was evil to say the C word.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.480 align:middle line:84%
If you said the C word, if you
said the word "consciousness"

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.370 align:middle line:90%
in physics conference--

00:36:53.370 --> 00:37:00.865 align:middle line:84%
and I did-- you would
get asked to vacate.

00:37:00.865 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was actually told by
a fairly famous physicist

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that their equations are
much better than mine,

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.659 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
require consciousness.

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.180 align:middle line:84%
My answer was, do you realize
you just insulted yourself?

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.976 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, clearly he's
somebody the conscious wrote

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.560 align:middle line:90%
the equation.

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:38.190 align:middle line:84%
So sorry, it did
require consciousness.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.980 align:middle line:90%


00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:47.310 align:middle line:10%
But basically-- so if
you have this circulation

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:51.080 align:middle line:10%
of information bits in
these toroidal dynamics,

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:10%
now you can say,
OK, now let me look

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.780 align:middle line:10%
at more details between the
proton and the universe.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.580 align:middle line:10%
But before I get there, I just
want to say, the universe--

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.260 align:middle line:10%
like, why did the
proton go nuts and grow

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:08.910 align:middle line:10%
to the size of the universe?

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.990 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It's like popcorn?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:15.000 align:middle line:90%
What the heck, you know.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Protons are the most stable
objects in our universe.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We've never seen a
proton do anything.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Like, they are completely
self-sustaining.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, 13.7 billion
years later, no decay

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:40.080 align:middle line:84%
has been found in
any protons anywhere

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.730 align:middle line:84%
we look in the universe we
would detect proton decay.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:45.870 align:middle line:90%
And we can't see it.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And so proton are very stable.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.860 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, because when you
do this calculation,

00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.160 align:middle line:84%
you find that the
amount of grain

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of sand inside the proton,
the amount of energy

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:84%
from the Planck field
inside the proton,

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.510 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to the amount
of energy in the universe.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.255 align:middle line:90%
That's why the equation works.

00:39:08.255 --> 00:39:09.630 align:middle line:84%
When you grow it
to the universe,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.370 align:middle line:90%
you get the right mass.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So you have exact equilibrium
at the boundary of the proton.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
But now imagine one of those
protons escaping our universe.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:10%
Imagine one of those little
things all of a sudden crossing

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.280 align:middle line:10%
the event horizon
of our universe

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.690 align:middle line:10%
and ending up on the other side.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It would end up in a
region in a universe that

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.950 align:middle line:90%
has a much lower density.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:41.910 align:middle line:10%
And it would just
go [BOOM] expand

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.000 align:middle line:10%
like crazy very, very, very
quickly, because there's

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.050 align:middle line:10%
a lot of energy in there.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.560 align:middle line:84%
All the energy of
our universe would

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
be in there pushing
on that thing,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and it would expand super fast.

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can start
looking at the scales

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.280 align:middle line:84%
of the different dynamics
of the toroidal field.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So you'd find like large
toruses, like galaxy forming,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.900 align:middle line:90%
and quasars and stuff.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:08.799 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:40:08.799 --> 00:40:10.296 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm just wondering.

00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:14.288 align:middle line:84%
William Tifft discovered the
quantization of the redshift.

00:40:14.288 --> 00:40:17.781 align:middle line:84%
Does that relate to the
polarizing structures,

00:40:17.781 --> 00:40:22.790 align:middle line:84%
some sort of intelligent
information that--

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:27.796 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean the polarization
of the light, the redshift?

00:40:27.796 --> 00:40:30.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's the energy
state [INAUDIBLE] continuous.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.440 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.660 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and it might be a
good equation to write.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.800 align:middle line:84%
I have not looked
at it in details.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.090 align:middle line:10%
But if you can imagine you
have like a large torus,

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:10%
like the whole
universe in the sand,

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.990 align:middle line:10%
but then you have smaller
toruses, like quasars,

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.960 align:middle line:10%
and galaxies, and all
this stuff is forming,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:41:01.720 align:middle line:10%
and then smaller ones
forming like planets,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:09.230 align:middle line:10%
like the magnetic field of our
planet being a toroidal field,

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:16.100 align:middle line:10%
and you get smaller and
smaller dynamics of the field

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.510 align:middle line:10%
information, but one
thing that you would see

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.140 align:middle line:10%
is that on the surface
of these boundaries,

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.200 align:middle line:10%
you would see the exchange
of the information that's

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.180 align:middle line:10%
happening.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And where there is
exchange of information,

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:36.050 align:middle line:84%
there would be
structure that would--

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the little torus protons
would make structure,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.540 align:middle line:84%
like hairs on the surface
of the event horizon,

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:84%
like strings would come out,
self-organized-- you guys

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.020 align:middle line:90%
are following me?

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the equation is
the exchange of information

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.470 align:middle line:90%
from the inside to the outside.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So when we look closer,
and closer, and closer

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:13.190 align:middle line:84%
to the surface, we should
start seeing structure.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And then the structure would
be very much along the vector

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:25.400 align:middle line:10%
forces from the center of
the structure to the outside,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.830 align:middle line:10%
like little light rays
coming off the thing.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Like the light rays of
the sun, like, literally.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So that, you can think of
the thermodynamic exchange

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.880 align:middle line:84%
of the sun with
the space around it

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.935 align:middle line:90%
as this information transfer.

00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:90%


00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to give you
an analogy to your body.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Your body is a
carnal engine running

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:56.460 align:middle line:90%
at about 100 Fahrenheit--

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:02.640 align:middle line:84%
96, whatever Fahrenheit--
continuously for 100 years,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.700 align:middle line:84%
if you do good and don't
eat too much McDonald's.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a lot of energy.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.640 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of energy.

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as
like the light rays.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:84%
So think of the light rays
of the sun radiating off

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.480 align:middle line:90%
the surface.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.960 align:middle line:10%
And then think of it
as you radiating off

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.640 align:middle line:10%
the surface of the planet,
like a little light ray.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.430 align:middle line:10%
A little exchange of
information on the surface

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:10%
of the planet, a little dynamic,
a little electromagnetic,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.790 align:middle line:10%
or a little
thermodynamic exchange

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:59.020 align:middle line:10%
that's going on the
surface of the planet.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:00.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting to the C word.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:90%
You're with me?

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.540 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> From what I know, which
is limitlessly small,

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.986 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't seem like there
is any room for error.

00:44:14.986 --> 00:44:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Or is that a crazy
word to use, "error"?

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:21.910 align:middle line:90%
You mean--

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.039 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all kind of--
it's all predetermined.

00:44:25.039 --> 00:44:26.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, I see.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The fluctuation, the
variations, the vibrations,

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to call them,
is it all something we foresee,

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:39.877 align:middle line:84%
and we can hypothesize where
it's going and where it will be

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:43.216 align:middle line:84%
in x amount of time
units, whatever?

00:44:43.216 --> 00:44:44.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.160 align:middle line:84%
the whatever part
is the complex part.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:47.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:90%


00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.990 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.900 align:middle line:84%
That would assume
that we have all

00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.770 align:middle line:84%
of the variables in all
of the scales worked out

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:01.690 align:middle line:90%
in our equation.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Than we could-- yeah.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And knowing exactly the
position and the direction

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:08.780 align:middle line:90%
of an electron.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's uncertainty, because
we don't have all the data.

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:16.570 align:middle line:10%
You see what I'm saying?

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:17.510 align:middle line:90%
But I see.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But your question
is deeper than that.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Your question is,
it deterministic or

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.588 align:middle line:90%
non-deterministic?

00:45:24.588 --> 00:45:25.505 align:middle line:90%
Is that your question?

00:45:25.505 --> 00:45:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> we as human beings are a
total anomaly in this whole

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.630 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:34.820 align:middle line:10%
Actually, us as human
beings are the norm

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.280 align:middle line:10%
in that whole scenario.

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, life must be
emerging everywhere

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:48.230 align:middle line:84%
on most surfaces, like,
non-stop, bubbling out.

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And never mind in our universe.

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, our universe
must be bubbling out,

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.910 align:middle line:84%
like foaming new universes as
protons escape our universe

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and make new ones out there
are all entangled with ours.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And holy shit.

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.955 align:middle line:90%
I mean, seriously.

00:46:07.955 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:84%
The last count on the probable
amount of planets in our galaxy

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:15.470 align:middle line:84%
alone that are in the
golden arc region,

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:18.720 align:middle line:84%
in the region where there
would be life on them--

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.320 align:middle line:84%
they're not too
hot, not too cold--

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.660 align:middle line:90%
is 40 billions.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And this is before we
realized that there

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:84%
is the double of
the stars we thought

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.700 align:middle line:90%
there was in our galaxy.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So when that number
doubled, then it

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:39.500 align:middle line:84%
would be 80 billions planet
which could have life on it

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:40.730 align:middle line:90%
in our galaxy.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.270 align:middle line:10%
In one galaxy-- there's billions
and trillions of galaxies.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.530 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.430 align:middle line:10%
>> All of us in my--

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:51.760 align:middle line:10%
I might have told you, I did
some work with John Hageman.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:54.910 align:middle line:90%
>> So all of this--

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:56.110 align:middle line:90%
>> When you were at--

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] college.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:46:58.335 --> 00:46:59.320 align:middle line:90%
Where was he?

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> He was at Harvard--

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> At Harvard.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:02.846 align:middle line:90%
And you were?

00:47:02.846 --> 00:47:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I was a moron.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:07.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.320 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.096 align:middle line:84%
>> So what [INAUDIBLE] it's
all in our own consciousness,

00:47:14.096 --> 00:47:15.587 align:middle line:90%
all this.

00:47:15.587 --> 00:47:17.037 align:middle line:90%
And it's--

00:47:17.037 --> 00:47:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's the thing.

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good thought.

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't say
what consciousness is,

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:27.240 align:middle line:84%
it just didn't tell me
anything about anything, right?

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And people say
that all the time.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, yeah, I agree.

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.530 align:middle line:84%
But if you won't tell me
what consciousness is,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.810 align:middle line:90%
it's like saying it's all God.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.780 align:middle line:84%
It's about as good
as religion, right?

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't really do us
any good if we don't know--

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's good to
say it's all God, too.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't
tell me what God is,

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.320 align:middle line:84%
then I still don't know
what the heck it is.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:56.130 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to
figure it-- you know,

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.010 align:middle line:84%
to me it's important
to figure it out.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's a new thing to say
it's all consciousness,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:02.610 align:middle line:90%
and it's great.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:06.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really telling
us anything about anything

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to say that.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.840 align:middle line:84%
It would be like
saying it's all mass.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what mass is.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.060 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't
tell us anything.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is,
we have to define that.

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.700 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is that?

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:24.300 align:middle line:84%
So I was at the
little light ray.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.750 align:middle line:84%
Is it deterministic
or non-deterministic?

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to tell
you-- usually when

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.250 align:middle line:84%
you have a choice like that,
it's because it's both.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:37.690 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not that--

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.450 align:middle line:84%
it's deterministic in every
Planck second of the universe.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:50.350 align:middle line:84%
But the synergy of all
Planck seconds advance

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:54.580 align:middle line:84%
in all universes at all
time produces an event

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that is non-deterministic
in any point

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.720 align:middle line:90%
in the deterministic world.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Do you see?

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why there
is uncertainty.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:08.540 align:middle line:84%
That's why you know you
can get superposition.

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:14.520 align:middle line:84%
That's why quantum theory
can run out of that.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:15.720 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense to you?

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Partially.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:90%
But it's ongoing.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ongoing, yes.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:23.312 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] of consciousness,
conscious of x, y, z,

00:49:23.312 --> 00:49:26.730 align:middle line:84%
conscious of whatever it is
in the universe other than

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.440 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
conscious of everything

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.515 align:middle line:84%
else in the universe
seems to be yourself.

00:49:34.515 --> 00:49:38.112 align:middle line:90%


00:49:38.112 --> 00:49:39.820 align:middle line:84%
But that can hurt the
brain a little bit.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:90%
But it's only momentarily.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.880 align:middle line:90%
And then it feels better.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:47.510 align:middle line:90%
But let's keep going.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:55.030 align:middle line:10%
So when you start to
continue to visualize,

00:49:55.030 --> 00:50:01.540 align:middle line:10%
to see that this light ray--

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.860 align:middle line:10%
now, did you see
on the sun there's

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:13.270 align:middle line:10%
some really good telemetry
from Japanese probes there

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:21.420 align:middle line:10%
that are showing the rays
or its solar prominence.

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:25.170 align:middle line:84%
They're magnetic flux that
are spinning out of the sun.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And just to give you
an idea of scale,

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:31.660 align:middle line:84%
when you see this magnetic
flux coming out of the sun,

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.400 align:middle line:90%
you go, wow, that's so cool.

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But you don't realize the
Earth is like a grain of sand

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.190 align:middle line:90%
beside one of those things.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.500 align:middle line:90%
And so they're big.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And then when this magnetic
flux come out that you see

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:49.780 align:middle line:84%
on this telemetry, where the
Earth would be like a little--

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:54.360 align:middle line:84%
more like a pea,
like a little thing--

00:50:54.360 --> 00:51:00.780 align:middle line:84%
you see them like
[WHOOSH] go back in.

00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Usually, especially if there
is sunspots in that region,

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.230 align:middle line:90%
you see them get sucked back in.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that you
have like a flux of information

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:19.005 align:middle line:84%
that's going in these
toroidal dynamics.

00:51:19.005 --> 00:51:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you see when you
look at the plasma in the sun.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:23.580 align:middle line:90%
You see these toroidal dynamics.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
They're going from the
equator to the poles and back

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.790 align:middle line:84%
to the equator,
and the dynamics--

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and you see that in galaxies.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You see stars going from
the center of the galaxy

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to the edge, and the stars go
up in the halo of the galaxy

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:90%
and back down.

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And they go and
they do this thing.

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So now imagine you,
the little light ray,

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.380 align:middle line:84%
the little
thermodynamic structure,

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.400 align:middle line:84%
the little oscillating
biocrystal oscillator

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:58.200 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of your
surface, which is lower energy

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.790 align:middle line:90%
level than the sun--

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.070 align:middle line:84%
there's less
information transfer,

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:08.370 align:middle line:84%
so it's thermodynamically
a little cooler, luckily--

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:12.750 align:middle line:84%
although, if we were made to
run at a temperature of the sun,

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:17.630 align:middle line:84%
we might be little beings with
the temperature of the sun.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It would be cool.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.410 align:middle line:90%
But it'd be hot.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:21.840 align:middle line:90%
But it'd be cool, right?

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.470 align:middle line:90%
But in any case.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.360 align:middle line:90%
Language can get complex.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:33.000 align:middle line:84%
But you can imagine that
this information transfer

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.610 align:middle line:90%
is occurring inside of you.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're exchanging
with the field.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:41.280 align:middle line:84%
You're exchanging with
the field outside of you.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But the field is compressed
inside of you as well.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Because, remember,
each of the proton

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.960 align:middle line:84%
has all of the
energy information

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.230 align:middle line:90%
of all of the universe.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:52.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's exchanging.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Whether you know it or
not, it's exchanging.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The volumes of every proton
in your body is exchanging.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So if it's exchanging,
it's got to go somewhere.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'd explode,
which wouldn't be good.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.040 align:middle line:90%
You would be having a bad day.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:14.710 align:middle line:84%
If all of a sudden, you
were not exchanging at all

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:19.090 align:middle line:84%
with the rest the
universe, and your proton

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:24.730 align:middle line:84%
continued to exchange, there
would be some blockage.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:28.160 align:middle line:84%
That would be
really, really bad.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And there would be like
a thermonuclear explosion

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.230 align:middle line:84%
from which you
would be the center.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And it would make
a really bad mess.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:90%


00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:46.690 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
continuous exchange.

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this rate of
exchange is high.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:56.030 align:middle line:10%
Because it's a hundred trillion
cells by a hundred trillion

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.830 align:middle line:10%
protons.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So at the scale
of the cells, it's

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:07.160 align:middle line:84%
a thousand billion billion
chemical changes every second.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.120 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.150 align:middle line:90%
That is the exchange rate.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:20.750 align:middle line:84%
So here I'm doing something
very, very, very--

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:24.190 align:middle line:90%
how would you say, heretic.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually reversing
the concepts of biology.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I am saying, chemical
activity in the body

00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:38.480 align:middle line:84%
is not the source
of organization.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:47.072 align:middle line:10%
It's the result of information
transfer from the atomic scale.

00:54:47.072 --> 00:54:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not because--
because guess what?

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Currently-- and William,
am I correct about this--

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the standard model
in biology, they

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.790 align:middle line:84%
say that it's happening
because shit is bumping

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.390 align:middle line:90%
against each other, right?

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is some began
see the error of that way

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:09.270 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's still generally
taught that things are bumping

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:15.640 align:middle line:90%
into each other randomly.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the overall model.

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So things are bumping
into each other randomly,

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and they just happen to randomly
doing exactly the right thing

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:84%
exactly at the right time a
thousand billion billion times

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.960 align:middle line:90%
every second.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And if they just
happen to bump a little

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.600 align:middle line:84%
wrong for a few
seconds, you'd, again,

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.650 align:middle line:90%
be having a really bad day.

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I was saying the [INAUDIBLE]
for the room for error is just

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:59.280 align:middle line:84%
where of some kind of
explosion or some magnificent

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:03.751 align:middle line:90%
There is no room for error.

00:56:03.751 --> 00:56:06.136 align:middle line:90%
>> Think about synthesizing DNA.

00:56:06.136 --> 00:56:08.998 align:middle line:84%
The polymerase
will make a new DNA

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.175 align:middle line:84%
strand it will lay
down a thousand

00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:13.910 align:middle line:90%
nucleotides [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:15.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's getting
those nucleotides

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:20.196 align:middle line:84%
from the surrounding A, C,
G, T. There's four of them.

00:56:20.196 --> 00:56:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It has to get the
exact right nucleotide

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.810 align:middle line:84%
to match up with those base
pairs, cognitive base pairs.

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.825 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
those are randomly

00:56:29.825 --> 00:56:33.630 align:middle line:84%
bumping into the polymerase, and
it's getting just the right one

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:37.215 align:middle line:84%
at just the right time to be
able to synthesize a thousand

00:56:37.215 --> 00:56:39.075 align:middle line:90%
nucleotides in one second.

00:56:39.075 --> 00:56:41.540 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it doesn't
add up at all.

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:42.340 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I guess for the people out
there in the non-local universe,

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:53.890 align:middle line:84%
it would be best if you had
a mic when you're talking.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:56.920 align:middle line:84%
But you think you guys
picked that up over there?

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.850 align:middle line:90%


00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:01.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:04.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll try to do that
better next time.

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:07.780 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that all
this is happening

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.650 align:middle line:84%
by stuff bumping into
each other randomly,

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:16.370 align:middle line:84%
let's just say the likelihood is
really, really, really, really,

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.420 align:middle line:90%
really, really, really low.

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not about that
the universe would randomly

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.450 align:middle line:90%
make one cell--

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:28.600 align:middle line:84%
which is already
an amazing thing,

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because a cell is
super complex--

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and the fact that in 13.7
billion years in space

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:38.410 align:middle line:84%
just happened to bump into
each other just right,

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:42.400 align:middle line:84%
so a hundred trillion
atoms just made one cell,

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.560 align:middle line:90%
is pretty damn low.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.320 align:middle line:90%
That already is pretty damn low.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And that cell would be made,
and like, oh [MUTED],, you know,

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.376 align:middle line:90%
a rock fell on it.

00:57:54.376 --> 00:58:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And like, oh, no, another
13 billion years, right?

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And so this idea that
this is all happening--

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.860 align:middle line:90%
so now if it's not random--

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.190 align:middle line:84%
the problem in science is
that science was developed

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:15.850 align:middle line:90%
to separate from religion.

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So it was critical
for science to be

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:26.380 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with a different
model than "God is doing it."

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And the only other thing
they could come up with

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.050 align:middle line:84%
is it's random, it
just happened to bump

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.890 align:middle line:90%
into each other just right.

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
want to go back to

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.760 align:middle line:84%
"it's not random,"
because that wouldn't mean

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.170 align:middle line:90%
they're going back to religion.

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So it's like [GASPS] no way.

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.120 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:48.510 align:middle line:90%
It's random, no matter what.

00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I know the equations
don't add up.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.780 align:middle line:90%
But don't worry about that.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.350 align:middle line:90%


00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:00.037 align:middle line:84%
>> In the fiction of isolated
system helps solve that

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:00.940 align:middle line:90%
cognitive dissonance.

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.980 align:middle line:84%
The fiction of isolated
systems, exactly.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:10.750 align:middle line:84%
It helps us very much in
staying in the illusion.

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Right, very much.

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Both in physics and biology.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's certainly--

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:20.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys think we're
going in the right direction?

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping this is
interesting to you.

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:36.250 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going through more
of the details of the thoughts.

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:37.960 align:middle line:90%
These are really good thoughts.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I hope you can
retain some of them.

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Because they say something very
fundamental about who you are

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and how you're interacting
with the world.

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I know I'm throwing
a lot of stuff at you.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's not necessarily
obvious to retain them.

00:59:54.760 --> 01:00:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But I know that they go in there
in your information exchange

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.840 align:middle line:84%
thing, and they're going to go
through the cycles of exchange

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.250 align:middle line:90%
and come back.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:09.100 align:middle line:90%
So don't panic.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:18.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you think of this dynamic
now from the proton exchanging

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.190 align:middle line:84%
information at the
molecular level,

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
the molecules come
together and link together,

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:25.960 align:middle line:84%
because they're
exchanging information.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The bond angle, the
Van der Waals force,

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.400 align:middle line:84%
is actually the
exchange of information.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it's exchanged
together to produce cells.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the cells
exchange together,

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
all using this quantum
oscillator of the field.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:54.100 align:middle line:84%
This is why your toe is not
confused with your nose.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
And you don't start growing
nose cells on your toe.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Because if you did, it
would be uncomfortable.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:05.466 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:01:05.466 --> 01:01:05.942 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very critical.

01:01:05.942 --> 01:01:07.342 align:middle line:90%
Can you just say this again?

01:01:07.342 --> 01:01:08.800 align:middle line:84%
The quantum
oscillators [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:14.830 align:middle line:84%
So imagine the quantum field,
these Planck oscillators,

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.630 align:middle line:90%
they're making up your protons.

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're protons
are exchanging.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And the electron is the
result of the exchange.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And now you have information.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And then information exchange
happened between the atoms,

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:34.630 align:middle line:84%
because they start to link
up in the molecular scale.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So you start to
get the biochemistry.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:38.950 align:middle line:90%
You start to get biochemistry.

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So now what I'm saying is the
biochemistry in your bodies

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:45.450 align:middle line:90%
inform from the field.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:46.330 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:50.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not just bumping
into each other randomly.

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.420 align:middle line:90%
It's coordinated by the field.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.700 align:middle line:84%
The field knows
where everything is.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
So it knows what to
bump into each other

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
to get the right chemical.

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would mean that
chemistry in your body

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
is driven by the
information transfer

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.890 align:middle line:84%
at the field level
of the Planck scale

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
which happens to be
your consciousness.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.460 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:19.960 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.022 align:middle line:90%
You like that?

01:02:22.022 --> 01:02:23.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Wait, wait, wait, Nassim.

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There seems to be an
intent behind all of this.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And intent, yes.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> An intent.

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:33.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I would agree.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.412 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:34.412 --> 01:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> There must be an
intent behind this.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.280 align:middle line:90%
Like a goal, like a direction.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.510 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.560 align:middle line:90%
OK, we'll get to that.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.643 align:middle line:90%
>> There's smoothing over.

01:02:45.643 --> 01:02:47.127 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
distinction.

01:02:47.127 --> 01:02:50.049 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness
doesn't know anything

01:02:50.049 --> 01:02:52.484 align:middle line:84%
about how to put all
the right [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:52.484 --> 01:02:54.919 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness is
this very small thing.

01:02:54.919 --> 01:02:56.699 align:middle line:84%
When you're talking
about the subconscious

01:02:56.699 --> 01:02:58.116 align:middle line:84%
and the superconscious
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:58.116 --> 01:02:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:01.450 align:middle line:90%
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Because we have this linguistic
issue with consciousness,

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.110 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Because we call the
subconscious that

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
takes care of all this shit
"unconscious," "subconscious."

01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we call the part
that's going around going,

01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:25.000 align:middle line:90%
"What the fuck is this?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.670 align:middle line:90%
How did I get here?

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.740 align:middle line:90%
What is this world?

01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.860 align:middle line:90%
This is not my beautiful wife.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This isn't on my
beautiful house."

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) As the wheels
go on, na, na, na, na, na.

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:03:40.810 --> 01:03:48.070 align:middle line:10%
And so this is a
little flipped around.

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
That part should be
called the unconscious.

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And the part that's
running the show

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
should be called the
conscious, the conscious part.

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So then you have the information
flowing from the Planck field

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
to the atomic level to
this molecular level.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The chemistry produce the
biological relationship.

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
And the information
is exchanged.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:18.510 align:middle line:84%
And if the information
gets impeded there,

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
then the biology might
start doing goofy stuff.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully, it
stays coherent.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:30.270 align:middle line:10%
And in there, in the
scale relationship

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:38.520 align:middle line:10%
between the biology, between
the scale of the molecules

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:42.040 align:middle line:10%
and the scale of the
cell, there is one really,

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.100 align:middle line:10%
really important step.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
molecule of water.

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Because that is the
fundamental transducer,

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
crystal transducer,

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.490 align:middle line:84%
that allows the
information to go through.

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This is why all of life
emerged from water.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come
out of other stuff.

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
It comes out of water.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Like, you put the little
minerals in water,

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.340 align:middle line:90%
and eventually you get life.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
information-- so the water

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:22.050 align:middle line:90%
molecule is super important.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Water is not just
a neutral medium

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that DNA just happened
to hang out in.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
If you take the water
out, DNA falls apart.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It stops working.

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.170 align:middle line:90%
That's correct?

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.090 align:middle line:90%
And then lately, we found--

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
do we have another
mic in the room?

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.860 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that would be great.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we can give it
to William for now.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.290 align:middle line:90%
Could have gone to Johanna.

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:57.790 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get to it.

01:05:57.790 --> 01:06:00.920 align:middle line:90%


01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.330 align:middle line:90%
We all have to learn German.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.350 align:middle line:90%
No, English is good.

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
So what happens, lately
when we've looked that water

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:14.350 align:middle line:90%
in the vicinity of DNA--

01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.650 align:middle line:84%
I hope you know
where I'm leading.

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so what has been found
is that you can actually read

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the nucleotide sequence of DNA
from the structure of water

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:30.830 align:middle line:90%
around it.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So they actually say that
DNA has a chiral water

01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
superstructure that's
along the entire periphery.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the water is
functioning as the intermediary

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
between the enzymes
that read and process

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.990 align:middle line:90%
the information in the DNA.

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And the DNA that is the
reservoir of that information.

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Without water, there is no
information transmission.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't get the
hereditary information of life

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
expressed, you don't have life.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So just immediately
right there, you

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
see that the critical
component in this

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
is the information
transmission being

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.470 align:middle line:84%
mediated by the water chiral
superstructure around the DNA.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.270 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just the DNA.

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Water does this around
almost every biomolecule.

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And so there's also
long range communication

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.610 align:middle line:10%
between biomolecules
via the water.

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.100 align:middle line:10%
>> Non-linear relationships.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.530 align:middle line:84%
They're finding non-linear
relationships in the brain

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:46.080 align:middle line:90%
just lately a few weeks ago.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But as well, we're
seeing that the water

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
is modulating the DNA.

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
So they've done femtosecond
ultrafast laser spectroscopy

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of DNA interacting with
the various enzymes that

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
bring out the information in
the DNA, like the polymerases.

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:10.820 align:middle line:84%
These are very
important ones for that.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what they found is the
way that the polymerase is

01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
actually able to access the
information in the DNA molecule

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.180 align:middle line:90%
is via the water intermediary.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Because it's almost like the
polymerase, or the enzyme

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that's going to read the
information in the DNA

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.290 align:middle line:84%
and express it, doesn't
even necessarily

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:40.700 align:middle line:84%
need to directly be in
contact with the DNA strand.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Because there's always
going to be a layer

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:47.180 align:middle line:90%
of structured water between it.

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And that key word
there is structured water.

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That is, if the water
loses its structure,

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
then the transfer
of information,

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:04.250 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of the system to
oscillate, breaks down, right?

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:05.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.529 align:middle line:84%
So structured water is
really, really important

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:11.479 align:middle line:90%
for where we're getting to--

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
how much time do I have?

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm running out of time already.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.979 align:middle line:90%
Is that crazy or what?

01:09:15.979 --> 01:09:19.520 align:middle line:90%
How long have I been going?

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got another hour?

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.600 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:22.705 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

01:09:22.705 --> 01:09:25.586 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:09:25.586 --> 01:09:26.578 align:middle line:90%
>> An hour and 10.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.970 align:middle line:90%
An hour and 10 minutes.

01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:28.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry?

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:29.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Hour and 10 minutes.

01:09:29.728 --> 01:09:30.689 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:33.615 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to define a
little bit structured water?

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to go in
too much detail right now.

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.849 align:middle line:90%
I'll get back to it.

01:09:39.849 --> 01:09:40.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, and just to
follow up, the studies,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the research that has been
done is showing the importance

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
of water in not only
the functionality of DNA

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:54.090 align:middle line:84%
but also its
structural integrity,

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
so how it's held together.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.710 align:middle line:10%
And this has all kinds of
important factors in how

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:04.350 align:middle line:10%
the information is expressed.

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:09.210 align:middle line:10%
In terms of
structured water, it's

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:13.980 align:middle line:10%
pretty well-defined,
pretty well-known,

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:21.090 align:middle line:10%
how water will form a
very specific geometry

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:24.750 align:middle line:10%
at interfacial surfaces.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the living cell is full
of interfacial surfaces--

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
the plasma membrane, the
long polymer-type molecules,

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.450 align:middle line:90%
the microtubules, mitochondria.

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:39.990 align:middle line:10%
There's tons of these
interfacial surfaces

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:45.300 align:middle line:10%
where you have molecules that
like to interact with DNA--

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.650 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, with water.

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:49.720 align:middle line:10%
And the water likes to
interact with these molecules.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:55.620 align:middle line:10%
And so they form a
unique organization

01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.470 align:middle line:10%
which is a structural geometry.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:03.870 align:middle line:10%
And so although
this is well-known,

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:07.860 align:middle line:10%
it was thought it's
at the interface,

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.640 align:middle line:10%
and it's just a
few water molecules

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.540 align:middle line:10%
that get ordered by
the biomolecules.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:17.200 align:middle line:10%
But then you have work
by like Gerald Pollack--

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.970 align:middle line:10%
university professor up at
the University of Washington.

01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:26.640 align:middle line:10%
We actually presented at
his conference, the water

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.440 align:middle line:10%
conference.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.815 align:middle line:84%
We presented some
of the research

01:11:28.815 --> 01:11:31.080 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing on water.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But he's shown that, in fact,
this structured or organized

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:43.960 align:middle line:84%
water extends for hundreds and
hundreds of water molecules

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.420 align:middle line:90%
above the interfacial surface.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is a long range
ordering of the water molecule.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:12:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because, I mean, in
some cases you can see it.

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:03.340 align:middle line:10%
So it's in the millimeter
range, which, that's

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.190 align:middle line:10%
millions of water molecules.

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And so the structured
water is a liquid crystal.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:19.990 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is just
a solid is something

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:23.830 align:middle line:10%
that has locked into a very
specific geometric pattern,

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:28.360 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't budge, unless
you melt it and becomes a fluid.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.420 align:middle line:10%
And then the organization
of the molecules

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:35.560 align:middle line:10%
are a little bit more
erratic, random, seemingly.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.790 align:middle line:10%
So the water is becoming more
like a solid in structured

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:40.750 align:middle line:10%
water.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:46.030 align:middle line:10%
So because of that,
the structured water

01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:51.130 align:middle line:10%
around the interfacial
membranes of the living cells

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:56.260 align:middle line:10%
can exclude a good
number of molecules

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.240 align:middle line:10%
from coming in or leaving.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:00.910 align:middle line:10%
So it can regulate,
again, the information

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:05.030 align:middle line:10%
transmission of what molecules
are coming in and coming out.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%
So actually--

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like I was telling
you, on the horizon,

01:13:09.310 --> 01:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
information exchange occurs
at the biological level.

01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:14.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the same.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.620 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:16.420 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like an almost perfect
analogy with the event horizon

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.240 align:middle line:90%
exchange.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:23.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I ask a few questions?

01:13:23.731 --> 01:13:26.713 align:middle line:84%
So you're saying there's a
chiral water superstructure.

01:13:26.713 --> 01:13:28.701 align:middle line:84%
So is that normal
water molecule sitting

01:13:28.701 --> 01:13:30.937 align:middle line:84%
around the DNA which
is part of shaping it

01:13:30.937 --> 01:13:36.156 align:middle line:84%
into a sacred geometry,
and then injecting that?

01:13:36.156 --> 01:13:38.641 align:middle line:84%
Is that what the chiral
water superstructure is?

01:13:38.641 --> 01:13:42.617 align:middle line:90%
Or is it free in the structure?

01:13:42.617 --> 01:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Is it reading the structure
of the DNA [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's a good question.

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:53.530 align:middle line:10%
I mean, because the way that
the researchers interpret

01:13:53.530 --> 01:14:02.620 align:middle line:10%
it is what's occurring is in
the intercellular fluid medium,

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.500 align:middle line:10%
the water is more random.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:05.590 align:middle line:10%
It's bulk water.

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:08.230 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have any
structure or organization.

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:10.510 align:middle line:10%
Which is probably false.

01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:14.530 align:middle line:10%
But then along the
DNA molecule, it

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:18.620 align:middle line:10%
forms very specific
structural organization,

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.710 align:middle line:10%
a very specific pattern.

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And their perspective
would be that that

01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
is being patterned via
the interaction of the DNA

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.440 align:middle line:90%
on the water molecule.

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:35.530 align:middle line:10%
Because the phosphate
backbone, the DNA,

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:38.590 align:middle line:10%
is just extremely
electronegative.

01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:41.340 align:middle line:10%
So it's got all these
charges along the backbone,

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and water loves that.

01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
So they are very
hydrophilic, in essence.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
But then the question
becomes, well,

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
maybe this structured water
is what is ordering the DNA.

01:14:57.570 --> 01:15:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And there some
research to show there.

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Clearly that's the case.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:06.665 align:middle line:84%
Because if you remove the water,
the DNA loses its structure.

01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:07.465 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:15:07.465 --> 01:15:09.298 align:middle line:84%
So we have all this
exchange of information.

01:15:09.298 --> 01:15:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.710 align:middle line:90%
You're trying-- yes.

01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:13.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.122 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, William.

01:15:15.122 --> 01:15:17.900 align:middle line:90%


01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And you get the sense
that that's happening

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:24.790 align:middle line:90%
when you find a guy like this.

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:27.645 align:middle line:90%
Like, this guy is a French guy.

01:15:27.645 --> 01:15:29.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.390 align:middle line:90%
Sorry, Olivier.

01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
i had to go there.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:35.230 align:middle line:90%


01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
He was in a car accident
a few years ago.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is not such
an unusual incidence.

01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And he got an MRI and
X-ray of the skull,

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:56.050 align:middle line:84%
because he had
injuries on his head,

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:57.850 align:middle line:90%
just to make sure he was OK.

01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you
can imagine the guy.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
He's in bed, he's having a bad
day, he was in an accident,

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:05.470 align:middle line:90%
and all this.

01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctor goes, I
have good news and bad news.

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:13.810 align:middle line:90%
You're good, no problem.

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:14.890 align:middle line:90%
But you have no brain.

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:18.440 align:middle line:90%


01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And the guy is
like, oh, thank god.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:24.220 align:middle line:90%
I could have bruised it.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:26.740 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:30.760 align:middle line:90%
So this is not so uncommon.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
People are found that they
are functioning absolutely

01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
normally, but they mostly
have water in the noggin,

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:43.252 align:middle line:84%
not so much gray matter,
not so much brain.

01:16:43.252 --> 01:16:50.530 align:middle line:84%
And that is the result
of, in some cases,

01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:55.550 align:middle line:84%
meningitis in early stages, and
various viruses that basically

01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:58.570 align:middle line:84%
eat your brain
out, and whatever,

01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:00.100 align:middle line:90%
or they're born that way.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessarily clear.

01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:04.630 align:middle line:84%
But for sure,
they're functioning

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:08.320 align:middle line:84%
like a normal human being,
and they have, in this case,

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.290 align:middle line:90%
like basically--

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
these keep changing-- his brain
is literally that little bump

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:16.360 align:middle line:90%
in the middle there.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.490 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat less than
10% of the whole thing.

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, this is telling
you something about water

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
that's very important, is that
the information transfer is

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.550 align:middle line:90%
through the water molecule.

01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Since life emerged
out of water, I

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:40.540 align:middle line:84%
would tend to say that
water comes first.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to give
you an idea of scale

01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:46.630 align:middle line:84%
as well, because
people think about DNA,

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and they think of this little
strand that they all get shown,

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
this little pairs of protein
that makes up the DNA

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
strand, that most
people get shown,

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:07.420 align:middle line:84%
they don't realize that
that's just one sequence,

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and there is 2 meters of
that stuff in each nuclei

01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:17.260 align:middle line:90%
of every cell, approximately.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So just so you know, because we
have a tendency to think about

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
biology as this low
kind of Mobius-like,

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:30.160 align:middle line:90%
kind of like an amoeba--

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.670 align:middle line:84%
not a Mobius-- but an amoeba
kind of thing that's slow.

01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not slow.

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.680 align:middle line:90%
It's very dynamic.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very energetic.

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's seriously producing
insane amount of energy.

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take all
the DNA in one human being,

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:56.530 align:middle line:84%
you can wrap it around
the world 5 million times.

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:59.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's non-trivial.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You can go from Jupiter
to the sun six times.

01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
You're going back and forth with
the DNA that's inside your body

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.510 align:middle line:90%
right now.

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
It's non-trivial amount
of information exchange.

01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:17.710 align:middle line:10%
So we have a
tendency-- and that's

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:22.180 align:middle line:10%
really why some
analogy breaks down,

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:24.850 align:middle line:10%
is that we have a
tendency to break things

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:29.050 align:middle line:10%
in such small pieces and then
try to analyze how they work.

01:19:29.050 --> 01:19:32.830 align:middle line:10%
And we miss the global
collective behavior,

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:35.620 align:middle line:10%
which is completely insane.

01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:41.080 align:middle line:10%
Imagine DNA from here
to Jupiter six time

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.010 align:middle line:10%
exchanging information
in your body,

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:51.370 align:middle line:10%
and then ATP production
through the mitochondria

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:55.360 align:middle line:10%
doing its thing, where each
one is like billions of them

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.070 align:middle line:10%
on the surface exchanging,
producing ATP--

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:04.690 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's like
the life force, ATP.

01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, it's the energy
production of your body.

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, it does that.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you wake
up and stay in bed--

01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:22.640 align:middle line:84%
just like that, all day, you do
nothing, you just do nothing--

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
you will produce approximately
your body weight in ATP

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
during that day.

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The little motor
inside the mitochondria

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.700 align:middle line:84%
is spinning at
6,000 to 8,000 RPM.

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a little magnetic
motor in there going [WHINES]

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.830 align:middle line:90%
There's billions of those.

01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
They're ripping electrons out.

01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And from the--

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm simplifying.

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Johanna is going to kick my
ass if I keep doing that.

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:54.740 align:middle line:90%


01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:58.040 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, it's
doing this whole thing.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:00.710 align:middle line:10%
During that day, instead
of staying in bed

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.080 align:middle line:10%
if you go and run
a marathon, you

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:12.770 align:middle line:10%
will produce approximately 1
ton of ATP during that day.

01:21:12.770 --> 01:21:14.150 align:middle line:10%
That's what you're going to do.

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And so it's non-trivial
energy factory dynamics,

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.850 align:middle line:10%
exchange of information.

01:21:23.850 --> 01:21:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I just want to--

01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:29.800 align:middle line:84%
so imagine it's that high
at a hundred trillion cells

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how high it is at
a hundred trillion atoms

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:37.070 align:middle line:90%
in each one of the cells.

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And then you start to see,
when you guys integrate this,

01:21:41.850 --> 01:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
you start to see the
light body that you are.

01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You're literally an
electromagnetic inductor

01:21:57.770 --> 01:22:01.520 align:middle line:84%
bio-oscillator
crystal resonating,

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
and, like, you know
[VOCALIZES] and you're

01:22:05.210 --> 01:22:09.470 align:middle line:84%
running at 100 Fahrenheit
for like a hundred years.

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:18.080 align:middle line:90%


01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so this dynamic
of organization,

01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:27.250 align:middle line:84%
from the Planck field into
the atoms, into the cell,

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
into the energy transfer,
and all this stuff that's

01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:35.000 align:middle line:84%
happening, eventually
creates complexities

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that are super high-- very
highly complex systems,

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:42.730 align:middle line:90%
self-supporting systems.

01:22:42.730 --> 01:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like making a liver,
and it's making a heart,

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's making a brain to try
to coordinate all this stuff.

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:55.660 align:middle line:10%
And it's making nerves
and all kinds of stuff

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:59.360 align:middle line:10%
to communicate across scales,
and making sure everything

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.160 align:middle line:10%
is going.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it builds this
more, and more, and more,

01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and more complex system
that gets super complex,

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.460 align:middle line:84%
until the complexity
is high enough

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that this system reaches
like a threshold where

01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:25.180 align:middle line:84%
the feedback structure of
spacetime becomes self-aware.

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:30.540 align:middle line:90%
The feedback goes, I am here.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the
universe is over there.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And there lies the possibility
for massive confusion.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:23:46.710 --> 01:23:52.830 align:middle line:10%
All along the way, you
have perfect organization.

01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:54.240 align:middle line:90%
You're doing great.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And everything is highly
coordinated, there's perfect--

01:23:58.190 --> 01:23:59.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look at nature.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not confused.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else in nature is quite
as confused as the human being.

01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:09.870 align:middle line:90%


01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:13.590 align:middle line:84%
They're not sitting
there going, should I

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:middle line:90%
get the nectar from this plant?

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:25.760 align:middle line:10%
Should I-- what does it mean
that this flower is yellow?

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.820 align:middle line:90%
oh

01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's not confused.

01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:41.970 align:middle line:10%
It's not saying-- there is
this sense of natural order.

01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:44.430 align:middle line:90%
That's there, and it's running.

01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
to the human being,

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and it's utterly confused.

01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:57.090 align:middle line:84%
But what really blew my
mind is that, although it's

01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
utterly confused about
the whole experience,

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
it acts like it knows
what it's doing.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait a minute.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole rest of the
universe is looking.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd better know what
the heck I'm doing.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.150 align:middle line:90%
This could be embarrassing.

01:25:19.150 --> 01:25:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So that threshold
produced that separation.

01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:34.510 align:middle line:10%
From the being all of a sudden
becoming aware of itself--

01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:37.840 align:middle line:10%
it looks in the mirror,
and now the feedback

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.230 align:middle line:10%
is like, that's me--

01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:44.520 align:middle line:10%
from this, it can
assume that there

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.640 align:middle line:10%
is no direct relationship
between that feedback

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.600 align:middle line:10%
and the rest of the universe.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:57.330 align:middle line:10%
It can assume that somehow
it's separated from what

01:25:57.330 --> 01:26:01.020 align:middle line:10%
was the insertion of
its own existence.

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.511 align:middle line:90%


01:26:04.511 --> 01:26:09.300 align:middle line:84%
The life force and the flow of
all information that eventually

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:17.120 align:middle line:84%
makes it becomes
something mysterious

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that is unclear to
the resulting effect.

01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the effect
of information.

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:31.100 align:middle line:84%
But that effect
is unclear what is

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.630 align:middle line:90%
the source of their existence.

01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Never mind the purpose.

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:40.550 align:middle line:90%


01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.820 align:middle line:90%
How the heck did I get here?

01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:47.300 align:middle line:90%


01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:49.910 align:middle line:10%
And that's what really freaked
me out when I was a kid.

01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:50.900 align:middle line:90%
You know, it was like--

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.230 align:middle line:90%


01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:55.430 align:middle line:90%
I mean it literally.

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I used to just sit--

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:04.610 align:middle line:84%
yesterday, I met with a book
publisher owner, [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:13.340 align:middle line:10%
which is a large publisher
for the French cultures

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.270 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And he's a Quebecker, and
he lived across from me

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.360 align:middle line:10%
in Montreal when I was a child.

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We didn't know each other,
but he lived literally across

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.830 align:middle line:90%
from me.

01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:30.250 align:middle line:84%
He knew exactly which
building I was in.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And right beside my
building was a theater.

01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And I would sit in front--

01:27:39.230 --> 01:27:41.360 align:middle line:90%
that was a bench there.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I would sit in
front of that theater

01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:46.240 align:middle line:90%
and see people come out.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.020 align:middle line:90%
And I would observe people.

01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:50.450 align:middle line:84%
I would observe how they
act, and how they connect.

01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.730 align:middle line:90%
And I was classifying.

01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:54.570 align:middle line:90%
I was making classifications.

01:27:54.570 --> 01:27:56.270 align:middle line:90%
I was looking for patterns.

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would say this
person is more like this.

01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And this person,
the way they walk,

01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
the way they talk,
the way they look.

01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was looking for
like the fractal branches

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.190 align:middle line:90%
of their existence.

01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking, you
know, but I was puzzled.

01:28:14.270 --> 01:28:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Like, none of them were thinking
like, how did I get here?

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it wasn't apparent.

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe internally
it was happening.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe internally there was
a thing that was going,

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:31.010 align:middle line:84%
what the heck is
happening over here?

01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:35.270 align:middle line:84%
But externally, there
was this facade.

01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:39.870 align:middle line:10%
And I was like, how
is this possible?

01:28:39.870 --> 01:28:42.740 align:middle line:84%
How is this possible
that you get here,

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:45.895 align:middle line:84%
and you're somehow
conscious, and it's like--

01:28:45.895 --> 01:28:48.530 align:middle line:90%


01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:51.140 align:middle line:84%
and you don't ask
the first question,

01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:56.750 align:middle line:84%
like, how did I get here,
and what is this zoo?

01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:59.793 align:middle line:10%
But people get in the thing,
because everybody tells them

01:28:59.793 --> 01:29:00.710 align:middle line:10%
you've got to do this.

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:03.320 align:middle line:90%
So then they do this.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe at the
end of their life,

01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:11.830 align:middle line:84%
maybe in the last few weeks
or in the last few minutes

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:17.420 align:middle line:84%
for most of them, they
might go, what was all this?

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:19.580 align:middle line:90%
What was I doing?

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And so there, the
boundary, the separation

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:33.180 align:middle line:10%
occurs, at that point where
the system becomes self-aware.

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Because the loop closes.

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.810 align:middle line:90%
The loop closes on itself.

01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it assumes
that the source

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:46.830 align:middle line:90%
is itself, which is correct.

01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Except that itself
is the whole thing.

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.310 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't know that.

01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:56.090 align:middle line:90%


01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.760 align:middle line:90%
You see what I'm saying?

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, it doesn't know
where is the plug,

01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:04.360 align:middle line:90%
where is the data coming from.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So then it goes, what
is consciousness?

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.560 align:middle line:90%


01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, eventually,
it gets to the idea--

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.150 align:middle line:90%
you know, it's writing physics.

01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing this,
and it's doing that.

01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time
it goes, we don't

01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:21.540 align:middle line:90%
need no stinking consciousness.

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:24.900 align:middle line:90%
We can solve this without it.

01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually, it
goes, wait, I'm conscious.

01:30:29.010 --> 01:30:32.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm solving these equations.

01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So I need me to
solve the equation.

01:30:37.450 --> 01:30:40.830 align:middle line:90%
So where is me in the equation?

01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:45.390 align:middle line:90%


01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So then maybe that species
eventually goes, OK,

01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
so consciousness has got
to be in there somewhere.

01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:56.310 align:middle line:90%


01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.510 align:middle line:90%
So the plug--

01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:58.890 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now--

01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:04.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so-- but you can
get even more confused.

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
writing these equations,

01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:12.870 align:middle line:84%
you might be writing
the equation saying,

01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:16.710 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to
make it easier on me.

01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:19.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
this equation easier.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:22.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to assume that this
thing I'm trying to measure

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.240 align:middle line:10%
is like me.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.470 align:middle line:10%
It's isolated from the system.

01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:31.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to assume
that I'm here,

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:35.610 align:middle line:10%
and I've got nothing
to do with that thing.

01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's there, and it
has nothing to do with me

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:43.750 align:middle line:90%
or the rest of the universe.

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And I can calculate now
how much energy it burns,

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and what it does,
and all this stuff.

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:54.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking I'm accurate.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:57.390 align:middle line:84%
But then that civilization
gets better at doing this.

01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And then when they get really,
really into the details,

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and they get down
there in the quantum

01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
world near that field of
information, near where

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.820 align:middle line:84%
things kind of like
in the equation

01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
they're going on a little
crazy, because it's really

01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:18.540 align:middle line:84%
high intensity energy
and all this stuff--

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:25.630 align:middle line:84%
when they get down there,
they realize whoa, sh-sh-[MUTED]..

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.260 align:middle line:90%
When I look at it, it changes.

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.830 align:middle line:90%
I can't isolate it.

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:37.510 align:middle line:84%
I can't put it there and
measure it without changing it.

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:38.850 align:middle line:90%
What the heck?

01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got this,
uh, it's getting ugly.

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I can't put simple
mechanics on it anymore.

01:32:52.180 --> 01:32:53.140 align:middle line:90%
It's not working.

01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:56.050 align:middle line:90%


01:32:56.050 --> 01:33:00.370 align:middle line:84%
So now this society can
do something very strange.

01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:05.010 align:middle line:10%
They can, like, start
dropping acid then, you know--

01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:09.430 align:middle line:10%
and start thinking, OK, if I
drop enough acid eventually

01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:11.470 align:middle line:10%
I might get this.

01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And then it's like, it
might get into the place--

01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:21.385 align:middle line:84%
now I'm talking about you
know which period of time--

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:24.700 align:middle line:90%


01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that I could maybe
just completely abandon

01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:33.730 align:middle line:84%
all mechanical
system and just say,

01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:37.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do statistics.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:40.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
assume that it's

01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.960 align:middle line:90%
all kind of crazy down there.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to call it
"quantum weirdness."

01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:49.220 align:middle line:90%


01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to abandon
all mechanical function.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
just say, there's

01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:05.630 align:middle line:84%
probabilities that something
may be there or may not.

01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, until
there's a measurement,

01:34:10.090 --> 01:34:14.840 align:middle line:84%
it's in state of superposition,
so it could be anything.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.045 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:34:16.045 --> 01:34:18.220 align:middle line:90%
It could be the whole universe.

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.570 align:middle line:90%
It could be a cat.

01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:21.665 align:middle line:84%
It could be alive,
it could be dead.

01:34:21.665 --> 01:34:28.738 align:middle line:90%


01:34:28.738 --> 01:34:31.510 align:middle line:90%
You've got a big problem now.

01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Now you've got a big problem.

01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:35.870 align:middle line:90%
A big problem.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not
thinking too much--

01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.860 align:middle line:84%
which, you know, if
you drop a lot of acid,

01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:45.160 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to think
the next day--

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:55.090 align:middle line:84%
you can end up
thinking that when

01:34:55.090 --> 01:35:01.510 align:middle line:84%
you do this statistical
approach, when

01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:04.840 align:middle line:90%
you open a cat box--

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
the cat in the box,
Schrodinger's cat--

01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:13.120 align:middle line:84%
when you open the cat
box, it's alive and dead

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.270 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:17.800 align:middle line:10%
It's in state of
superposition in there.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But it is your observation,
your measurement,

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:24.835 align:middle line:90%
that determines its state.

01:35:24.835 --> 01:35:27.830 align:middle line:90%


01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And doing that, you've
closed the system again.

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:36.230 align:middle line:84%
It's you or the
measurement and the cat.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I just want to make clear
that this doesn't say anything

01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:42.730 align:middle line:84%
about consciousness
in standard physics.

01:35:42.730 --> 01:35:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big error
that spiritual people

01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:47.390 align:middle line:90%
do all the time.

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They associate this
equation with proof

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness has
something to do with physics.

01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:56.660 align:middle line:84%
The physicists will
disagree with that,

01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.350 align:middle line:84%
because the equations don't say
anything about consciousness.

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:02.840 align:middle line:84%
They just say a
measurement is taken.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It could be a robot.

01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:06.455 align:middle line:84%
It could be-- you
don't need a person.

01:36:06.455 --> 01:36:12.340 align:middle line:90%


01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But this is a very, very
important conundrum.

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to--

01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to describe it to
you so it doesn't confuse you.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I hope you can follow me.

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying there
is that at that moment,

01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:30.020 align:middle line:84%
you've just close the
loop, and you've, again,

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.120 align:middle line:90%
isolated the system.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.960 align:middle line:10%
Because guess what?

01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.500 align:middle line:84%
The cat in the box
is not isolated

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.210 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the universe.

01:36:40.210 --> 01:36:44.650 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you're confused
about the state of the cat

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:46.960 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean that the
rest of the universe

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:49.270 align:middle line:90%
is confused as well.

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.380 align:middle line:84%
This fact that you don't know
if the cat is alive or dead

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
is really, in some
ways, irrelevant

01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:59.080 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the universe.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It's not because it's in the box
that the universe doesn't know

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.180 align:middle line:90%
what's happening with the cat.

01:37:04.180 --> 01:37:07.060 align:middle line:90%


01:37:07.060 --> 01:37:09.670 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying
it is that you can't

01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:11.880 align:middle line:90%
isolate the frame of reference.

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:13.260 align:middle line:90%
This is a fractional problem.

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:17.350 align:middle line:90%
What about the flea on the cat?

01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:20.930 align:middle line:84%
The flea has its own
experience of the cat.

01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And it knows if
it's alive or dead.

01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:24.430 align:middle line:90%
It's on the cat.

01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:26.950 align:middle line:84%
If the blood doesn't
come out anymore

01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:29.620 align:middle line:84%
when it's sucking
on it, guess what?

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:32.470 align:middle line:90%
It's dead.

01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:35.600 align:middle line:90%
And the flea goes.

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.860 align:middle line:90%
What about the microbes?

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:37.660 align:middle line:90%
You see?

01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:40.153 align:middle line:90%
Which frame are you using?

01:37:40.153 --> 01:37:41.695 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite
amount of frames.

01:37:41.695 --> 01:37:44.820 align:middle line:90%


01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:49.280 align:middle line:84%
So you still can't
get those right.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:53.390 align:middle line:90%


01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Are you guys running out of ATP?

01:37:57.710 --> 01:38:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Are we doing good?

01:38:00.170 --> 01:38:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

01:38:01.190 --> 01:38:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes, very good.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But so basically, now
you've got to go, OK,

01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:10.700 align:middle line:90%
so it's got to be different.

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.110 align:middle line:90%
It's got to be different.

01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:13.370 align:middle line:90%
And what's different?

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:16.790 align:middle line:90%


01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:20.690 align:middle line:90%
So why is it that--

01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:22.460 align:middle line:90%
so what do you do then?

01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:23.880 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do then?

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:25.250 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to backtrack.

01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:27.140 align:middle line:84%
You've got to go,
wait, wait, wait.

01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I missed
something along the way

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:37.280 align:middle line:84%
in which I can start to describe
the relationship of things

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:38.810 align:middle line:90%
relative to each other.

01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Since I can't isolate
them, maybe it's

01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the exchange of everything
in every point that

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:56.030 align:middle line:84%
produces the energy
effect of that point.

01:38:56.030 --> 01:39:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's all connected.

01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So now I can start to look at
my experiments a little bit

01:39:03.650 --> 01:39:05.150 align:middle line:90%
differently.

01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
field of information

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:11.490 align:middle line:84%
connecting everything that
I didn't know was there.

01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:14.190 align:middle line:90%


01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I became
self-aware, because I'm

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:24.060 align:middle line:84%
part of a field of
information that's feeding.

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got, oh,
there's the plug.

01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:32.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm plugged into a field.

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And that field is the exchange
of all things informing

01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:40.080 align:middle line:90%
all other things.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.920 align:middle line:90%


01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:47.540 align:middle line:90%
And so you look for that.

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And if you look--

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:52.380 align:middle line:90%
and that's what I did.

01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:58.120 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the fundamental
particle, the one that

01:39:58.120 --> 01:40:01.690 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the most
stable, the one that

01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:04.600 align:middle line:84%
seems to be at the heart of
what you call the material

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:10.690 align:middle line:84%
world that makes up you,
the proton, which is a mass,

01:40:10.690 --> 01:40:14.560 align:middle line:90%
the mass of atoms, you go, OK.

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So if that's true,
that little guy

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.860 align:middle line:84%
must have evidence of being
in touch with the whole thing.

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
This little guy must be like
the throughput of the data

01:40:28.420 --> 01:40:33.010 align:middle line:84%
streaming across the
nodes of the universe.

01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So then you look into it--

01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:37.790 align:middle line:90%
and I did.

01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And when I did, I found
the mass of the universe.

01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:46.360 align:middle line:84%
All the little Plancks
inside one proton

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.260 align:middle line:90%
equals the mass of the universe.

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Each bit of information
that makes up

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
all the rest of the universe
are present in the field

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.704 align:middle line:84%
of information
within one proton.

01:41:02.704 --> 01:41:03.870 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] holographic.

01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

01:41:04.670 --> 01:41:06.020 align:middle line:90%
It's holographic.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:07.340 align:middle line:90%
It's remarkable.

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:08.450 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why I'm
not measuring the mass

01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:14.150 align:middle line:90%
of the proton when I measure--

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:17.240 align:middle line:84%
the reason why I'm not measuring
the mass of the universe

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
when I measure the
mass of the proton

01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:22.840 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm only
measuring one node.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:23.790 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So that node can
only emit what's

01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:32.690 align:middle line:84%
able to come out of
its little surface.

01:41:32.690 --> 01:41:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But in the center,
in the volume,

01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is the shared volume of
all the other protons,

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.280 align:middle line:84%
because they're all connected
through little Planck

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:46.040 align:middle line:90%
wormholes.

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.440 align:middle line:90%
So the whole thing is connected.

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's like mycelium.

01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:54.470 align:middle line:90%
It's like neurons.

01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:57.230 align:middle line:90%
It's like growing.

01:41:57.230 --> 01:42:00.980 align:middle line:10%
Maybe if they'd dropped more
mushrooms and less acid,

01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:02.930 align:middle line:10%
they would have
gotten there earlier.

01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.442 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:42:07.442 --> 01:42:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Nassim, you refer
to Michael [INAUDIBLE]..

01:42:10.610 --> 01:42:11.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:15.366 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he said the ancients
knew this, what you just said.

01:42:15.366 --> 01:42:16.770 align:middle line:90%
He said the ancients knew it.

01:42:16.770 --> 01:42:17.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:42:17.945 --> 01:42:19.970 align:middle line:90%
It's in all ancient--

01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:22.560 align:middle line:84%
it's in most ancient
civilization.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.850 align:middle line:84%
They called the
field different ways.

01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:28.790 align:middle line:90%
They had mana.

01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:32.170 align:middle line:90%
They had-- what's another one--

01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:34.640 align:middle line:90%
chi-- I'm sorry?

01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Prana.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Prana, chi, all kinds of
different ways of calling

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.960 align:middle line:90%
the field.

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And they describe that field
as a field of information.

01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:48.540 align:middle line:90%
They even said it had structure.

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Then they had symbols to show
the structure of the field.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.320 align:middle line:90%
And then they had--

01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.110 align:middle line:84%
they were describing
very similar things

01:43:00.110 --> 01:43:01.640 align:middle line:90%
that I'm describing right now.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:03.657 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they knew this stuff.

01:43:03.657 --> 01:43:05.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What does the--

01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Why wouldn't they know that?

01:43:08.210 --> 01:43:10.190 align:middle line:90%
Why wouldn't they notice?

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:12.140 align:middle line:90%
This is how you're made.

01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:13.460 align:middle line:90%
It should come out.

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:18.230 align:middle line:10%
If it's true, you should be
able to look back in history

01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:21.320 align:middle line:10%
and see it emerge.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:22.910 align:middle line:90%
You should see it emerge.

01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:29.750 align:middle line:84%
From the highest thinkers
on the planet, the highest

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:33.260 align:middle line:84%
teachers on the planet,
you should see it.

01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You should start to
see the commonality.

01:43:35.690 --> 01:43:39.920 align:middle line:10%
If you put all these great
teachers in history together,

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.000 align:middle line:10%
you should--

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.670 align:middle line:10%
because if that's
the way we're made,

01:43:43.670 --> 01:43:47.330 align:middle line:10%
the information should come out.

01:43:47.330 --> 01:43:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so just by doing an
analysis of ancient history,

01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:58.160 align:middle line:84%
you should find the
thread that would tell you

01:43:58.160 --> 01:43:59.880 align:middle line:90%
the physics of the universe.

01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:02.610 align:middle line:90%
And that is what I did.

01:44:02.610 --> 01:44:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I studied ancient civilizations
in parallel to physics

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.420 align:middle line:84%
so that I could get the
clues along the way.

01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
decode these symbols,

01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and I found the
geometry emerging.

01:44:17.210 --> 01:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
I wrote the equations

01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:23.150 align:middle line:84%
that confirmed that that
was the correct geometry.

01:44:23.150 --> 01:44:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when it
all came out right.

01:44:25.670 --> 01:44:28.290 align:middle line:10%
But that took me
30 years, right?

01:44:28.290 --> 01:44:31.400 align:middle line:90%


01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's
really confirming.

01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.010 align:middle line:90%
That's really confirming.

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
variant to that.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:46.050 align:middle line:84%
That is, all these ancient
civilizations said,

01:44:46.050 --> 01:44:48.600 align:middle line:84%
we didn't come up
with this stuff.

01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.900 align:middle line:84%
We got it from the sun gods
that came from the stars.

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.743 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:44:55.743 --> 01:44:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Don't see any
evidence in that.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the Hawaiians,
the Vedics, the Egyptians,

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:07.970 align:middle line:84%
the Mayans, the Incans, they
all talk about people that came

01:45:07.970 --> 01:45:12.590 align:middle line:84%
from the sky, from the stars,
and came and taught them all

01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:14.390 align:middle line:90%
this stuff.

01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it wasn't just
them tuning into the field

01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and getting it, but as well they
got it from external sources.

01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:38.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The field of creation is more
than just the field of creation

01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:39.560 align:middle line:90%
of this universe.

01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:42.510 align:middle line:90%


01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:46.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more than the field
of creation of this nature.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.330 align:middle line:84%
This nature or this
universe exists.

01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It's one of many
possible natures

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:56.720 align:middle line:90%
that might exist in creation.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:02.420 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, all
that we've been able to find,

01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:04.220 align:middle line:84%
all the descriptions
that you have given

01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:08.000 align:middle line:90%
to us in the last two hours--

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hour and a half.

01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hour and a half.

01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:12.990 align:middle line:90%
OK, 90 minutes.

01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It seemed like two hours to me.

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lot of information.

01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

01:46:18.970 --> 01:46:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It's compact.

01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:24.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But nonetheless, what I'm
trying to get at is that this

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:30.560 align:middle line:84%
nature is playing a role
in creation vis a vis other

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.940 align:middle line:90%
natures.

01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, it had to
produce the kind of entity

01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that you call the human that
goes through that system

01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and evolution, that has to
ask the question, who am I?

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:50.900 align:middle line:90%
And so that has a purpose.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

01:46:52.130 --> 01:46:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And we need to find and
understand that purpose

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.430 align:middle line:84%
in relation to the
bigger picture--

01:46:58.430 --> 01:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
the picture of the
whole of creation.

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:04.400 align:middle line:84%
What kind of role
this nature, that we

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.690 align:middle line:84%
are so fond of
finding out about it,

01:47:08.690 --> 01:47:12.500 align:middle line:84%
plays in the whole scheme
of things, whatever that is.

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we do.

01:47:16.460 --> 01:47:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
suggest that that's

01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:27.170 align:middle line:90%
both individual and global.

01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:30.770 align:middle line:90%
But that-- yeah.

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, this theory
I've been talking about

01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:37.640 align:middle line:84%
predicts that there
is an infinite amount

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:42.830 align:middle line:84%
of universe foaming out,
continuously universes

01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:44.420 align:middle line:90%
being created.

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they are created,
they're entangled.

01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:50.570 align:middle line:10%
Because they're still
in the field of creation

01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:51.770 align:middle line:10%
that you're talking about.

01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So they're still connected
through this field.

01:47:55.130 --> 01:47:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So they're still entangled
across all scales.

01:47:58.910 --> 01:48:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So all natures influence
all natures, every point.

01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Every point is influenced
by every other point.

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:13.290 align:middle line:90%


01:48:13.290 --> 01:48:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So it's a universal or
multiversal evolution

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't necessarily
know what is the--

01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:32.030 align:middle line:90%
have an endpoint in mind.

01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:34.708 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a concept of
man, that there's a start

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:35.750 align:middle line:90%
and there is a beginning.

01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:39.920 align:middle line:84%
From this, this took me
a while to integrate.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.501 align:middle line:90%
The rest was easy.

01:48:41.501 --> 01:48:44.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:46.210 align:middle line:90%
This was the hardest part.

01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:47.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:48:47.630 --> 01:48:50.720 align:middle line:84%
When I came to the
part of the equation

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:58.420 align:middle line:84%
where I couldn't
come up with anything

01:48:58.420 --> 01:49:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that would make me say,
this was a start here,

01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and then end is going
to be over here--

01:49:06.310 --> 01:49:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I could not find anything
anywhere, in all of the physics

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.430 align:middle line:84%
or all of the philosophy
of those physics, where

01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I can say for sure there's
going to be a start and an end.

01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And it just took me back so far.

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Like, I kept on traveling
through all the scales,

01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and I could not find
an end or a beginning.

01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
going to lose my mind.

01:49:36.130 --> 01:49:38.020 align:middle line:90%
Which had already happened.

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:41.320 align:middle line:84%
So I was all good, I
just didn't realize it.

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But I could not
continue doing physics.

01:49:48.490 --> 01:49:54.250 align:middle line:84%
It took me, I think, two and
a half weeks or three weeks

01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:56.230 align:middle line:90%
before I could get back to it.

01:49:56.230 --> 01:50:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I literally had to put
everything down and try

01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:02.470 align:middle line:90%
to integrate that--

01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:10.150 align:middle line:84%
try to integrate letting go
of a beginning or an end goal.

01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Like, letting go of--

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and I just-- it
took a long time.

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.160 align:middle line:84%
There was some kind
of fear attached

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.340 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of
letting go of that.

01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it felt like I
was if I was going to let

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:30.910 align:middle line:84%
go, that I was in freefall,
that I was going to disappear.

01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:33.095 align:middle line:90%
>> You'd discover the eternity--

01:50:33.095 --> 01:50:34.520 align:middle line:90%
no beginning, and no end.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.285 align:middle line:90%
>> No end, right.

01:50:37.285 --> 01:50:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And so I-- yeah.

01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But eternity doesn't mean
that there is no quantization,

01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that there's no process,
that there's no definition.

01:50:45.210 --> 01:50:48.520 align:middle line:84%
It just means that there's
continuous, infinite amount

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:49.420 align:middle line:90%
of definitions.

01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.155 align:middle line:84%
This is an error that as
well is done in physics,

01:50:52.155 --> 01:50:55.820 align:middle line:84%
is the idea that if you have
infinity you lose structure.

01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:57.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not necessarily true.

01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:59.850 align:middle line:84%
You can have an infinite
amount of structure.

01:50:59.850 --> 01:51:00.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:05.350 align:middle line:90%


01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:07.650 align:middle line:90%
So that I had to--

01:51:07.650 --> 01:51:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I spent two and
a half weeks climbing.

01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:14.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, I climbed
every morning,

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I climbed every night anyway.

01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:20.230 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, I would just sit
on the rocks in the mountains

01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:26.320 align:middle line:10%
and try to integrate letting
go of a beginning and an end,

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.700 align:middle line:10%
which was terrifying.

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:32.290 align:middle line:84%
But when I did, when I got
there, when I was OK to let

01:51:32.290 --> 01:51:39.580 align:middle line:84%
go, and I completely surrendered
to the continuum of creation,

01:51:39.580 --> 01:51:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually the
most beautiful thing--

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:48.790 align:middle line:84%
because it means that there
is continuous learning,

01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:54.070 align:middle line:84%
that it can never reach a point
where it stops learning, where

01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:58.630 align:middle line:84%
there is no more and learning
possibility, where all is known

01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:01.850 align:middle line:90%
and then the universe goes--

01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:04.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm out of luck.

01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It meant, as well, that
the idea that you're

01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
creating your reality
is only a variable

01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:15.580 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of the
information transfer,

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:21.910 align:middle line:84%
meaning that you are feeding
the whole information,

01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:24.070 align:middle line:84%
and the whole is
feeding you back

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:28.960 align:middle line:84%
your reality modified by
all the other variables,

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:35.470 align:middle line:84%
so that you will never, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:41.500 align:middle line:90%
get exactly what you intended.

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:42.500 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I mean it precisely, exactly.

01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:48.085 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
did, it would end.

01:52:48.085 --> 01:52:50.810 align:middle line:90%


01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And then the universe would end.

01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:57.680 align:middle line:84%
If any point, at any
place in all multiverses

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:04.220 align:middle line:84%
actually resolved all
nature in all universes,

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:06.570 align:middle line:90%
the universe would end.

01:53:06.570 --> 01:53:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's sad-- so that the
learning would always occur,

01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:26.230 align:middle line:84%
you would always be surprised by
what the universe is offering.

01:53:26.230 --> 01:53:27.610 align:middle line:90%
Right?

01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:31.570 align:middle line:90%
You would always have this.

01:53:31.570 --> 01:53:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And so this had some
fundamental nature in me,

01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:41.480 align:middle line:84%
as well, that anything
that's thrown at me--

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still not good at this,
not anywhere close to good

01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:49.870 align:middle line:90%
at it, but I know it--

01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that anything
that's thrown at me

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:58.180 align:middle line:84%
somewhere has its
learning purpose.

01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Like, I can learn from this.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.950 align:middle line:90%


01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if I actually
was able to create

01:54:06.850 --> 01:54:09.760 align:middle line:90%
exactly what I wanted--

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.220 align:middle line:90%
exactly, at any point--

01:54:12.220 --> 01:54:15.970 align:middle line:84%
then I would be bored
for the rest of eternity

01:54:15.970 --> 01:54:17.830 align:middle line:90%
from that point on.

01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:20.451 align:middle line:84%
If you can create
exactly what you want.

01:54:20.451 --> 01:54:27.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you imagine a nature
where everything is eternal.

01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:30.700 align:middle line:84%
A being in that nature
would know everything,

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:34.210 align:middle line:84%
because in eternity, you
get to know everything.

01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So it comes out that
then that is a static--

01:54:39.130 --> 01:54:41.170 align:middle line:90%
>> A static universe, yeah.

01:54:41.170 --> 01:54:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing ever happens,
nothing ever moves.

01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really boring.

01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Because-- but we don't
know what else could be done

01:54:50.646 --> 01:54:51.960 align:middle line:90%
in eternity.

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:52.890 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that--

01:54:52.890 --> 01:54:54.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

01:54:54.090 --> 01:54:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So it has that gradient.

01:54:55.610 --> 01:54:59.310 align:middle line:84%
It has that differential
to infinity.

01:54:59.310 --> 01:55:02.500 align:middle line:84%
But if that is
connected at all points,

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:07.890 align:middle line:84%
that means that, within
you, you have that capacity.

01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:09.060 align:middle line:90%
You have that knowledge.

01:55:09.060 --> 01:55:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Within you, within
each one of your atoms,

01:55:13.650 --> 01:55:18.510 align:middle line:84%
is all of the information
of every state of universes

01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:23.640 align:middle line:84%
across universes in
every Planck second.

01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't know what is going to
be in the next Planck second.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And this is why when people
talk about enlightenment,

01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.170 align:middle line:90%
I tell them, you know what?

01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Enlightenment is a process.

01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:39.800 align:middle line:90%
It's never a destination.

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in every moment,
you have the opportunity

01:55:45.770 --> 01:55:46.730 align:middle line:90%
to be enlightened.

01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:49.010 align:middle line:84%
That is, in every moment,
you have the opportunity

01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to be connected to the
whole and see it all.

01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:58.570 align:middle line:84%
The next moment, the guy on
the highway just cut you off,

01:55:58.570 --> 01:56:00.794 align:middle line:84%
and now you're giving
him the finger, right?

01:56:00.794 --> 01:56:04.510 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:08.840 align:middle line:90%
You know what happens?

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's hard.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.250 align:middle line:84%
To be enlightened in
every Planck second

01:56:14.250 --> 01:56:17.810 align:middle line:90%
is really, then, hard.

01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:19.710 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep at it.

01:56:19.710 --> 01:56:21.520 align:middle line:90%
You've got to keep--

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.320 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's a process.

01:56:24.570 --> 01:56:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe is
changing in every Planck second,

01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.010 align:middle line:90%
you've got to keep up.

01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:31.590 align:middle line:90%


01:56:31.590 --> 01:56:35.150 align:middle line:90%
You've got to stay with it.

01:56:35.150 --> 01:56:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

Oh, I got far away
from my title.

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.690 align:middle line:90%


01:56:52.690 --> 01:56:57.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, the antenna is an analogy.

01:56:57.530 --> 01:57:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But basically, think
of all these processes

01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:08.710 align:middle line:84%
through the Planck field, into
the atom, into the molecules,

01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:14.260 align:middle line:84%
into the biology, producing
this structure that you are.

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as like a conduit
that's oscillating a system.

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:21.290 align:middle line:90%
You clearly oscillating.

01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Like for instance,
you have a heartbeat.

01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:27.310 align:middle line:90%
You have lungs going like this.

01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the spinal
fluid going up and down

01:57:30.190 --> 01:57:36.490 align:middle line:84%
your spine that's making your
skull go wider and less wide--

01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:38.110 align:middle line:90%
that's pumping your skull.

01:57:38.110 --> 01:57:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And you've got all these.

01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, you've got all the blood
going through how many miles

01:57:44.650 --> 01:57:46.280 align:middle line:90%
of blood vessels?

01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:49.140 align:middle line:90%
And this is in kilometers?

01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:50.390 align:middle line:90%
No?

01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:51.432 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot.

01:57:51.432 --> 01:57:52.640 align:middle line:90%

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Right.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.580 align:middle line:84%
60,000-- that's way more than
what you drive in a year,

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.380 align:middle line:90%

01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:10.850 align:middle line:90%

01:58:21.890 --> 01:58:24.080 align:middle line:90%

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.960 align:middle line:84%
They've got to have a few
more miles than the average.

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, so imagine that
whole bio-oscillating field

01:58:58.440 --> 01:58:59.240 align:middle line:90%
that you are.

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.390 align:middle line:10%
It's complex.

01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:05.680 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it
as like an antenna

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in the structure of spacetime
picking up information.

01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:14.500 align:middle line:84%
Like your eyes,
for instance, has

01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:20.140 align:middle line:84%
like a black spot in the middle,
like a little black hole.

01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:21.520 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic fields,
photons, get sucked in there.

01:59:27.070 --> 01:59:29.240 align:middle line:90%
They go in.

01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then they fly in,
and then the information

01:59:34.570 --> 01:59:38.830 align:middle line:84%
is transferred into your
brain, and all this stuff.

01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:45.970 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's
not like an antenna--

01:59:45.970 --> 01:59:48.120 align:middle line:84%
now, when people
think of an antenna,

01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:52.380 align:middle line:84%
they typically only
think of a receiver.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:56.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about a transceiver.

01:59:56.010 --> 01:59:58.845 align:middle line:90%
So it transmits and receives.

01:59:58.845 --> 02:00:01.520 align:middle line:90%


02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:06.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just like you
are receiving information

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.940 align:middle line:90%
from the field.

02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You're transmitting information
from the field as well.

02:00:12.690 --> 02:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
So when you receive
the information,

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:19.490 align:middle line:84%
you interpret the information,
and then the field

02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:23.292 align:middle line:90%
reacts to your interpretation.

02:00:23.292 --> 02:00:32.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's feeding you creation
as you interpret the creation.

02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:35.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's coordinated creation.

02:00:35.090 --> 02:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
That is, the creation
it's feeding you,

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:43.190 align:middle line:84%
it's not like you can
say, s you know what?

02:00:43.190 --> 02:00:49.130 align:middle line:84%
This creation here is not
really what I want it to be.

02:00:49.130 --> 02:00:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to make
it a pink elephant.

02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to think that
this chair is a pink elephant.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And then, poof, it
becomes a pink elephant.

02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Because you fed that to
the field, and the field

02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:02.930 align:middle line:90%
is responding to you.

02:01:02.930 --> 02:01:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Uh-uh.

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not that easy.

02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was that
easy, as I was saying,

02:01:08.210 --> 02:01:09.710 align:middle line:90%
you'd get bored really quick.

02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
You'd make everything the
way you want it and be over.

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:18.860 align:middle line:10%
And the rest of the universe
would be a lot like-- you know.

02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:23.270 align:middle line:10%
But it's because I've got this
idea of what this chair is,

02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:25.700 align:middle line:10%
and she does, and he
does, and all this,

02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:29.765 align:middle line:10%
and we all participate
in what this chair is.

02:01:29.765 --> 02:01:32.330 align:middle line:90%


02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of solid it's
not going to budge much

02:01:36.850 --> 02:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
if you decide it's
a pink elephant.

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:42.140 align:middle line:90%


02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:46.340 align:middle line:84%
But if I got enough
of the field,

02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:51.450 align:middle line:84%
if I got enough of the
people in all of the world,

02:01:51.450 --> 02:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
in all of the universe
and everything,

02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:56.780 align:middle line:84%
to say this is a pink
elephant, to think

02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:02.690 align:middle line:84%
this is a pink elephant, it
might pop into a pink elephant.

02:02:02.690 --> 02:02:06.270 align:middle line:90%


02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:09.890 align:middle line:84%
But I would have to
convince a lot of people.

02:02:09.890 --> 02:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Because I've got to overcome all
the information that this chair

02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.275 align:middle line:90%
is-- and that's a lot--

02:02:16.275 --> 02:02:19.080 align:middle line:90%


02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
in all of the universes,
so that it can pop.

02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But I can change things that
are easier for me to change.

02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I can change the way I react
when something happens to me.

02:02:35.050 --> 02:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I can change the
way I interpret--

02:02:39.870 --> 02:02:42.030 align:middle line:90%
so when I'm getting--

02:02:42.030 --> 02:02:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm the antenna.

02:02:43.110 --> 02:02:45.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm the transceiver.

02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm getting
information, I can say,

02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, I'm not going
to react to this this way.

02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to react
to this this way.

02:02:56.890 --> 02:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
just your thoughts

02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:02.530 align:middle line:84%
that is the information
you're transmitting.

02:03:02.530 --> 02:03:07.780 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it is your emotions.

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm going to backtrack to
something I was saying earlier.

02:03:12.610 --> 02:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to
backtrack to the part

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:16.870 align:middle line:84%
where I said I'm
reversing biology.

02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you
that actually, it's

02:03:19.090 --> 02:03:24.190 align:middle line:84%
the field of information
that's driving the chemistry,

02:03:24.190 --> 02:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
not the chemistry just happening
to bump together and make

02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the right chemistry.

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens
in your chemistry?

02:03:32.650 --> 02:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
How do you change
your chemistry?

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So like, if you're
a transceiver, that

02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
means that somehow,
there is a dialing,

02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
there's a dial somewhere,
that you can tune the antenna,

02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:54.390 align:middle line:84%
so that it oscillates
at this frequency,

02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:56.310 align:middle line:84%
or it oscillates
at this frequency,

02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:58.080 align:middle line:90%
or at this frequency.

02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
You're tuning into different
radio stations, right?

02:04:04.020 --> 02:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
So there's radio stations where
you have really, you know,

02:04:11.580 --> 02:04:14.970 align:middle line:90%
not so harmonic music.

02:04:14.970 --> 02:04:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you have radio stations
where it's like, [VOCALIZING]

02:04:19.900 --> 02:04:23.710 align:middle line:90%
like angel kind of thing.

02:04:23.710 --> 02:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
That was not so good.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.830 align:middle line:90%
But you know, I do physics.

02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:31.900 align:middle line:84%
I need somebody
else for that part.

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:39.400 align:middle line:84%
But this-- so how do
you tune that puppy?

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:44.280 align:middle line:10%
Well, you find that
your biorhythms--

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.960 align:middle line:10%
like your breathing, your
heart, your spinal cord fluid--

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:53.760 align:middle line:10%
all that changes with what?

02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Emotions.

02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:56.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Your state of emotions.

02:04:56.420 --> 02:04:58.790 align:middle line:10%
That's right.

02:04:58.790 --> 02:05:00.990 align:middle line:90%
So that's the dial.

02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:02.180 align:middle line:90%
Right?

02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:06.920 align:middle line:10%
How you interpret things,
and your state of emotion,

02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:14.120 align:middle line:10%
is going to define what
your antenna is tuning to.

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
It's going to tune in to this
radio station or this radio

02:05:18.500 --> 02:05:20.780 align:middle line:90%
station.

02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the dial,
when it's tuned

02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:27.320 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way through
your state of emotions--

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
because we know
that's what's driving.

02:05:31.710 --> 02:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
When you change your emotion,
we see the chemistry changing.

02:05:35.670 --> 02:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, the chemistry
is not changing because--

02:05:39.500 --> 02:05:45.570 align:middle line:84%
and this is a big problem in
psychiatry, where they think,

02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
oh, we'll change the
chemistry, and we'll be good.

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:51.540 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work.

02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Why doesn't it work?

02:05:52.890 --> 02:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you're changing
the result, not the cause.

02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:02.275 align:middle line:84%
So you take the chemistry
away, and you've

02:06:02.275 --> 02:06:03.150 align:middle line:90%
got the same problem.

02:06:03.150 --> 02:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%


02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you change
the chemistry, when

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
you change the state of emotion,
you know the chemistry changed.

02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
result. So how do you

02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:20.780 align:middle line:90%
change that state of emotion?

02:06:20.780 --> 02:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
You change the state of emotion
by interpreting the world

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.502 align:middle line:90%
differently.

02:06:25.502 --> 02:06:28.770 align:middle line:90%


02:06:28.770 --> 02:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you are in
situations where you can say,

02:06:34.210 --> 02:06:38.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, now I'm going to
fly off the handle.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I do that all the time.

02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:42.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not pretty.

02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Ask my staff.

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:47.030 align:middle line:90%
It makes a big mess--

02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:48.450 align:middle line:90%
and sometimes necessary.

02:06:48.450 --> 02:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%


02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Or you can make the--

02:06:55.500 --> 02:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
you can interpret the
field a little different,

02:06:58.030 --> 02:07:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and then say, OK, I'm going
to approach this differently.

02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have the state
of emotion go this way.

02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:07.680 align:middle line:90%
10 minutes left?

02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:08.690 align:middle line:90%
Really?

02:07:08.690 --> 02:07:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.525 align:middle line:84%
What happened to the
last hour and 10 minutes?

02:07:12.525 --> 02:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%


02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, this is why my
talks were 13 hours a while ago.

02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But we were going to do some
experiment with the crystals.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:31.590 align:middle line:90%
You guys still want to do that?

02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:33.330 align:middle line:90%
We have 10 minutes.

02:07:33.330 --> 02:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
take one of those.

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:37.320 align:middle line:90%
How many people are in here?

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:40.710 align:middle line:90%
We probably have-- uh-oh.

02:07:40.710 --> 02:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting the
look from Andrea.

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.810 align:middle line:90%
I know that look.

02:07:45.810 --> 02:07:49.380 align:middle line:90%
What are you making me do?

02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We can go a little
long, can't we?

02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:52.470 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:07:53.740 --> 02:07:54.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

02:07:54.540 --> 02:08:00.552 align:middle line:84%
So basically, all this
is to tell you that--

02:08:00.552 --> 02:08:03.264 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:08:03.264 --> 02:08:06.560 align:middle line:84%
--that you can tap into
a field of information.

02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Johanna?

02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to add something, too.

02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:09.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:10.630 align:middle line:90%
The mic?

02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:13.850 align:middle line:90%


02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.250 align:middle line:90%
Here you go, Johanna.

02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:22.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So like Nassim said, it's
all kind of a nested thing.

02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:26.120 align:middle line:10%
The universe and the
teeny, teeny little things

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.330 align:middle line:10%
are kind of nested
into each other and--

02:08:29.330 --> 02:08:30.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Like Russian dolls.

02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:32.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, like Russian dolls.

02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.505 align:middle line:10%
And without body,
it's kind of the same.

02:08:35.505 --> 02:08:39.230 align:middle line:10%
The major magnetic
spinning field we have

02:08:39.230 --> 02:08:41.580 align:middle line:10%
is the field of our heart.

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's a kind of
circulating current

02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
inducing a magnetic
field, which is

02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:49.230 align:middle line:90%
kind of called the aura maybe.

02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
the cells which

02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:53.340 align:middle line:90%
have their own magnetic field.

02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.031 align:middle line:90%
And then the little plug thing.

02:08:56.031 --> 02:08:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And you have the brain, which
has its own magnetic field.

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of a subfield
in the whole field.

02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And if you grow a
child, you grow it

02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:09.766 align:middle line:84%
inside of your own
magnetic field,

02:09:09.766 --> 02:09:12.665 align:middle line:84%
but it will become a
separate field of its own.

02:09:12.665 --> 02:09:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And it comes out of a
black hole, by the way.

02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's
getting stabilized

02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:25.180 align:middle line:84%
in its morphogenetic development
by developing the heartbeat.

02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So for me, the
heartbeat is the key.

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.980 align:middle line:90%
And the emotions tied to it.

02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in
a stressful moment,

02:09:34.090 --> 02:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
then you can't bring the
heart into a coherent state.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And you need the heart in
a coherent beating state

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to kind of influence
your brain to go itself

02:09:50.090 --> 02:09:54.350 align:middle line:84%
into a coherent state and then
kind of let go of everything.

02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what meditation is
about, to not influence it

02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:02.800 align:middle line:84%
by all these questions we have,
but let the universe speak

02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:05.500 align:middle line:84%
to all of what we
call "unconscious,"

02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:08.350 align:middle line:84%
but what may be
the conscious part.

02:10:08.350 --> 02:10:10.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's running all of it.

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
shown that intuition

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:15.640 align:middle line:84%
works through the heart, and
the heart perceives the future.

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's the key if the
heart is able to translate it

02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:25.064 align:middle line:90%
to the translator, the brain.

02:10:25.064 --> 02:10:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So that would be my take
on what's the antenna.

02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:29.980 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is from
a heart surgeon.

02:10:29.980 --> 02:10:31.520 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:32.320 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.930 align:middle line:90%


02:10:34.930 --> 02:10:45.270 align:middle line:10%
So I was hoping we would
have more time for this,

02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:49.050 align:middle line:10%
but I went a little long.

02:10:49.050 --> 02:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%
So I wanted to have you guys--

02:10:52.290 --> 02:10:54.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we're
going to pull this off.

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you guys will have to
do an experimental thing.

02:10:58.620 --> 02:11:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, we could try.

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:02.060 align:middle line:10%
We can try?

02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:03.506 align:middle line:90%
You're keen for it?

02:11:03.506 --> 02:11:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:07.580 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take one
of those apart.

02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:09.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, go for it.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.810 align:middle line:90%
She's the fastest ever.

02:11:10.810 --> 02:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
These were--

02:11:11.610 --> 02:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE] make
them in groups of eight.

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I was going to give one
to each other, to everybody.

02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So we'll start
distributing them.

02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:24.370 align:middle line:90%
So we have 64 of those.

02:11:24.370 --> 02:11:27.890 align:middle line:10%
I think we probably
have the same amount--

02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:28.690 align:middle line:10%
yeah.

02:11:28.690 --> 02:11:30.850 align:middle line:90%
You want to distribute them?

02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:33.810 align:middle line:90%
They all have to come back.

02:11:33.810 --> 02:11:35.140 align:middle line:90%
OK?

02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:40.630 align:middle line:84%
These were in Egypt in
the pyramids of Egypt.

02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:43.480 align:middle line:90%
And they are very sacred to me.

02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:47.850 align:middle line:90%


02:11:47.850 --> 02:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Horribly, during this
expo we had a group

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.000 align:middle line:90%
of crystals that disappeared.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:59.040 align:middle line:90%
It's terrible.

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess somebody
needed them more than I did.

02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:08.520 align:middle line:90%


02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:11.710 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad they have them.

02:12:11.710 --> 02:12:13.542 align:middle line:90%
I wish they would have asked me.

02:12:13.542 --> 02:12:16.500 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:17.910 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Tiding yeah.

02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:23.000 align:middle line:90%


02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.160 align:middle line:90%
We need more?

02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:28.005 align:middle line:10%
>> No, they're planning
[INAUDIBLE] meditation,

02:12:28.005 --> 02:12:30.315 align:middle line:10%
and then I can come up
and put it together with

02:12:30.315 --> 02:12:31.970 align:middle line:10%
your intention.

02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:33.283 align:middle line:10%
>> Put them together?

02:12:33.283 --> 02:12:34.702 align:middle line:10%
>> And then when
we do meditation,

02:12:34.702 --> 02:12:35.890 align:middle line:10%
they're all using it.

02:12:35.890 --> 02:12:39.100 align:middle line:10%
And then they can come up in
groups of four to make a four.

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:41.850 align:middle line:10%
And then the next four
can go, and make an eight.

02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

02:12:42.650 --> 02:12:46.070 align:middle line:90%
And put them back together?

02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:49.280 align:middle line:10%
So if you look on the
little crystal, everybody,

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:55.250 align:middle line:10%
you will see there's a little
arrow on one of the apex.

02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:57.380 align:middle line:90%
The little arrow goes on top.

02:12:57.380 --> 02:13:00.500 align:middle line:90%


02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to put it
in your left hand, OK?

02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:08.750 align:middle line:90%


02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to put
it in your left hand.

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you
to take your finger,

02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
your index finger
on the other hand,

02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and move it around in your
left hand, just a little bit.

02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Try to put it in the middle,
in the middle of your hand,

02:13:25.730 --> 02:13:28.610 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of your palm,
closest to the middle.

02:13:28.610 --> 02:13:32.270 align:middle line:90%
And then move it around until--

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:34.280 align:middle line:90%
be aware of what it's doing--

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:41.860 align:middle line:84%
until you feel it start buzzing,
like where it buzzes the most.

02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Can you guys feel that?

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.180 align:middle line:90%


02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
At one point, it starts going
[HUMS] [BEEP] You feel that?

02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:54.310 align:middle line:90%
You guys get it?

02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:55.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

02:13:55.184 --> 02:13:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Mine is defective.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:58.870 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

02:13:58.870 --> 02:14:02.730 align:middle line:90%


02:14:02.730 --> 02:14:05.440 align:middle line:90%
Here, let me put it--

02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.300 align:middle line:90%
there we go.

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

02:14:08.100 --> 02:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to hear it,
but you're going to feel it.

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.560 align:middle line:90%
OK?

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Don't put your finger on top.

02:14:15.690 --> 02:14:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you
to put your hand

02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
on the crystal of your neighbor,
your other hand that's free.

02:14:25.210 --> 02:14:26.010 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

02:14:26.010 --> 02:14:29.408 align:middle line:10%
And link your row.

02:14:29.408 --> 02:14:33.764 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

02:14:33.764 --> 02:14:36.670 align:middle line:90%


02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Go to the end of the row.

02:14:40.670 --> 02:14:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Does that work?

02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:43.154 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

02:14:43.154 --> 02:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Nassim, are we
touching or nothing?

02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not touching.

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit above.

02:14:48.860 --> 02:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
Just a little bit above.

02:14:50.150 --> 02:14:53.150 align:middle line:90%


02:14:53.150 --> 02:14:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Do you guys feel that?

02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
If you put your hand over
the ones of your neighbor,

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
just a little bit
above, eventually you

02:15:03.820 --> 02:15:07.885 align:middle line:84%
should start to
feel a little dot

02:15:07.885 --> 02:15:12.860 align:middle line:84%
in your hand that doesn't have
a crystal going into your hand.

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
You feel that?

02:15:14.610 --> 02:15:18.230 align:middle line:90%
See how it's getting stronger?

02:15:18.230 --> 02:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
That is your energy
center starting

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to feel the flow of the vacuum
in that region of space.

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
You're actually
feeling the structure

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.470 align:middle line:84%
of space, the
information of space,

02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:35.110 align:middle line:90%
flowing through your body.

02:15:35.110 --> 02:15:36.426 align:middle line:90%
You guys feel that?

02:15:36.426 --> 02:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's strong.

02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:40.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's strong, huh?

02:15:40.150 --> 02:15:42.380 align:middle line:84%
If it's weak, it's
going to get stronger.

02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:43.510 align:middle line:90%
It takes a little time.

02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:47.090 align:middle line:90%


02:15:47.090 --> 02:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And then after you've done
that, then do it to yourself.

02:15:51.380 --> 02:15:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Bring your hand back over
yourself without touching it.

02:15:58.550 --> 02:16:01.710 align:middle line:90%


02:16:01.710 --> 02:16:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You can move your
hand a little bit so

02:16:03.690 --> 02:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that you find a spot on the
top hand where it buzzes,

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.186 align:middle line:90%
where it--

02:16:10.186 --> 02:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It actually hurts.

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:16:13.190 --> 02:16:14.950 align:middle line:90%
It can hurt a little bit.

02:16:14.950 --> 02:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

02:16:15.870 --> 02:16:16.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

02:16:16.710 --> 02:16:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so
much information flow.

02:16:20.770 --> 02:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And what you're actually
feeling is the change

02:16:23.110 --> 02:16:25.540 align:middle line:84%
in the molecule the
structure of the water

02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
in your body as the
information flows through it.

02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
These little crystals are
little amplifiers of information

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.840 align:middle line:90%
in that region of space.

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
They make a little vortex
of the Planck field.

02:16:39.170 --> 02:16:41.799 align:middle line:84%
It's called a
gravitational vortex,

02:16:41.799 --> 02:16:45.049 align:middle line:90%
or a gravitational laser.

02:16:45.049 --> 02:16:46.530 align:middle line:90%
You feel it?

02:16:46.530 --> 02:16:47.780 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And you can-- when the flow
is going on into your hand,

02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:59.209 align:middle line:84%
you can direct that flow through
your arm, and up your arm,

02:16:59.209 --> 02:17:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and then across and back
into your other hand,

02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:03.230 align:middle line:90%
and back across.

02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:05.510 align:middle line:90%
You can close the loop.

02:17:05.510 --> 02:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And then it will start
to amplify even more.

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:11.969 align:middle line:84%
And as it goes
across your chest,

02:17:11.969 --> 02:17:16.129 align:middle line:84%
you can direct it down to your
heart, and into your liver,

02:17:16.129 --> 02:17:21.170 align:middle line:84%
and then to your organs, and
down into your pubic bones,

02:17:21.170 --> 02:17:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and down into your
leg, into your toes.

02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:36.730 align:middle line:90%


02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And you might find that
there's regions in your body

02:17:39.730 --> 02:17:41.620 align:middle line:84%
where it doesn't
circulate so well.

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:44.379 align:middle line:84%
You feel it circulating
everywhere else,

02:17:44.379 --> 02:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
but there's places where
you can't feel it circulate.

02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:51.170 align:middle line:90%


02:17:51.170 --> 02:17:52.650 align:middle line:90%
You can direct it there.

02:17:52.650 --> 02:17:53.969 align:middle line:90%
You can think about--

02:17:53.969 --> 02:17:56.450 align:middle line:84%
remember, this is
information in the field.

02:17:56.450 --> 02:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
So since your consciousness
is information in the field,

02:17:59.510 --> 02:18:01.939 align:middle line:84%
you can direct where
the information goes.

02:18:01.939 --> 02:18:05.690 align:middle line:90%


02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:08.260 align:middle line:90%
You guys feel that?

02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel your chakra lining
up, like your crown chakra,

02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:15.469 align:middle line:84%
and everything's
starting to open up?

02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:19.760 align:middle line:90%


02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:25.129 align:middle line:84%
And so this is little technology
I invented like in 1999.

02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:27.559 align:middle line:84%
I'm starting to finally
put it on the market.

02:18:27.559 --> 02:18:29.670 align:middle line:90%
But this is the baby step.

02:18:29.670 --> 02:18:31.250 align:middle line:84%
This is a technology
that will run

02:18:31.250 --> 02:18:34.010 align:middle line:84%
the spaceship, and your
house, and your car very soon.

02:18:34.010 --> 02:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
But this is just like
an experiential thing

02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:41.669 align:middle line:90%
you're actually feeling.

02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:42.469 align:middle line:90%
Right?

02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:44.629 align:middle line:90%
You guys see what I mean?

02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can actually-- and
it's powerful, because it can--

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.059 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the plants that are
exposed to this little crystal

02:18:53.059 --> 02:19:00.156 align:middle line:84%
grow 400, 450% faster than
the plants that are not.

02:19:00.156 --> 02:19:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have to be
close to it, or in it?

02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You can just get the
water to pass over it,

02:19:07.340 --> 02:19:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and then use the water
to water your plants.

02:19:09.770 --> 02:19:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because it's changing
the water structure.

02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:14.120 align:middle line:10%
It's structuring the
water in your body.

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:15.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The water speed.

02:19:15.710 --> 02:19:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sorry?

02:19:16.510 --> 02:19:18.370 align:middle line:90%
>> The speed.

02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It can go fast, slow--

02:19:21.330 --> 02:19:22.219 align:middle line:90%
>> The spin?

02:19:22.219 --> 02:19:23.019 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

02:19:23.019 --> 02:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
How is the speed that
goes the water on top?

02:19:25.650 --> 02:19:27.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It can go very fast.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.209 align:middle line:90%
And it will structure.

02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that what Dr. Emoto
said you do, just by praying?

02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

02:19:34.170 --> 02:19:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Except that this is
amplifying your prayer,

02:19:38.250 --> 02:19:44.889 align:middle line:84%
so that the plants are growing
way faster than if you just

02:19:44.889 --> 02:19:46.460 align:middle line:90%
prayed over your water.

02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.260 align:middle line:90%
OK?

02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Regular crystals
you have to recharge.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Do you have to recharge these?

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:54.110 align:middle line:10%
Those will stay
charged for eternity--

02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:55.820 align:middle line:10%
I mean, for eternity--

02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.560 align:middle line:10%
for a very long time.

02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Because spacetime
is a superfluid.

02:20:02.470 --> 02:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And the way I
create this crystal,

02:20:06.930 --> 02:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
it's producing this
superfluid dynamics.

02:20:10.610 --> 02:20:13.970 align:middle line:10%
But if you boil it,
then you will lose it,

02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:16.320 align:middle line:10%

02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:38.670 align:middle line:90%
All right.

02:30:38.670 --> 02:30:40.950 align:middle line:90%
So we have to liberate the room.

02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to try to do
that in the most graceful way.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.658 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to pass by
and pick up the crystals from

02:30:46.658 --> 02:30:47.458 align:middle line:90%
everyone's hands.

02:30:47.458 --> 02:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Can everyone hold their
crystal so then we know who has

02:30:48.940 --> 02:30:50.070 align:middle line:90%
crystals, who has crystals?

02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.870 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:52.940 align:middle line:10%
So we'll start picking
up the crystals.

02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:54.910 align:middle line:10%
Thank you very much.

02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:56.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Cheers.

02:30:56.610 --> 02:31:00.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

02:31:00.110 --> 02:31:01.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

02:31:01.940 --> 02:31:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much,
everybody, for your time,

02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and your energy, and
your participation.

02:31:08.670 --> 02:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You are an antenna participating
in a field of energy,

02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:14.330 align:middle line:90%
transmitting and receiving.

02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, until
we see each other again,

02:31:20.240 --> 02:31:22.701 align:middle line:90%
may the vacuum be with you.

02:31:22.701 --> 02:31:26.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, everybody.

02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:29.340 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:32.840 align:middle line:90%
