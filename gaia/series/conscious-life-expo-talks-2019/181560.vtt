[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't know if
you heard me on the panel.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't like talking
about my personal life.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.790 align:middle line:84%
That's one thing, because
I just love doing the work.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, the work
is so darned exciting.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody says, well,
how do you describe yourself?

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:90%
And I describe myself as Linda--

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
uh, it's kind of--

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.320 align:middle line:90%
well, wait, as-- wait a minute.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I describe myself as
Barbara Walters of ufology

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
or Lois Lane looking
for Superman.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Those are two women journalists.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And so I really--

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:90%
you know, that's what I do.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a ufologist.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm an investigative
journalist, which

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
means I don't care what
the story is, whether--

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's really great
in the United States.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Any story that comes
out, the mummies,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
anything that comes out--
oh, hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.480 align:middle line:84%
How can I not do the story
just because somebody

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:90%
decided it was a hoax?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I do the story.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And usually a lot
of my interviews,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.450 align:middle line:84%
I have to go there two and
three times, because I'm not

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:90%
convinced.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And how do I do this?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Why don't other people
in the field do it?

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any idea
how much money it costs?

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back to
New Mexico in April

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.600 align:middle line:90%
to do the crash again, 1945.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:84%
It costs $500 every time I
go down there to do this--

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:84%
seven years I've been
working on this story.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And the money doesn't
come from anywhere.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, the
average person who's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.490 align:middle line:84%
married, the husband's going
to go, are you kidding?

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.900 align:middle line:90%
$500 on this?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:90%
Are you out of your mind?

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.492 align:middle line:84%
My children always
say, why don't you

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
do Sandals, and go
down to the Caribbean,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:90%
and sit on the beach?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
You're in your 70s.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're
out of your mind.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
But thank god they love
me unconditionally.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And yesterday they both
texted me, thank god,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and they said, mom, you
know, we're really happy.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I have a 52-year-old daughter
and a 47-year-old son.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So they both-- Todd and Lisa
both texted me and said,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:84%
mom, congratulations,
cool, and so forth.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It helps.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
However, when I do a story,
I cannot go home and share it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.120 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
They always say,
don't don't tell us,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
stay in our world.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
It is scary.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
What does it have
to do with our life?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
By the way, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:84%
it has everything to
do with your life.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.930 align:middle line:84%
It is the most important
question on this planet.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
It is the most important
study that we could do.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
The reason why people
don't embrace it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.560 align:middle line:84%
or we have these skeptics
is because when you find out

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
and when you really
digest the truth,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
it will take you, throw
you against a wall,

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
turn you upside
down, and you change.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.535 align:middle line:90%
And people don't want to change.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
They like to stay
in their world.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They like to stay
in their world.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.405 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame them, though.

00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame them.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Both Grant Cameron and I have
suffered incredible change

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.340 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We were both very
nuts and bolts.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Grant Cameron was
a presidential UFO.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I was the nuts and
bolts with Allen Hynek,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:90%
putting pins in maps.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.150 align:middle line:90%
I was fine.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, don't tell me
any of the scary stuff.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to know.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.370 align:middle line:90%
It's not that it's negative.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
It's that it's not
in our reality.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.480 align:middle line:84%
I have to stretch
my brain around it.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:90%
I have to think outside the box.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It is not in a reality
that I was brought up in.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And for me to stretch
my brain around it

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
or wrap my brain around it, it
involves my changing my world

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:90%
view.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So I admire every
researcher in the world

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%
that has changed their mind.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
One of them was John Mack.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.780 align:middle line:84%
I spent hours in my
apartment speaking to him.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
He started out one way,
and he sat with me,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
and he said, Paola,
he said, this

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
is all about
consciousness, people

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:90%
are being directly downloaded.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.850 align:middle line:90%
He was off the abduction stuff.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and we
need to change our world

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
view on this planet to
accommodate this reality.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, we also
need to change our science.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So you know, when you're
talking to John Mack, professor

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
at Harvard University,
he's a psychiatrist.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
He's not just anybody
off the street.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm talking
to Jacques VallÃ©e.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is
dedicated to Jacques,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:90%
because Jacques is 79 years old.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
These guys have been
working at this forever.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So I only want to
tell you one thing.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
This presentation is
hard on me, because it

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:90%
includes my personal life.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried very hard to
stay away from my personal life

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and just present the
word-for-word interviews

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
of the witnesses,
military and intelligence

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:90%
people, and astronauts.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very close to Dr.
Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to his
funeral by his family.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Uri Geller this morning
congratulated me on my award.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:90%
I was really shocked.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I know all these people,
but I didn't do it on purpose.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to look
like flag-waving,

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.950 align:middle line:84%
but somebody shoved
me on this road

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
and put me at the right
place at the right time.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And I just know them all.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.352 align:middle line:84%
I know them all, and they've
all helped me in my growth.

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So this is going
to be hard for me,

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to go
through it really fast

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and tell you that of
all the synchronicities

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and the weirdness,
the weirdness that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:90%
has happened since I started.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:10%
So I realized over
these 40 years

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:10%
that my work was guided, that
somebody wanted me to do this.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.560 align:middle line:10%
But I didn't have any idea.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.200 align:middle line:10%
So my logic-- and there
I am like, you know,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:10%
Lois Lane or Barbara
Walters, because I

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.620 align:middle line:10%
wanted to be like that.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I want to be like I'm on a
news show and I'm interviewing.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:90%
That's what I wanted.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be credible.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:10%
There's Jacques VallÃ©e.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:10%
My thanks to Jacques VallÃ©e
after reading the books.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.190 align:middle line:10%
And if you still read "Forbidden
Science," volumes 2 and 3

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.058 align:middle line:10%
changed my life.

00:06:08.058 --> 00:06:09.350 align:middle line:10%
They put all the dots together.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.050 align:middle line:10%
I found out what was happening.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:10%
Because he's navigated
in all the worlds.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:10%
He's navigated in the
intelligence community,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:10%
in the paranormal, in the UFOs.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.080 align:middle line:10%
And then he was Allen
Hynek's right-hand man.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:10%
He even told me that he
organized the files for Allen

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:10%
in the 1960s in his house
in Evanston, Illinois.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:10%
So he knows what's going on.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.167 align:middle line:84%
So here's Allen and Jacques
when they were very young.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:90%
When they were very young.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Allen, when I met him.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
That's my picture
of him, was 72.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
was that, because I

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
wanted it to be nuts--

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.420 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be craft
coming from another planet,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and they were just
visiting, and so forth.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:90%
It's more than that.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.250 align:middle line:90%
It's super weird.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.200 align:middle line:84%
It's weirdness like
you can't even imagine.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's a name that the
intelligence community uses.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.245 align:middle line:84%
Its "phenomenology,"
because it has

00:07:04.245 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to do with phenomena
of all kinds.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I remember Allen
Hynek saying to me, Paola,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to
touch the paranormal,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
but don't throw the baby
out with the bathwater.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.480 align:middle line:10%
So "UFOs are physical
manifestations that cannot be

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:10%
understood apart from their
psychic--" look at that word--

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:10%
"and symbolic reality.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.560 align:middle line:10%
What we see here is
not an alien invasion.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:10%
It is a spiritual system
that acts on humans

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.220 align:middle line:10%
and uses humans."

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, if there is an overall
current of consciousness,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.790 align:middle line:10%
you can't go bad and good.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:10%
It's wake up.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:10%
It's a wake-up.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:10%
It's a consciousness.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm touching your life
so something happens.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.320 align:middle line:10%
Here are the people
in my life now

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:10%
that have gone in
that direction.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:10%
And I am trying.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.280 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you know that
I run the Laughlin Conference

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.260 align:middle line:10%
that's called Starworks USA.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:10%
It's the seventh year.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:10%
That's why you
have the postcard.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:10%
I do kind of a great
intellectual kind of conference

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:10%
where we have a lot of fun.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:10%
But I bring in speakers to
talk about consciousness space

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:10%
research.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:10%
I do not come and
invite speakers

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:10%
to scare the living daylights
out of 3/4 of the audience.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't bring
any consciousness.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:10%
That just puts you
back in your box.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:10%
And also, the other
thing about that

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:10%
is that I have access
to international people.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:10%
And people who heard
me on the panel

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:10%
will know that
Ricardo Gonzalez, who

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:10%
is the contactee that invited
me to Shasta to see the ET.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:10%
I've had him three
times at my conference.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.250 align:middle line:10%
And if I didn't know
international people,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:52.215 align:middle line:10%
people only in America are the
ones talking to the Americans,

00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:10%
you're not getting
all the information.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.300 align:middle line:10%
Every time Ricardo
speaks, I have

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:10%
to go tell people
to come back in.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.270 align:middle line:10%
300 people walk out with him
after he's done his lecture.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:10%
He's so grounded.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.200 align:middle line:10%
He talks about his
contact in Latin America.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.540 align:middle line:10%
He talks about what
the message is.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.920 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a Nordic.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:10%
These people come from Apu.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.510 align:middle line:10%
They have a base in
Huascaran in the Andes.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And they are future people.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.770 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they
are time travelers.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.990 align:middle line:84%
There is no time, so
they can see the future.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And they've told
him several things.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And he could only
speak in Laughlin,

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
because I know these
international people.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
This year I'm bringing
Maurizio Baiata from Italy

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to speak about the Michael
Wolf Kruvante case.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.020 align:middle line:90%
He was my editor in Rome.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.300 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is that
the internationalness

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Laughlin
Starworks Conference

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.840 align:middle line:84%
is very important for
people who want information.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It only happens because
I know these people.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
So my colleagues that have
graduated into grad school

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.480 align:middle line:84%
are Colin Andrews
and Grant Cameron.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And Grant Cameron, my god,
I sat through his-- and I do

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:90%
sit through people's lectures.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.120 align:middle line:84%
He went yesterday and went as
far as saying consciousness

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.920 align:middle line:90%
is not in the brain.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's in the field.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So people who are
talking about your brain

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
acts like this, your
brain acts like that,

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.810 align:middle line:84%
well, then go and
explain a psychic.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Go explain weirdness.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Go explain different dimensions.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the brain.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:90%
It's a field.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:90%
It is in the cog--

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
in the ether.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.300 align:middle line:84%
And Grant has done
that, and he can

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
explain it much better
than I will ever do,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
he graduated to.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And so did Colin Andrews.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:10%
The book, if you still read,
"The Edge Of Reality" talks

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:10%
about--

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's so interesting,
because I read a lot.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:10%
I have all my
colleagues' books, and I

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:10%
don't think my colleagues have
ever read one of my five books.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:10%
I read them all.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.883 align:middle line:10%
I have to.

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
If I want to know,
I mean, can you

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.230 align:middle line:84%
imagine getting a
degree in anthropology

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:90%
by reading your own book?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.490 align:middle line:90%
So they give you a degree.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.830 align:middle line:90%
You don't read anything else.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't know anything else.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:84%
In order to study ufology,
you have to do all of it.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to read-- you
may not agree with it,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
but at least you
have a common base.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And since I have a
master's in education

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.385 align:middle line:84%
and I taught English, when
I used to assign Steinbeck,

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
"Of Mice And Men,"
and the kids came in

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't read it,
I couldn't do anything.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
want to do today?

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Nobody read the book.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Do you understand how logical it
is that everybody in the field

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:84%
should be reading everything
to put the pieces of the puzzle

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:90%
together?

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason I think like
that is because I'm a teacher.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know that unless I read
what other people have done,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:90%
I don't do crop circles.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't do ancient astronauts.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So unless I read all of
that and see what they--

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.540 align:middle line:90%
I can't put the pieces together.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And if my motivation
is I just want to know,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:90%
I've got to do it.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
"The Edge Of Reality."

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.010 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Collin and
I said, how did you

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.360 align:middle line:90%
graduate to consciousness?

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And what he said to me
was, Paola, he said,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
even the ones that are making
the crop circles, he said,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.487 align:middle line:84%
they're getting the
idea from somewhere.

00:12:08.487 --> 00:12:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, some of them
begin and the next morning it's

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.363 align:middle line:90%
done by itself.

00:12:13.363 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:90%
They didn't finish it.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else-- something
else finished it.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So he's telling me all
of these things which

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.570 align:middle line:90%
are making me think.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:10%
And there's Jacques down at
the bottom, who already knew.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:10%
Leonardo da Vinci--
"learn how to see,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:10%
realize that everything is
connected to everything else."

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:10%
So this is just things
that have happened,

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.257 align:middle line:10%
because these are
personal things.

00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:10%
So this is Christmas.

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:10%
Every Christmas I
have this theme.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.420 align:middle line:10%
I have a theme.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:10%
So I bought all kinds
of tissues, and napkins,

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:10%
and everything with the famous
truck with the Christmas tree

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:10%
behind it and everything.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:10%
That was my theme this year.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:90%
And what do I get?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
A card from Jacques VallÃ©e with
a truck with a Christmas tree.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And you know, any more, the
more you notice weirdness,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:90%
the more it happens.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I
can't believe this.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.580 align:middle line:90%
All my dishes, my pa--

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
how can-- like, how can I
get a Christmas tree truck,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, from him
when-- and then I

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:84%
thought, the reason why
you got the Christmas tree

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and the truck is
because, Paola, you've

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:84%
got to talk about it,
which is something

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Then the next thing happened.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:10%
So that little bear
that comes from Harrods

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:10%
that was given to me by
Uri Geller-- but I'll

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:10%
tell you the story
behind that in a minute.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:10%
So this year the theme--

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.550 align:middle line:10%
and the color is
black and white.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.630 align:middle line:84%
We have, what do you call it, a
cocktail party and everything.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:40.867 align:middle line:90%
Everybody dresses in color.

00:13:40.867 --> 00:13:42.450 align:middle line:84%
I tell you what the
color is, and it's

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.617 align:middle line:90%
one mass of black and white.

00:13:43.617 --> 00:13:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Last year it was
one mass of green.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to Angela
Townsend Smith,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very close
to Russell Targ.

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.920 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking to Angela
about two hours on the phone,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:10%
and we're talking about her--

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:10%
you know, she was a remote
viewer for the government.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:10%
She's very good.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:10%
And she does classes in Morovia.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.525 align:middle line:10%
And we get on the
subject of Uri Geller.

00:14:05.525 --> 00:14:06.325 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking.

00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:09.075 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying, my life with
Uri was really weird.

00:14:09.075 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:10%
I connected with
him when I started

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.070 align:middle line:10%
studying the Council of
Nine, people who have read

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:10%
"The Only Planet of Choice."

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if it's
familiar to you.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.570 align:middle line:10%
I met Philip Schlemmer.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:10%
I'll tell you all about that.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.420 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And then I said goodbye.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.090 align:middle line:10%
And I go to take my car keys,
and I put them in the car,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.780 align:middle line:10%
and they don't fit the
ignition, because my car

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:10%
keys have been bent and--

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.350 align:middle line:10%
from a long distance.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.860 align:middle line:10%
And Uri has done this
over and over again.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.470 align:middle line:10%
If you talk about him, my friend
who's a movie star in Italy,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.300 align:middle line:10%
is sitting in the audience
when Uri is talking,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:10%
and his key is bent so
badly he can't get back

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.740 align:middle line:10%
into his hotel room.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:10%
Without touching it,
without, you know--

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:10%
there is no explanation for
this, and I don't even try.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:90%
So the car keys are bent.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.280 align:middle line:90%
There they are.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:90%
You could see they're bent.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm pushing and pushing, because
you can't copy those things.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.580 align:middle line:10%
They're heavy.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.260 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really upset.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:10%
Because I got to use the car.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.650 align:middle line:10%
And I'm pushing the car key
in, and I finally get it in,

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.420 align:middle line:10%
but now it still doesn't go all
the way in without my really

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.220 align:middle line:10%
pushing it.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:10%
So consequently, I
call him in Israel

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:10%
and I say, you bent my car keys.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, you owe me.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what can
I do for you, Paola?

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Because he knows me really well.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.960 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, I know that
you won't come to the United

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.360 align:middle line:10%
States, but will you Skype
in from Israel November 1?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.940 align:middle line:10%
And I'm putting Russell Targ
on the stage who examined you

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.280 align:middle line:10%
at SRI, and you guys can
have a nice little reunion

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:10%
on the stage.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:10%
And he said, yes.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.620 align:middle line:10%
As long as I made a donation
to a children's hospital,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
which I will do,
because that's what--

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:10%
he doesn't need the money.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:10%
He wants to help.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:10%
So that is weirdness, OK?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:90%
That my car keys are bent.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.700 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there's a picture of
me when I was five years old.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.910 align:middle line:10%
I was born in Rome, 1945.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:10%
My father and our family,
that's my brother,

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:10%
came over on the boat to--

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.440 align:middle line:10%
I think we went
through Ellis Island,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:10%
but we landed in Canada first.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And then my father got a
job as the Italian council

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.160 align:middle line:10%
for the state of Rhode Island.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:10%
So my background is a
diplomatic background.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.950 align:middle line:84%
We lived in the diplomatic
circles of Rhode Island

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%
during the Kennedy days.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.100 align:middle line:10%
So my thinking about diplomacy--

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.830 align:middle line:10%
and I'm a part of
Exopolitics-- now

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:10%
has graduated into
intergalactic diplomacy.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's like I have
that kind of background.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, because that's
where I came from.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.100 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I was born in Rome.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.410 align:middle line:90%
And I went back to Rome in 1994.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.900 align:middle line:84%
I taught at the-- you'll
see at the American Overseas

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:90%
School of Rome, there I am.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:90%
This was weird too.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
My father was dying of cancer,
because he was a chain smoker,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.160 align:middle line:84%
like most Italians
were in those days.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And I decided I'm going to
leave everything and go back

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
to Italy to be with him.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
And I needed a job, and I went
into the American Overseas

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:84%
School of Rome, which is the
oldest private school in Rome.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And they offered me a job as
principal, not even a teacher.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And I go, uh, first
day, principal?

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I thought, uh, well, um.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, the school had
problems in that they told me

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:90%
never ever to talk about UFOs.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And the kids found
out about my website,

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and I was called down
to the administration

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
several times about that.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So there I am with
the kids, teaching.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
A beautiful school with
beautiful landscaping.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:90%
Teaching high school.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Taught honors high
school, taught history.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I
could teach history,

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I know the dates of
everything, and how

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.750 align:middle line:84%
I can place it on a
timeline has greatly

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:90%
influenced the way I view UFOs.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
When I was talking on the panel
about the 1950s and the Giant

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Rock Era, and
[INAUDIBLE],, and Adamski.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, Adamski's real.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
I did so much
research on Adamski.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I talked to his family.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:90%
I talked to people.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
He's buried in Arlington
National Cemetery.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.830 align:middle line:90%
He talked to John F. Kennedy.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.770 align:middle line:84%
The message is with Adamski
and Eugenia [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's another presentation.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Eugenia [INAUDIBLE]
concurrent with Adamski.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] living on
the island of Sicily.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:84%
These beings that have one-piece
blue outfits that say they

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:90%
come from Venus.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Go visit him too.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.420 align:middle line:90%
They visit Adamski.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] put his foot
down in the dirt there.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And George Hunt Williamson
made plaster casts.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:90%
Seven people were there.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And our field just ignores
that whole story of 1952.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Ridiculous.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Space people were coming here
right after the atomic bomb

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:90%
situation to give us a choice.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:84%
We have a war economy, and
we make money on this planet

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
by war and reconstruction,
war and reconstruction.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.200 align:middle line:90%
This is what Adamski said.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:84%
But in the '50s, the late '50s,
especially around Kennedy time,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
we had a chance to
have a space economy.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:90%
You know how much money comes--

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
they're making it now.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The industrial complex
is out in outer space,

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
because it's making money.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Not just because they
want to do "Star Trek."

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:90%
It's making money.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.870 align:middle line:84%
All the things that you
need to go to outer space

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
is a technology
that makes money.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:90%
In the '50s, we had that choice.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.160 align:middle line:84%
It was part of the
history of the '50s.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:90%
Guess what we chose?

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%
War.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make more
wars, or the economy

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:90%
doesn't keep going.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Adamski's message was,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
so he had to go to
the queen of Denmark.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:84%
He went to Pope John XXIII,
who was waiting for him,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
because he had a contact
in Castel Gandolfo.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
If you study this, you know
that whoever's visiting--

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many, and they
all have different agendas.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the '60s and the
'50s, this was the agenda.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.057 align:middle line:90%
You want to destroy yourselves?

00:20:18.057 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:90%
You've got a choice.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know you run on money,
we know you run on an economy.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Change the economy,
for god's sakes,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
to do war forever

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's a game of chess.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.460 align:middle line:84%
The only way we're even alive
is because they're playing chess

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:90%
and we are now at checkmate.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:90%
They have enough.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:90%
We have enough.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Checkmate.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Somebody gets more, and they
do the pressing of the button.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:90%
Toast.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's darn serious.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say ufology,
or this subject matter,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:90%
is very important.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
So my students, one or two
of them, that have come

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and that are still knowing
what I'm doing, sending me

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.180 align:middle line:90%
photographs.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.550 align:middle line:90%
This is Lake George.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And notice the second from
the last on the bottom

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:90%
has this thing in it.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
So Ben writes and says, we're
not interested in this stuff,

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and I took six
consecutive pictures,

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.590 align:middle line:84%
so what the heck is
this thing doing there?

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it?

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:90%
Can you predict?

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And no, they're not
even interested.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:90%
But he sends it to me.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
He says, Mrs. Harris,
he said, my god,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:90%
he says, you were right.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.120 align:middle line:90%
So he said, all right.

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:25.920 align:middle line:10%
So you know.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:10%
This is my apartment
in Rome on the left.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.550 align:middle line:10%
And as I said on
the panel, I've had

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:10%
Linda Howe as a guest twice.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:10%
I've had Travis Walton twice.

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:10%
I've had Richard Dolan come.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:10%
I've had Jesse Marcel, Junior.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And I can have conversations
with all my colleagues

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.750 align:middle line:84%
there, because I
gave them my bedroom

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and I paid for their
way across the ocean

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:90%
to speak to the Italians.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, I've been like
a bridge or a helpmeet.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.840 align:middle line:10%
And then when I moved back
to the United States in 2007,

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.710 align:middle line:10%
I think they were a little
surprised that I came forward

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.210 align:middle line:10%
with my research.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
On the right-hand side
is my office in Rome.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.380 align:middle line:10%
And there's Paul
Davids and Joan Ocean.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if you
know Joan Ocean.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:10%
I invited them over.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:10%
And I have so many pictures
of everybody there.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:10%
And of course, I'm hanging out.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:10%
My apartment is one
block from the Vatican,

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.710 align:middle line:10%
so I got to take a
picture of the pope.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm a photojournalist.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's some other
people and the Pope with me.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:90%
And Steve standing.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Steve is really a riot.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:10%
He didn't want to go
around Rome and walk,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:10%
and I got a taxi,
just took him around,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.563 align:middle line:10%
said, you stand next
to every monument,

00:22:40.563 --> 00:22:42.480 align:middle line:10%
because you tell everybody
that you were here.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:10%


00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And that's Ryan Wood who wrote
a book called "Majic Eyes" only

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.970 align:middle line:10%
that has 93 crashes.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:10%
There was not just
Roswell, people.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.820 align:middle line:90%
He has 93 different crashes.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
He did the research
all around the world.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
The Americans were the first
ones to have to clean it up.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Or they come in because
they want the stuff.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.860 align:middle line:90%
But there's 93 crashes.

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:84%
There I am with
Colonel Philip Corso.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I do believe that
something magical could

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.700 align:middle line:90%
happen when you read a book.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.007 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's the new
generation that is not reading.

00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going on internet
and getting stuff,

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and they're not getting
the academic stuff

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
that we need for them
to use their mind.

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
They're using the
sensationalist stuff,

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that's exciting
and like a conspiracy theory.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And they're spending their
whole time in that mind space.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
But these are my
books, and they've

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
been printed in
Italian and Spanish.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:10%
But this is the guy.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:40.820 align:middle line:10%
This is Jacques VallÃ©e.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.260 align:middle line:10%
And he's written
all those books,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:10%
but the ones that
changed my life

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.520 align:middle line:10%
are "Forbidden
Knowledge," this one.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And god, I took a
highlighter and went crazy,

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.120 align:middle line:84%
because it was all the answers
that I was looking for.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Because he's a world traveler
and he does field research.

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So he really has his
own theories about this.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.470 align:middle line:90%
But it's serious research.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And he really goes
after the skeptics.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And he's encouraging
researchers to be more

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.305 align:middle line:90%
diligent with what they do.

00:24:18.305 --> 00:24:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
know history too.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
You have to know history.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:21.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:90%
Now Elvis.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:90%
I got a--

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.465 align:middle line:90%
I was an Elvis groupie.

00:24:29.465 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I was an Elvis groupie at the
last two years of his life.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't the kind
of person that was--

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go crazy.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:90%
I just was very fascinated.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.340 align:middle line:84%
I used to sit by the
stage, and "2001--

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Space Odyssey" used to come out.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, why
is he using 2001?

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And then I noticed he had the
Mayan calendar on his outfit.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And that is not by
accident, people.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.760 align:middle line:90%
He was amazing.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.910 align:middle line:84%
He not only wanted
to know about UFOs,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.580 align:middle line:84%
he thought he was
somebody special.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I think he's somebody super
special that kind of went off

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
on a road he shouldn't
have gone off on.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And in 1977, I began to
not only follow Elvis,

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
because he was really, by
that time, in tough shape.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.948 align:middle line:84%
I was with his entourage,
who used to tell me about him

00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and what he was
reading when he died.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:84%
He was reading a book
on the Shroud of Turin.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So they told me his interest
in the metaphysical.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.710 align:middle line:90%
He even went to see Maharishi.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:40.030 align:middle line:90%
He looked for the truth in life.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided I was
going to get close to Elvis.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know if you can
see on the right-hand corner--

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:46.450 align:middle line:10%
I don't have a pointer--

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.320 align:middle line:10%
there is like a picture frame
and somebody lifting a picture

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:10%
frame.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.960 align:middle line:90%
I handed it to Elvis.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.920 align:middle line:84%
It was a picture of him
with his gun collection

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.790 align:middle line:84%
when he was very,
very, very young.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And he was very-- he stopped
everything on the stage,

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and he said, is this me?

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes, this was you.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.560 align:middle line:90%
And he handed me a white scarf.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.600 align:middle line:10%
But that white scarf was the
beginning of the beginning,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:10%
because I had that white
scarf around my neck

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.140 align:middle line:10%
and I took it home.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:10%
And then when he died in
1977, I waited a whole year

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:10%
before going down to pay
my respects to the grave.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.020 align:middle line:10%
I went with two older ladies.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking through
the gates of Graceland.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.120 align:middle line:90%
And somebody almost hits me.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.650 align:middle line:90%
I mean, she's five minutes--

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:84%
a red sports car
almost hits my leg.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:10%
And she jumps out of the
sports car and she says to me,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:10%
oh, I'm Donna, I'm
Elvis's first cousin,

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.200 align:middle line:10%
I am so sorry I
almost killed you.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, I'm
coming to pay respects,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.220 align:middle line:10%
but I'm telling you I had
a strange dream before I

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.240 align:middle line:10%
came here.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:10%
It was the only dream I
remember in full color.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Just before I went
there, I dreamt--

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.670 align:middle line:90%
and I remember waking up crying.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I dreamt about a structure
that had yellow shag carpeting.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:15.060 align:middle line:90%
It looked like a mobile home.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And it had a long
driveway that was all--

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.890 align:middle line:90%
you know those stones?

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I dreamt that I
walked in, and there was Elvis,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and he was hugging two
people I never saw.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I hate dreaming about
people I never saw before.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
A woman with curly, curly
gray hair, a tall, skinny guy.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And he hugged them and
he said to the guy,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.500 align:middle line:90%
you doing a good job, Al.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.928 align:middle line:90%
I thought it was Al.

00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And then he turns
around to me and he

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
says, the concerts
are over, start

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.127 align:middle line:90%
walking the way of the Lord.

00:27:48.127 --> 00:27:49.752 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:27:49.752 --> 00:27:50.990 align:middle line:90%
I've been having a good time.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know you
were so religious.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.480 align:middle line:84%
He said, walk the way
of the Lord, girl.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I remember those words.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.850 align:middle line:90%
So I called my friends.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:01.270 align:middle line:90%
I said, I had this weird dream.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.390 align:middle line:90%
He said, the concerts are over.

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:08.260 align:middle line:10%
When this girl almost hit
me, she said, my mother

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:10%
is Nash Pritchett.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:10%
She is the sister of
Vernon, Elvis's father.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.230 align:middle line:84%
She has a church,
a Baptist church,

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.900 align:middle line:84%
somewhat in Mississippi,
which is over the borderline.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.650 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
come to the church?

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my friends are
hitting me, going, yes, we

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:25.760 align:middle line:90%
want to meet the family.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Say yes, yes, yes.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.340 align:middle line:90%
So we drive the next day.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.585 align:middle line:90%
And there is the driveway.

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:35.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.640 align:middle line:84%
And the church is in a mobile
home that Elvis gave her.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I walk in.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:40.490 align:middle line:90%
I sit on the pews.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I open up the prayer book.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.767 align:middle line:84%
And there's "Walk the Land
of the Lord" right there,

00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:45.710 align:middle line:90%
the words he told me.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I sit down right
away, and I go, I

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:90%
don't know what I'm doing here.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And this woman comes up
with curly, curly gray hair,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and it's the woman in the dream.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.220 align:middle line:84%
So I go through the
whole ceremony with them,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.592 align:middle line:84%
and at the very end,
I walk up to her.

00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:02.300 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know
what I'm doing here,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I said, but I don't
ever have these dreams.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I said, he hugged you and this
other guy that's very tall.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you're
doing a good job, Al.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.640 align:middle line:90%
And she started to tear up.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said, can you
come to Graceland?

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:16.760 align:middle line:90%
That's my husband, Earl.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in Southern drawl,
Al and Earl are like the same.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And she said,
could you tell him?

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.490 align:middle line:10%
He's been in depression
ever since Elvis died.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:90%
So I get to Graceland.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I stand on the other
side of the pool,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and this guy comes
down from the lawn.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.625 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Earl, Elvis said
you're doing a good job.

00:29:37.625 --> 00:29:40.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.040 align:middle line:84%
From that point on, they
came to my house in Boulder.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.430 align:middle line:84%
They invited me and my mother
to dinner in Graceland.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And I got to go to the grave
without thousands of people

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:84%
to pay my respect
to Elvis Presley.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you don't
think that's weird,

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what-- anyway.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to add one thing
at the end of my slideshow.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:84%
The debut of History's
"Project Blue Book"

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.915 align:middle line:84%
came out January 8,
Elvis's birthday.

00:30:10.915 --> 00:30:14.502 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.502 --> 00:30:15.454 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:30:15.454 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:90%
I thought, oh, no.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.350 align:middle line:90%
How is this going?

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:20.630 align:middle line:90%
So there I am.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
This is how my career
started, "Close Encounters."

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
There's Francoise
Truffaut, whom I loved,

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.250 align:middle line:90%
because I loved that character.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:30.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I get to meet
Jacques VallÃ©e later on.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:10%
But here he is, you know,
"What Made You Do This?"

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:10%
I was a mother with two
young children, 11 and 12.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:37.910 align:middle line:10%
And I saw the movie.

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.360 align:middle line:10%
I began to cry with the
contact scene in the end.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.030 align:middle line:10%
But mostly, I was
teaching science fiction.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.738 align:middle line:90%
They had given me this class.

00:30:45.738 --> 00:30:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, this is perfect.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:84%
I'll make everybody go to
this movie and "Star Wars,"

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and then we could do
a class real easy.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.850 align:middle line:84%
The class went from
38 kids to 187.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.480 align:middle line:10%
And I got pulled in, if you read
my books, by the local pastor,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:10%
who said, this
class cannot be 187,

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:10%
because you must be doing
something that's the work

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.780 align:middle line:10%
of the devil.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:90%
It's in my connecting the dots.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.313 align:middle line:84%
And my principal said, no, she's
teaching kids how to think.

00:31:15.313 --> 00:31:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just telling
you, if you're

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.650 align:middle line:84%
a teacher or anything
like that, kids

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
will lock onto science
fiction to go here.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the pastor
wanted all my books,

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
so I gave it to him so
he could censor them.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.590 align:middle line:90%
And the way that we agreed--

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:84%
you know, I gave him
"Dune," I gave him HG Wells,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and I gave him all the
classics that I was teaching,

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:38.840 align:middle line:84%
because that is an in to the
young people, which I hope

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.070 align:middle line:90%
somebody takes on here.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.450 align:middle line:10%
Because if you look at who
comes to these conferences,

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:44.570 align:middle line:10%
they're 60 years and above.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And I keep thinking
to myself, we're

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:10%
all going to be gone in
maybe, like, 20 years.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.230 align:middle line:10%
What's going to
be left in ufology

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.070 align:middle line:10%
if we don't get a clue here?

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.620 align:middle line:84%
We've got to ask the young
people to think and to do this.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.510 align:middle line:10%
So what happened was,
I've got to tell you,

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.670 align:middle line:10%
the principal agreed
and the pastor

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:10%
agreed if I would start
my class with "this

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:10%
could be the work of the
devil," I could do the class.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, did I do it?

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:12.720 align:middle line:84%
I did it for three
times, and then

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.000 align:middle line:84%
everybody was laughing
every time, so I stopped.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.950 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, come on.

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:23.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is HG Wells,
Hyman, Arthur C. Clarke.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
They're classic authors.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a
literature freak.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.960 align:middle line:84%
So skeptics who flatly
deny the existence

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.590 align:middle line:84%
of unexplained phenomenon
in the name of rationalism

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.380 align:middle line:84%
are among the primary
contributors to the rejection

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:90%
of science by the public.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.280 align:middle line:84%
People are not
stupid, and they know

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.120 align:middle line:84%
very well when they have seen
something out of the ordinary.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the so-called
experts tell them

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that the object must have
been the moon or a mirage,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:53.490 align:middle line:84%
he is really teaching
that the public,

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:56.220 align:middle line:84%
that science is impotent
and unwilling to pursue

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.110 align:middle line:90%
the study of the unknown.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he is a genius.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:02.610 align:middle line:90%
What a guy.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this man has
a John Mack vibration.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Very, very kind.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Very, very, very rational.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Very rational.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But he also was part
of that 1970s attempt

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.150 align:middle line:84%
by Allen Hynek, Gordon
Cooper, Lisa Speigel

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to open up the question
at the United Nations.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.300 align:middle line:90%
They tried, OK?

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.100 align:middle line:90%
They tried.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:84%
Grenada tried because
it's a small country that

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.710 align:middle line:84%
needs to do it to
bring the resolution.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Grenada was a small country, but
when Sir Eric Gairy went back,

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.180 align:middle line:10%
there was a coup d'etat.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:10%
We tried to do it
with Colonel Corso.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.455 align:middle line:10%
And I don't have
time to tell you

00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:40.860 align:middle line:10%
about my life with
Colonel Corso.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.520 align:middle line:84%
We tried to do it in San Marino
where Colonel Philip Corso, who

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.800 align:middle line:84%
was RND at the Pentagon, who
wrote "The Dawning of a New

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:90%
Age" but with Bill Burns.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.740 align:middle line:90%
It was the day after Roswell.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We tried to do it from
San Marino, which is

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.120 align:middle line:90%
like Grenada, a small country.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't get into the United
Nations, where it belongs.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.440 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't get there.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:90%
This is what Allen said.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.990 align:middle line:90%
That's my picture of Allen.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.880 align:middle line:90%
So what happened?

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, I saw
"Close Encounters."

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.920 align:middle line:84%
There's a wedding in
Evanston, Illinois.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking really fast because
I have so much information.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.820 align:middle line:84%
I go to the wedding,
and I say to my family,

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going over to
Center for UFO Studies.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book was finished.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:21.578 align:middle line:90%
Blue Book finished in 1969.

00:34:21.578 --> 00:34:23.660 align:middle line:90%
It was '52 to '69.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.460 align:middle line:90%
It was finished.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is 1980 when "Close
Encounters" is there.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:31.247 align:middle line:84%
And I go in there thinking, I'm
never going to see this guy,

00:34:31.247 --> 00:34:32.580 align:middle line:90%
but I want to see all the files.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I want to open up the
drawers and look at all this.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guy comes out with a
pipe, walks around the corner,

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
looks at me, and says, I
heard you speak Italian.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to work with me?

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, oh, my god!

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to work with, like,
the godfather of ufology?

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And consequently, my
life with Allen Hynek

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
was amazing, because I
got to know his family.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll see pictures
of me with my kids.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got to see
that this was real.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:90%
This is not religion.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's ridiculous
for people to say,

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:06.520 align:middle line:84%
do you believe in UFOs if
the Air Force is studying it?

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe?

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.403 align:middle line:84%
What are they, going to
believe in something there

00:35:09.403 --> 00:35:12.510 align:middle line:84%
that if it's not there,
they're spending all this money

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to study something
that's stupid?

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:90%
What are people thinking?

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.955 align:middle line:90%
Do you believe?

00:35:19.955 --> 00:35:21.330 align:middle line:84%
It's different if
you ask, do you

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
believe if UFOs are
interplanetary craft?

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.067 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:35:26.067 --> 00:35:26.900 align:middle line:90%
But do you believe--

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:27.700 align:middle line:90%
UFOs are real.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's get over it.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what they
all are, because they're

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.510 align:middle line:90%
all a bunch of things.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.230 align:middle line:90%
But they're real.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.197 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm with a guy
that's an astronomer,

00:35:37.197 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and I'm walking down the street.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.310 align:middle line:84%
I remember he was
wearing that hat.

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You can see I started out
as an outright debunker,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.790 align:middle line:84%
taking great joy
in cracking what

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:47.680 align:middle line:90%
seemed to be puzzling cases.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.050 align:middle line:84%
I was the archenemy of
those flying saucer groups

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and enthusiasts like us,
who very dearly wanted UFOs

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:90%
to be interplanetary.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.110 align:middle line:84%
My own knowledge of those
groups are almost entirely

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:84%
what I heard from
Blue Book personnel.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So the Air Force was
brainwashing him.

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.540 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Ooh, they were all
crackpots and visionaries.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.660 align:middle line:84%
My transformation--
thank god for anybody

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:90%
who changes their mind.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Just hug them, please.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Because that means
they've graduated.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:90%
"My transformation was gradual.

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:22.060 align:middle line:10%
By the late '60s,
it was complete.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Today I would not spend
one further moment

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.430 align:middle line:84%
on the subject of UFOs if
I didn't seriously feel

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:90%
that the UFO phenomena is real.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And the efforts to
investigate, and understand it,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.220 align:middle line:84%
and eventually to solve it could
have a pro--" now, remember,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.460 align:middle line:84%
these are the important words
if you're a word person.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.280 align:middle line:10%
"--could have a
profound effect perhaps,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:47.140 align:middle line:10%
even be the springboard
to mankind's outlook

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.000 align:middle line:10%
on the universe."

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.240 align:middle line:90%
This is an astronomer.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.150 align:middle line:90%
He's not a crackpot.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So when your friends
and family tell you

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that you're crazy for
going to these things,

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.870 align:middle line:84%
we just say, excuse
me, [LAUGHS] do you

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.040 align:middle line:84%
have a level of knowledge where
you can discuss this with me?

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't, I don't
want to have this discussion.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.300 align:middle line:90%
This is an astronomer.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And not only did he-- you've
been watching the "Blue Book"

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.560 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:16.770 align:middle line:10%
It's a little bit hyped,
but there's Allen.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.510 align:middle line:10%
There's me with
Allen on the bottom.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's a beautiful
portrait of Mimi and Allen

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.410 align:middle line:90%
that I took in Santa Fe.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But Mimi is not
like the movie, you

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.500 align:middle line:90%
know, the "Project Blue Book."

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.120 align:middle line:84%
She was not a
housewife-y type person.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Mimi Hynek, Allen's
wife-- how many people

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.810 align:middle line:84%
are watching the
History Channel thing?

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.620 align:middle line:84%
She basically was
interested in archeology.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.770 align:middle line:84%
Like, Allen would go
with me to do research,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.140 align:middle line:90%
and she'd go to a doll museum.

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she was an
intellectual who

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:48.450 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do elder hostel
digs and stuff like that.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.320 align:middle line:90%
She was wonderful.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:10%
And there's Paul
Hynek on the left.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.140 align:middle line:10%
There's Paul.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:10%
That's their
youngest little boy.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:10%
He is basically, with
Joel, his brother,

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.370 align:middle line:10%
a consultant on the "Blue
Book" show on Tuesdays.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:04.470 align:middle line:10%
There I am with Mimi, his wife.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.538 align:middle line:10%
A young Paola Harris.

00:38:05.538 --> 00:38:07.080 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I was totally
different then.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.900 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Because there was APRO.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.200 align:middle line:84%
There was MUFON,
and there was CUFOS.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.160 align:middle line:10%
These organizations are
ever so important, people.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.660 align:middle line:10%
You should be supporting them,
because they're the only ones

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.580 align:middle line:10%
that are collecting sightings.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Nobody else is bothering
with them right now.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And these organizations
are keeping the data going.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have any data.

00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:35.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was in CUFOS,
Center for UFO Studies.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:90%
There I am with the secretary.

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.260 align:middle line:90%
There I am on the top.

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.370 align:middle line:90%
I have the red jumpsuit.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:46.110 align:middle line:84%
My daughter is the little
one with the pink--

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:47.640 align:middle line:90%
she's got the pink shirt.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:51.090 align:middle line:10%
And there I am with my
boyfriend at the time.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:54.000 align:middle line:10%
And there's the article that
came out in "The Denver Post"

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:10%
that we should study
this seriously.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.230 align:middle line:10%
Because I was a teacher,
so I could do it.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:02.340 align:middle line:10%
There I am with my son and
daughter in those days, 1980s,

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.500 align:middle line:10%
and my boyfriend,
and John Timmerman,

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.140 align:middle line:10%
who was the funder
for the center.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.530 align:middle line:10%
None of this can be
done without money.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.210 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing it from my own
pocket, which is crazy.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.550 align:middle line:10%
It's nuts.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.800 align:middle line:10%
But he needed funding,
Allen, and that

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:19.350 align:middle line:10%
was John Timmerman,
who just passed away.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.150 align:middle line:10%
There I am with Roberto
Pinotti, our MUFON guy.

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.910 align:middle line:10%
And it's called [INAUDIBLE]
Centro Ufologico Nazionale.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:31.620 align:middle line:10%
And Allen had asked me to bring
Roberto to the United States.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.580 align:middle line:90%
There I am with--

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.630 align:middle line:90%
that's the real Mimi Hynek, OK?

00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:37.200 align:middle line:90%


00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.560 align:middle line:10%
I miss these people, because
they were friends of mine.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:41.670 align:middle line:10%
They're part of my family.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.300 align:middle line:10%
And they aren't here anymore.

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.120 align:middle line:90%
So there I am with Allen.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.590 align:middle line:90%
He had just gotten cancer.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Allen died in 1986, by the way.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
When he got the brain tumor,
we thought he'd make it.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And he'd call me all the
time and say, I'm walking,

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing this, I'm doing that.

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:10%
And then we just lost him.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.250 align:middle line:10%
And you can see him
with his arm up,

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.040 align:middle line:10%
saying, you know, I'm
going to beat this,

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to beat this.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And both Jacques and
I suffered over this.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.780 align:middle line:84%
This I can't show you, because
I don't trust the videos work.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.780 align:middle line:84%
But Spielberg was asked
at "Actor's Studio"--

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.780 align:middle line:84%
he was asked if he
believed in aliens.

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And because it was a child,
it was a young child,

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.300 align:middle line:84%
it was a girl that was
about 20, he looked at her

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and he said, all this stuff
about listening to the whispers

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.923 align:middle line:90%
and not the loud noises.

00:40:30.923 --> 00:40:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then he turned around
to her and he said, yes, I

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.245 align:middle line:90%
do believe in aliens.

00:40:34.245 --> 00:40:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:38.540 align:middle line:90%
So he knows.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.280 align:middle line:90%
OK, follow the mashed potatoes.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I said-- if
you watch "Close Encounters,"

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:46.490 align:middle line:84%
all of the psychic messages that
were given to the contactees

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:84%
were psychic messages
that came from Jacques.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Jacques
and Spielberg.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And said to him, how do I
get him to Devils Tower?

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, I can't just call him
up and say, go to Devils Tower.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So what had happened was that
Jacques gave Spielberg the idea

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that these psychic
messages could come

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and these people
would be confused.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And so here's Roy Neary
that's making it out

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:90%
of mashed potatoes.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Then he makes it out
of dirt, as you know.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:14.855 align:middle line:84%
And then he's looking
over at the television.

00:41:14.855 --> 00:41:16.640 align:middle line:84%
He connects one,
and one, and two.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.830 align:middle line:90%
He sees Devils Tower.

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.288 align:middle line:84%
He knows he's
supposed to go there.

00:41:19.288 --> 00:41:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The other one's an artist
that draws the mother

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of the boy that disappears.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.200 align:middle line:90%
She draws it as an artist.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Artists have the key.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.110 align:middle line:90%
They know what's going on.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So this is the story of how
I met Colonel Corso, which

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.030 align:middle line:90%
is another weirdness.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.100 align:middle line:90%
It's a weirdness major big time.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Here is Richard Sigismond, who
lived with Allen Hynek, who

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:39.170 align:middle line:90%
was a good friend of his.

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Allen used to come and
take naps on his couch

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.500 align:middle line:90%
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.330 align:middle line:84%
There's Richard,
and me, and Linda

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.850 align:middle line:84%
in the 50th anniversary
of Roswell, which

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.560 align:middle line:90%
is one huge party, by the way.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.998 align:middle line:90%
It's just a party.

00:41:49.998 --> 00:41:51.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody gets
dressed up as aliens

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.900 align:middle line:90%
and walks down the street.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Families come in
and buy alien junk.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:04.490 align:middle line:84%
As long as we do that, this
field will remain Disneyland.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.780 align:middle line:84%
There is none of
that at Starworks.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:09.130 align:middle line:90%
I just can't.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any little
gray alien statues.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.510 align:middle line:84%
The red carpet at Starworks
is the Hubble telescope photos

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.470 align:middle line:90%
from outer space.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is outer space.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.550 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, that was a party.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.660 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to go.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:84%
What had happened was my boss
in Italy, because remember,

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.445 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Italy in 1997, he goes,
you got to go to Roswell,

00:42:30.445 --> 00:42:34.070 align:middle line:90%
it's the 50th anniversary.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to talk to a
guy named Colonel Philip

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Corso, because we have
to do a story on him.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
I was writing for "Area
51" magazine at that time.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.200 align:middle line:10%
If you read my biography
and connecting the dots,

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.922 align:middle line:10%
I was undergoing depression
over a relationship breakup.

00:42:48.922 --> 00:42:50.630 align:middle line:10%
And I said, Mauricia,
I don't want to go.

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:51.680 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, sorry.

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:10%
He said, but this guy, the guy
with the beard, Sigismond's

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.380 align:middle line:10%
going to wait for you
at the airport where

00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:10%
they're going to take you there
and you got to do the story.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.460 align:middle line:90%
So I went there.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Horrible storms in Roswell.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.230 align:middle line:10%
Here's all the people.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:10%
There's Robert Dean.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.420 align:middle line:10%
There's, what's his
name, Peter Gersten.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.270 align:middle line:10%
By the way, even the lampposts
have, like, alien faces

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:10%
on them.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:17.203 align:middle line:10%
So what happens is that I get
to the media room in Roswell,

00:43:17.203 --> 00:43:18.620 align:middle line:10%
and I say, I got
to do this story.

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.298 align:middle line:10%
I'm from Italy.

00:43:20.298 --> 00:43:21.590 align:middle line:10%
I got to have a place to sleep.

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.215 align:middle line:84%
And they said, good
luck, all the rooms

00:43:23.215 --> 00:43:24.620 align:middle line:90%
have been booked since February.

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.590 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, go
to the phone book.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:28.740 align:middle line:90%
So I opened up the phone book.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.850 align:middle line:10%
The first place that I
get is the Sally Port INN,

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:33.320 align:middle line:10%
where everybody is.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:34.850 align:middle line:10%
They have a room
for three nights.

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.050 align:middle line:10%
It's the room next to
Colonel Philip Corso.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.200 align:middle line:10%
So I don't know that, because I
don't know what he looks like.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:10%


00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.660 align:middle line:10%
So I just throw my stuff-- and
I did all my own photography,

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and all my gear in the room.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:10%
I go to the Roswell
Museum, which you saw.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.780 align:middle line:10%
There's the museum.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:10%
He's doing a press conference.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.530 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing there, going, how
am I going to get this story?

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:10%
The whole world is here.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:02.190 align:middle line:10%
He was the biggest
story in 1997 ever,

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.910 align:middle line:10%
ever, ever, because
his book says

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:07.410 align:middle line:10%
the reason why it's a secret.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.500 align:middle line:10%
He was in charge of
research and development

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:10%
for the Army at the
Pentagon and had the tools.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:10%
He had a file with the real
artifacts for the army.

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:19.640 align:middle line:10%
Remember, it was
Army/Air Force in '47,

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.480 align:middle line:10%
so the Air Force had
their own little tool.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.480 align:middle line:10%
They had their own little
stuff, but they didn't

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.550 align:middle line:10%
have a Corso to talk about it.

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:10%
The Army did.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.120 align:middle line:10%
And Corso had these artifacts.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:34.070 align:middle line:10%
Instead, he went to, like Emery
says, big, top corporations.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:37.490 align:middle line:10%
And he told me he carried big
envelopes of money to pay them,

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.000 align:middle line:10%
so there'd be no paper trail,
to back-engineer this stuff.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.870 align:middle line:10%
So logically, I'm going,
oh, OK, that is the secret.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:10%
It's money.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.917 align:middle line:10%
It's in the military
industrial complex.

00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going
to tell-- you honestly

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.000 align:middle line:84%
think disclosure
is going to come

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.560 align:middle line:84%
from people that
are making money

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.540 align:middle line:90%
off this that is top secret?

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.670 align:middle line:90%
This is not about the aliens.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:00.140 align:middle line:90%
This is about the technology.

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.903 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
were all there.

00:45:01.903 --> 00:45:03.070 align:middle line:90%
And he was the biggest star.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's my
room next to Corso.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:90%
And he's doing this lecture.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing
there going, how am I

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:11.097 align:middle line:90%
going to get this story?

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
blond guy next to me.

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.670 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, you're from Italy.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.870 align:middle line:10%
He goes, ask my father
a question in Italian.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.370 align:middle line:10%
I said, that's your
father up there?

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.170 align:middle line:10%
He goes, yes.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:23.700 align:middle line:10%
He said he was the head
of intelligence in Rome.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.950 align:middle line:10%
His family's Sicilian.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.870 align:middle line:10%
He speaks perfect Italian.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.357 align:middle line:10%
And would you please--

00:45:28.357 --> 00:45:29.940 align:middle line:10%
and I said, no, I
don't want to do it.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.482 align:middle line:10%
So what he does is
he takes his hand,

00:45:31.482 --> 00:45:34.160 align:middle line:10%
and he shoves me right
in front of the cameras.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.260 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't like
attention like that.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.160 align:middle line:10%
So I have no choice.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:37.960 align:middle line:10%
I'm standing there.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:10%
All the cameras are on me.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:45.380 align:middle line:10%
So I say to him in Italian,
[SPEAKING ITALIAN],,

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.707 align:middle line:10%
the Santilli autopsy footage.

00:45:47.707 --> 00:45:49.040 align:middle line:10%
And I said it to him in Italian.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.560 align:middle line:10%


00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.190 align:middle line:10%
He speaks half
Italian-- you know,

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:55.330 align:middle line:10%
because he answers half
Italian and half English.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.980 align:middle line:10%
He said, you know, that's
very familiar stuff,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.680 align:middle line:10%
because one of the
things I had in the file

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:04.700 align:middle line:10%
that General Trudeau gave me
was the lens from the alien.

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.150 align:middle line:10%
He said, I had the
lens and aliens do not

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:10%
have big, black eyes.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.420 align:middle line:10%
Those are lenses
like collectors.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:16.100 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, he said it was
an extraterrestrial biological

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:17.630 align:middle line:10%
entity that flew the ship.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:21.750 align:middle line:10%
And it had no control
of anybody or anything.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.210 align:middle line:10%
It was like a little robot.

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.830 align:middle line:10%
And he said he
saw the autopsies.

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.140 align:middle line:10%
If you read my book,
"Conversations with Colonel

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.120 align:middle line:10%
Corso," the autopsy's in there.

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.347 align:middle line:10%
And he said, I had
that, because I

00:46:31.347 --> 00:46:32.930 align:middle line:10%
took it and I used
to walk up and down

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.000 align:middle line:10%
the halls of the
Pentagon with this thing.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.885 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
furniture in the dark.

00:46:38.885 --> 00:46:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes, well,
we back-engineered it

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:44.450 align:middle line:84%
for our soldiers in Vietnam
for night-screening devices.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.880 align:middle line:10%
So there he is.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:50.420 align:middle line:10%
Colonel Corso was
bashed by our own UFO

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:53.300 align:middle line:10%
community, who crucified him.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.345 align:middle line:90%
One of the people--

00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not going to
mention his name--

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.330 align:middle line:84%
that came to San Marino who
was introduced to Corso--

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:01.220 align:middle line:84%
and he's very famous--
walked up and said,

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:05.100 align:middle line:84%
you have ruined
ufology for all of us.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was under Corso's arm.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Corso turns around
to me and said,

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.580 align:middle line:84%
can you tell me, Paola,
what clearance he has?

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.800 align:middle line:10%
I said, no, he's just
jealous, Colonel,

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.990 align:middle line:10%
because that's the field.

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:19.520 align:middle line:10%
I said, just ignore him.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.430 align:middle line:10%
He's just jealous.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.588 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Paola,
was he there?

00:47:23.588 --> 00:47:25.130 align:middle line:10%
I said, no, he wasn't
there, Colonel.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.930 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't at the Pentagon.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.260 align:middle line:10%
So the problem is-- and
I've got to go really fast--

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.230 align:middle line:10%
was when Colonel Corso came
to that room that you saw,

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:35.180 align:middle line:10%
he didn't give me the
interview I wanted.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:84%
He didn't give me an interview
about back-engineering.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.170 align:middle line:90%
Later he did.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.910 align:middle line:10%
We brought him to Italy twice.

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:44.150 align:middle line:10%
He only spoke in Italy twice,
because there was a lawsuit

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:46.700 align:middle line:10%
against the day after Roswell.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And that's a way to shut him
down here in the United States.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.680 align:middle line:10%
So we got the
original manuscript

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.820 align:middle line:10%
called "Dawn of a New Age."

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:55.190 align:middle line:10%
If you want to read it,
go on Open Minds TV,

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:59.390 align:middle line:10%
and you can download
his typewritten words.

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:middle line:10%
So Colonel Corso
says to me, well,

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.040 align:middle line:10%
you know, Paola, I'm convinced,
with the thunderstorms,

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:09.320 align:middle line:10%
two crashed together, and
what happened is one ended up

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.315 align:middle line:10%
in White Sands in 1957.

00:48:11.315 --> 00:48:13.820 align:middle line:10%
And I said, how
do you know that?

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:10%
He says, because I saw it.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.200 align:middle line:10%
I said, you saw a UFO?

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.460 align:middle line:10%
He said, yeah, I was
the head of a missile--

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.120 align:middle line:10%
he was the head of
a missile battalion.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.410 align:middle line:10%
Our colleague said, you have
ruined ufology for all of us?

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:29.857 align:middle line:90%
This is where we're at.

00:48:29.857 --> 00:48:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, he was the head
of a missile battalion.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:32.740 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.295 align:middle line:90%
He went over to the craft.

00:48:34.295 --> 00:48:36.045 align:middle line:84%
He said it was appearing
and disappearing.

00:48:36.045 --> 00:48:39.230 align:middle line:84%
He threw some cactus under
it, and what had happened

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:41.690 align:middle line:84%
was it squashed the
cactus, so it was physical

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.490 align:middle line:90%
and it was interdimensional.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said, from
the left-hand side

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.720 align:middle line:84%
came a being that
walked over to him.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It was not a Grey,
so let's get off

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.150 align:middle line:84%
this Grey, Nordic,
reptilian thing.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:55.530 align:middle line:84%
It was a little person,
but it was not a Gray.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have shoved
all of these cultures--

00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Stone told me
he had a manual with 57

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:05.550 align:middle line:84%
different beings, because when
he went to crash retrieval,

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:08.060 align:middle line:84%
they had to open up the page
so they wouldn't kill the being

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.740 align:middle line:90%
when they were doing first aid.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And our field has marginalized
this to Greys, reptilians,

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.310 align:middle line:90%
and Nordics.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:20.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ignorance
level is amazing.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got to stop it, because
the little [INAUDIBLE] guy was

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.440 align:middle line:90%
a little red--

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:84%
he had red skin with
three protrubances.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Well, this guy looked like that.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.370 align:middle line:90%
He was small.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
But he had a silver
band with a red stone,

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.110 align:middle line:90%
which was an interface.

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:41.870 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Corso, typical
Sicilian, pulls out his gun,

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:47.870 align:middle line:84%
points it at the being,
and says, friend or foe?

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, Paola,
imagine what he said.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.980 align:middle line:84%
And I said he said
neither, which

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.560 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
Grant Cameron said,

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.600 align:middle line:84%
which is exactly what the
people that have studied this--

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.340 align:middle line:84%
they're not friends,
and they're not enemies.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.140 align:middle line:90%
They're just them.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.185 align:middle line:90%
Let's get this clear.

00:50:04.185 --> 00:50:06.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, the ignorance in
the field, as a teacher.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.280 align:middle line:90%
I can't-- you know, I cringe.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Because we're using
our yardstick of--

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:14.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, are
humans good or bad?

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.690 align:middle line:90%
You went to the planet.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Oh, they have a pedophile,
and they kill people,

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and they murder
people, and they--

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, are
humans good or bad?

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:27.390 align:middle line:90%
We got to stop those.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.460 align:middle line:84%
That's the question I
get asked the most--

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.557 align:middle line:84%
are aliens-- I feel like
saying, ask something else.

00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:35.640 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this being,
so it points to the being,

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because Colonel
Corso's got a Beretta.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And the being said,
look, the radar

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is interfering with
my guidance system.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:90%
So could you shut it down?

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.070 align:middle line:90%
So let me go.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:50.543 align:middle line:90%


00:50:50.543 --> 00:50:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And the being said,
would you like

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.502 align:middle line:84%
to come aboard and
look at the craft?

00:50:53.502 --> 00:50:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, years later
I'm talking about,

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.980 align:middle line:84%
if you heard me,
down in South America

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:02.010 align:middle line:84%
where seven young guys are
climbing aboard a craft

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that they've been invited
on in the Chilca Desert.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.380 align:middle line:90%
It's normal.

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you want to come
aboard the craft?

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And Colonel Corso turned
around to the being

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:84%
and telepathically--
actually, he verbally said it.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.447 align:middle line:90%
The being was telepathic.

00:51:13.447 --> 00:51:15.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, what do you
have to offer me?

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And the being said, a new
world if you could take it.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Those words have been hijacked
by some of my colleagues.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.962 align:middle line:10%
So Colonel Corso, who
doesn't have mercy on me,

00:51:27.962 --> 00:51:29.420 align:middle line:10%
because I don't
want this interview

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:31.370 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not going to
print it, because I said,

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Colonel, they're going
to make you look crazy.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:34.550 align:middle line:10%
I can't do it.

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:36.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to print this.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.370 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, Paola--

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.040 align:middle line:10%
he wrote it on a
napkin, and he said,

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.380 align:middle line:10%
what do you think this means?

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, I don't know
and I don't care,

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:48.230 align:middle line:84%
because I need the story that
my boss sent me to-- this

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.930 align:middle line:90%
is Paola growing up, OK?

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:52.672 align:middle line:84%
I need a story on
the back-engineering.

00:51:52.672 --> 00:51:53.630 align:middle line:90%
I want all the details.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:54.230 align:middle line:90%
I want the Pentagon.

00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I want who you were.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.530 align:middle line:10%
So this is what I get.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.720 align:middle line:10%
This is what my
mind cannot digest.

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Is he telling the truth?

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.770 align:middle line:90%
There he is with me in Rome.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I watched him.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:10.230 align:middle line:84%
If you read my books, I
even bodyguarded this man,

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.730 align:middle line:84%
because we were in
a car that I knew

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.910 align:middle line:84%
was going to go up in
a car bomb in a minute.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:17.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's Ursula
Andress with him,

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:20.870 align:middle line:84%
because I was teaching
Dimitri to get into Yale.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So Dimitri, who is the
son of Harry Hamlin,

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:29.360 align:middle line:90%
said, I'm interested in UFOs.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.070 align:middle line:10%
So I took Ursula and Dimitri.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.390 align:middle line:10%
And that other gentleman
that's with him is--

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:38.060 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't know Adamski
then is Desmond Leslie, who

00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.380 align:middle line:10%
wrote all the books of Adamski.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.880 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know who he was.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.580 align:middle line:10%
I was listening to them
talk, and they were saying

00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.780 align:middle line:10%
all these amazing things.

00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.100 align:middle line:10%
And I was too stupid.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.723 align:middle line:90%
This is the lack of education.

00:52:47.723 --> 00:52:49.890 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting there, going,
oh, this is really nice.

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And later on, I had to go
study who Desmond Leslie really

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:57.250 align:middle line:10%
was, an RAF pilot who
wrote the books of Adamski.

00:52:57.250 --> 00:52:59.087 align:middle line:84%
So there there's
my life with Corso.

00:52:59.087 --> 00:53:00.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you think that's weird?

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:02.277 align:middle line:84%
Somebody put me in the
room next to Corso.

00:53:02.277 --> 00:53:03.110 align:middle line:90%
I covered the story.

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:03.910 align:middle line:90%
I covered it well.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:04.860 align:middle line:10%
I did my job.

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:05.660 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Easter, I was with
him, and he told me

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:11.270 align:middle line:10%
about the psychic ability he
had to go through dimensions.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.330 align:middle line:10%
He also believed
in reincarnation.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.340 align:middle line:10%
He made us stop a car in
the middle of nowhere,

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:10%
walked over to a space, and
said, there was a battle here.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Look up [INAUDIBLE],, because I
was part of that battle, just

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.790 align:middle line:10%
like Patton, who believed
in reincarnation, OK?

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.940 align:middle line:10%
So it was really interesting.

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.790 align:middle line:10%
So is there dimensionality?

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:29.870 align:middle line:10%
Yes.

00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:32.038 align:middle line:10%
This guy said he could--
and I was afraid of him,

00:53:32.038 --> 00:53:34.580 align:middle line:10%
because when I opened the door
to call him for Easter dinner,

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.817 align:middle line:10%
he was meditating.

00:53:35.817 --> 00:53:38.150 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Paola, I was
looking into another dimension

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:39.290 align:middle line:10%
where I could see
some documents,

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:40.498 align:middle line:10%
but I couldn't pull them out.

00:53:40.498 --> 00:53:43.190 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to hear that,
OK, because that's, for me,

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:44.930 align:middle line:10%
too weird.

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.320 align:middle line:10%
Do I understand it?

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.120 align:middle line:10%
A little bit more.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.260 align:middle line:10%
He died in 1998,
and we are in 2018.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.870 align:middle line:10%
So I have grown since then.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:10%
Here's Jacques VallÃ©e.

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:58.640 align:middle line:10%
We are dealing with unrecognized
level of consciousness.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.310 align:middle line:10%
By the way, grad school in
ufology is consciousness.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.140 align:middle line:10%
You keep hearing the
word "consciousness."

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:10%
Please know that
that means that there

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:10.040 align:middle line:10%
is a force somewhere
independent of man,

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.900 align:middle line:10%
but closely linked to the Earth.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.110 align:middle line:10%
I do not believe anymore
that UFOs are simply

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.810 align:middle line:10%
the spacecraft from another
extraterrestrial visitors.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:22.100 align:middle line:10%
This notion is too simplistic
to explain their appearance,

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:24.140 align:middle line:10%
the frequency of
their manifestations

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.450 align:middle line:10%
through recorded history,
and the structure

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:30.740 align:middle line:10%
of the information exchanged
with them during contact.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:10%
So when I read that, I thought,
OK, he's got it, he's got it.

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.790 align:middle line:10%
Here I am, Clifford
Stone, 50th anniversary.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.080 align:middle line:90%
Really, really, really fast.

00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.835 align:middle line:84%
50th anniversary,
it's part of my job.

00:54:40.835 --> 00:54:41.960 align:middle line:90%
I got to go and film stuff.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Clifford Stone says to
everybody that's partying there,

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:48.920 align:middle line:84%
come to my house, I have
something to show you.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
anything, but I

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:52.910 align:middle line:84%
knew Clifford Stone
was crash retrieval.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And the only people
that went to his house--

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:59.450 align:middle line:10%
because I had my equipment with
me, I was photographing stuff--

00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:02.030 align:middle line:10%
was me and Vittorio
[INAUDIBLE] from Brazil.

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:03.830 align:middle line:10%
Two European journalists.

00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.150 align:middle line:10%
We're European.

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:07.650 align:middle line:10%
We're not partying
hardy in the bars, OK?

00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:10.560 align:middle line:10%
So what we did was we said,
we'll come to your house.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:14.270 align:middle line:10%
And I came there, and I started
filming everything he has

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:17.090 align:middle line:10%
on that coffee table,
which you cannot see.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:23.660 align:middle line:10%
What was on that coffee table
was a canister of 1950s--

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:27.710 align:middle line:10%
and I knew it was an old
label, but what I didn't know

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.790 align:middle line:10%
was that he had eight minutes of
the Holloman landing in there.

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.490 align:middle line:10%
Because I didn't know what
the Holloman landing was.

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:37.890 align:middle line:10%
So what I did is I
filmed everything,

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.920 align:middle line:10%
and I sent it FedEx
back to my boss,

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.440 align:middle line:10%
and my boss writes
and said, Paola,

00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.360 align:middle line:10%
did you see what he had
on that coffee table?

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.450 align:middle line:10%
I said, no.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:48.230 align:middle line:10%
I just do what I'm
supposed to do.

00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:49.430 align:middle line:10%
I'm just filming it all.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.010 align:middle line:10%
And he goes, go back
to Clifford and ask

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:54.560 align:middle line:10%
why he didn't show
you the first eight

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.490 align:middle line:10%
minutes of the landing of
the ETs who were not Greys--

00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:02.750 align:middle line:10%
they were Semitic-looking--
with President Eisenhower

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:03.930 align:middle line:10%
at Holloman Air Force Base.

00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:04.905 align:middle line:10%
So I call up--

00:56:04.905 --> 00:56:07.180 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, Clifford,
I was at your house.

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Remember, there are only
two of us that went.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:10.330 align:middle line:10%
Two of us.

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:11.130 align:middle line:10%
OK?

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.305 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you didn't show
me, you didn't tell me.

00:56:13.305 --> 00:56:14.180 align:middle line:90%
This is the Holloman.

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Go on Wikileaks and learn
what happened there.

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And Clifford, this
is what he told me.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:28.030 align:middle line:10%
He said, Paola, the intelligence
community gave me that.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.950 align:middle line:10%
They said if any
of the researchers

00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.240 align:middle line:10%
want to see it and ask to
see it, show it to them.

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.740 align:middle line:10%
But we're going to
tell you nobody's

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:39.370 align:middle line:10%
interested in the real stuff.

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.760 align:middle line:10%
I would have asked if
I knew what it was.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:45.432 align:middle line:10%
He was not allowed to
tell me what it was,

00:56:45.432 --> 00:56:47.140 align:middle line:10%
but if I had asked to
see it I would have

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:49.700 align:middle line:10%
seen history in the making.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:50.860 align:middle line:10%
I said, where is it now?

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.550 align:middle line:84%
He said, they came and took
it away from me the next day.

00:56:53.550 --> 00:56:55.660 align:middle line:84%
Just to show me
that the researchers

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.720 align:middle line:84%
are into the party party and
not into the research part.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:00.580 align:middle line:84%
They did not want to
go to Clifford Stone.

00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Me and [INAUDIBLE] are the
only ones who were going,

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, let's hear what he has
to say about crash retrieval.

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:07.990 align:middle line:90%
This happened.

00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:09.350 align:middle line:90%
He had the eight minutes.

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:10.910 align:middle line:90%
They took it away from him.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.110 align:middle line:10%
And I have the film
footage of me just.

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:15.460 align:middle line:90%
So what happens-- I'm looking--

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I want to get as many
stories as possible.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:18.850 align:middle line:90%
I have to fly back to Italy.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:20.110 align:middle line:90%
I look at the bookstore.

00:57:20.110 --> 00:57:21.550 align:middle line:10%
There's books by
Richard Hoagland.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.625 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have any
idea who he was.

00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:25.000 align:middle line:10%
The people at the
bookstore said,

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.750 align:middle line:10%
he's just moved to the
mountains of New Mexico.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:30.550 align:middle line:10%
He might see you.

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:31.690 align:middle line:10%
You might call.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:33.790 align:middle line:10%
And I called and I
said, Richard Hoagland,

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:35.530 align:middle line:10%
I am Paola Harris from Italy.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.778 align:middle line:10%
I don't know anything
about you, but can I

00:57:37.778 --> 00:57:39.070 align:middle line:10%
come up and just interview you?

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:40.210 align:middle line:10%
I'll figure out something.

00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.220 align:middle line:10%
I never read his books.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:46.120 align:middle line:10%
And he said, go to the
airport, sit on your suitcase,

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.450 align:middle line:10%
a green car will pull up,
you get in the green car,

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.310 align:middle line:10%
it will take you
to the mountains.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Any normal person
would not do that.

00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:55.005 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:55.005 --> 00:58:00.010 align:middle line:10%
So I went to the airport,
I sat on my luggage,

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:04.780 align:middle line:10%
the car pulled up, I got in
the car, I go to the door,

00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.110 align:middle line:10%
I say, I'm Paola Harris,
and he goes come in.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:08.860 align:middle line:10%
And he said, Ted
Koppel's going to call me

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:10.360 align:middle line:10%
in about five
minutes, because we're

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.142 align:middle line:10%
going to do a flyby of Sedonia.

00:58:12.142 --> 00:58:13.100 align:middle line:10%
I said, what's Sedonia?

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.938 align:middle line:10%


00:58:15.938 --> 00:58:17.980 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be questioning
Emery Smith later on,

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:20.320 align:middle line:10%
by the way, because I've
learned to ask good questions.

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.850 align:middle line:10%
The questions that
I asked Richard

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:24.290 align:middle line:10%
were so good that
I got a compliment.

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:27.910 align:middle line:10%
He said, when Ted Koppel called
back from "Nightline," he said,

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.670 align:middle line:10%
I'm here talking to one of the
most intelligent journalists

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:31.960 align:middle line:10%
I've ever spoken to.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Remember, I never knew
anything about this.

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:38.600 align:middle line:10%
And he said, and I'm
really honored to do it.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And then he took me to
dinner, and we're talking.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I find out everything, because
then I go read all the books.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:44.690 align:middle line:90%
And I bring him to Italy.

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:46.540 align:middle line:90%
And there he is in Italy.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.430 align:middle line:90%
One of the most brilliant men.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to
visit him, then he

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:51.640 align:middle line:90%
would invite me every summer.

00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:54.910 align:middle line:84%
He'd hand me five books, tell
me to go in the room, and read.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.070 align:middle line:90%
So I would do it.

00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:00.010 align:middle line:84%
The story I did with him,
very fast, with George Noory

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:05.230 align:middle line:84%
was that Vittorio Formisano,
our guy, Italy, Italian Space

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Agency, discovered formaldehyde
and ammonia on Mars.

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And so they wanted me to
go track down Formisano

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.050 align:middle line:90%
on the island of Ischia.

00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:14.860 align:middle line:84%
So my webmaster and I
jump on a hydrofoil,

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.547 align:middle line:84%
so that he can say to George
Noory, "Coast To Coast,"

00:59:17.547 --> 00:59:18.880 align:middle line:90%
we have discovered life on Mars.

00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:21.100 align:middle line:90%
Remember, it's not an American.

00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It's an Italian from the
Italian Space Agency.

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:28.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a NASA conference
I'm covering.

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.900 align:middle line:10%
I go into a jewelry store.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.970 align:middle line:90%
I see Formisano.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:32.703 align:middle line:84%
I'm Italian so I
go up to Formisano.

00:59:32.703 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:84%
I said, can you
give me the story?

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:39.190 align:middle line:10%
He said, well, sit in the front,
I'll go to the conference,

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:44.320 align:middle line:10%
and I will tell you,
after the conference,

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.450 align:middle line:10%
after I tell the world.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:48.070 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't
know if you know.

00:59:48.070 --> 00:59:49.630 align:middle line:10%
Ammonia is like urine.

00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Every 72 hours.

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:55.450 align:middle line:10%
You have something that's,
every 72 hours, refurbishing it.

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:57.770 align:middle line:10%
This is way back
when, by the way.

00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:58.570 align:middle line:10%
So here I am.

00:59:58.570 --> 01:00:00.740 align:middle line:10%
There's my webmaster,
there's the island of Ischia.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.980 align:middle line:84%
It's next to the
island of Capri.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.330 align:middle line:90%
There's Formisano.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:05.380 align:middle line:90%
He's standing there.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.180 align:middle line:90%
He does not talk.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:10.990 align:middle line:84%
There is all NASA guys there
in white shirts and ties.

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:12.740 align:middle line:90%
He walks in.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.630 align:middle line:90%
He does not open his mouth.

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:17.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced that
whoever's going

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:20.680 align:middle line:10%
to announce-- because
Formisano had a spectrometer.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.410 align:middle line:10%
That's how he found out about
this, his own spectrometer.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:25.060 align:middle line:10%
Italian Space Agency.

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:27.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm convinced that the Mars
thing has got to come out

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
of the United States.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.640 align:middle line:84%
There is politics
behind all this.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.585 align:middle line:90%
This is years ago.

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:34.460 align:middle line:10%
And then I said, why
didn't you say anything?

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.340 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well--

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.800 align:middle line:10%
what he didn't say was "they
told me not to open my mouth."

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.270 align:middle line:10%
But there's the conference.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.910 align:middle line:10%
He said, I have
to do peer review.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.880 align:middle line:10%
So this shows you what
field researchers--

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.430 align:middle line:10%
if I'm jumping on a hydrofoil
to go to the island of Ischia

01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.340 align:middle line:10%
to do a "Coast To Coast" show
for Richard Hoagland and Noory,

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.590 align:middle line:10%
and then I have to tell them
that night that he didn't

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:55.300 align:middle line:10%
speak, it was embarrassing.

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.540 align:middle line:10%
I did it but it
was embarrassing.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%
So there's Jacques.

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:04.350 align:middle line:84%
"My personal contention
is that the phenomenon

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:06.248 align:middle line:84%
is a result of an
intelligence--"

01:01:06.248 --> 01:01:08.290 align:middle line:84%
whether you call it God
or whatever you want to--

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:12.190 align:middle line:84%
"that it is a technology
directed by an intelligence

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and that this intelligence
is capable of manipulating

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
space and time in ways
that we do not understand."

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
We cannot explain
everything, people.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.830 align:middle line:10%
Our science can't explain how
ETs come through the wall,

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:27.020 align:middle line:10%
so why in the world are
we using our science?

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.020 align:middle line:10%
What happens is we got
to look at the phenomenon

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:30.250 align:middle line:10%
and redefine science.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.640 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that logical?

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.580 align:middle line:10%
I know what's happening here.

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.040 align:middle line:10%
The story, the 1945
crash in San Antonio,

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.650 align:middle line:10%
I've done this case
now for seven years.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have James Fox come,
because two little Mexican boys

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.690 align:middle line:90%
see a crash.

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.880 align:middle line:10%
One month after the
atomic bomb, they

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.520 align:middle line:10%
see the beings, they
go up to the craft,

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.960 align:middle line:10%
because it comes in
through a thunderstorm.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.750 align:middle line:84%
A piece gets taken
off of the side.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
They see the beings inside.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.850 align:middle line:10%
The two little boys are now
79, and one has passed away.

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Thank god I got
all his testimony

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.210 align:middle line:90%
before he passed away.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.490 align:middle line:10%
The only one who would go
down there and film this

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:09.510 align:middle line:10%
is James Fox.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:10.560 align:middle line:10%
God bless him.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.630 align:middle line:10%
He's bringing a
movie out that we're

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:15.540 align:middle line:10%
going to highlight
in 2020 in Laughlin.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.400 align:middle line:90%
He is the greatest filmmaker.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.290 align:middle line:90%
There is where the craft landed.

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:21.540 align:middle line:84%
You even have the
spot where it landed.

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.670 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking to
them about this case,

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:25.380 align:middle line:10%
and I'm working on this case.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.712 align:middle line:10%
And then I bring
everybody-- even Jan Harzan

01:02:27.712 --> 01:02:28.670 align:middle line:10%
was down there with me.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.000 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE] had a drone.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.430 align:middle line:10%
He covered the case.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.230 align:middle line:10%
We got a problem because in
this photograph in Laughlin

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.880 align:middle line:10%
when we presented
it, there is a face

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.740 align:middle line:10%
we do not recognize in the back.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.220 align:middle line:10%
Do you see that?

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.938 align:middle line:10%
So that's crazy.

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:44.480 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking at this photo,
and we say, who's back there?

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.120 align:middle line:10%


01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.260 align:middle line:10%
He wasn't there, OK?

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.260 align:middle line:10%
So what happened is I
ended up taking the photo

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.087 align:middle line:10%
to Jose Padilla, who was the
nine-year-old who's in his 70s.

01:02:55.087 --> 01:02:56.420 align:middle line:90%
He says, Paola, I know that guy.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do you
mean you know that guy?

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, I was
with my girlfriend

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:08.140 align:middle line:84%
in this place in Albuquerque,
this casino that's abandoned.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And this guy comes
up to me and he says,

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.040 align:middle line:90%
thank you for your service.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, the next
words out of his mouth,

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:20.333 align:middle line:84%
you know ETs are
walking among us?

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:21.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, it's that guy?

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.073 align:middle line:90%
And he said, yes.

01:03:22.073 --> 01:03:24.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, my girlfriend got so
scared she slept on my couch

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
that night.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
He said, I turned around
to invite him to lunch,

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and he disappeared.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So Jose recognized--
the paranormal.

01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, this story, Jose,
when he was nine years old,

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
saw a big monkey ape
jump over a fence.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
It was Bigfoot.

01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:42.217 align:middle line:84%
There's a portal there
where this happened.

01:03:42.217 --> 01:03:43.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, what do you mean an ape?

01:03:43.550 --> 01:03:44.770 align:middle line:90%
He goes, it was a big monkey.

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:48.400 align:middle line:10%
He says, my stallion
just roared up and he--

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.180 align:middle line:10%
around UFO stuff
happens weirdness.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.760 align:middle line:10%
And I'm glad Steve
Merritt talked about that.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.640 align:middle line:10%
When I went back to take all
the people back to-- this

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.720 align:middle line:10%
is Giant Rock in
Landers, California.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:04.660 align:middle line:10%
I do a whole presentation
on "Back To The Future,"

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.750 align:middle line:10%
because this is where the
real truth is, people.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.740 align:middle line:10%
The ETs, in some way, shape,
or form, in the 1950s and '60s

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:16.450 align:middle line:10%
tried to jump-start the New
Age movement in their ways

01:04:16.450 --> 01:04:18.170 align:middle line:10%
of getting to different people.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:22.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is Robert
Short doing a channeling

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.820 align:middle line:10%
that he used to do next to
Van Tassel, because Robert

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.700 align:middle line:10%
Short told me that,
originally, they

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:30.190 align:middle line:10%
used to speak to the
ETs on Crystal Radio

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.650 align:middle line:10%
until the FBI found out about
it, shut down the crystal

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:33.640 align:middle line:10%
radios.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.620 align:middle line:10%
And the ET that he
was involved with

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.560 align:middle line:10%
asked if he could use his
vocal chords so he could

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.090 align:middle line:10%
deliver messages to the world.

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.130 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Here we are.

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
David Garcia, who used
to work with me, he came.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And here's with Robert Short.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:53.220 align:middle line:84%
David Garcia is the only
one to photograph UFOs.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
We all have our cameras.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's Lori
that's filming, OK?

01:04:57.550 --> 01:04:59.800 align:middle line:90%
And I have the film footage.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:02.590 align:middle line:10%
The message that came
through his throat

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:05.380 align:middle line:10%
was, the end of separation.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Unless you species unite, we
don't even want to talk to you.

01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:11.170 align:middle line:10%
So the end of separation.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.520 align:middle line:10%
And this was night.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.630 align:middle line:10%
And it was 2014,
and they mentioned

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.010 align:middle line:10%
Vladimir Putin in that.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.790 align:middle line:10%
I said, why is he
mentioning Putin?

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.310 align:middle line:10%
I mean, who's-- we
never hear about him.

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.440 align:middle line:10%
In that channeling, do
you want to hear about it?

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.010 align:middle line:10%
You've got to read my book on
that, and then you'll see it.

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:29.830 align:middle line:84%
There's the UFOs in broad
daylight around Giant Rock.

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The message "the
end of separation."

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.890 align:middle line:10%
This is a message.

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:37.380 align:middle line:10%
Here's Kennedy, who
knew what was going on.

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Here I meet with Steven Greer,
and Robert Dean in Calabria.

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.970 align:middle line:84%
That's where I first
meet Steven Greer.

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:48.100 align:middle line:90%
You need to see this.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.830 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I know
Emery is because I

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
was a consultant on
"Sirius," the movie "Sirius."

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And those are
pictures Emery took.

01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
he was doing then.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.060 align:middle line:10%
He looked like a bodyguard.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.943 align:middle line:10%
We never talked about anything.

01:06:04.943 --> 01:06:06.110 align:middle line:10%
We were just doing the work.

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:07.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he was taking pictures.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.210 align:middle line:10%
We had nine box cameras.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:12.730 align:middle line:10%
He was taking pictures.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:14.290 align:middle line:10%
You know, he just was there.

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.343 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we never talked about
what we're talking about now.

01:06:17.343 --> 01:06:18.760 align:middle line:10%
But I thought you'd
be interested.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.980 align:middle line:10%
Those are two beautiful
pictures taken at Crestone.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.980 align:middle line:10%
How much time do I have?

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.900 align:middle line:10%
So I'm racing through this.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It's 20.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:25.360 align:middle line:10%
>> 20 minutes.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.160 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.050 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, I end up with
these distinguished gentlemen.

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:33.010 align:middle line:90%
There's Robert Dean.

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
There's Steven Bassett,
Steven Greer, Brian O'Leary,

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Nick Polk were all
in Barcelona, Spain.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:43.250 align:middle line:90%
And I'm the token woman.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So I'm
there with everybody.

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I told you that's
how I met Steven Greer.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.680 align:middle line:90%
I admire him.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry, but at least he
did The Disclosure Project.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.830 align:middle line:10%
People are not doing
anything except talking.

01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:59.110 align:middle line:10%
He did Disclosure Project,
the movie "Sirius,"

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.220 align:middle line:10%
"Unacknowledged."

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.190 align:middle line:10%
And when I met him, I had
to drag military people

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:05.770 align:middle line:10%
through a hotel
near Termini in Rome

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:08.620 align:middle line:10%
to do the interviews for
The Disclosure Project.

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.550 align:middle line:10%
Military people were lined up.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:15.850 align:middle line:10%
So to do the work, I admire
you, whoever you are.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.390 align:middle line:10%
And so I helped him with that,
because I knew the military.

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.070 align:middle line:10%
OK, follow the mashed potatoes.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.050 align:middle line:90%
I end up on the island of Ibiza.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know where Ibiza is.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.730 align:middle line:10%
This guy named
[INAUDIBLE] Appel Guery,

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.570 align:middle line:10%
who is the contactee from
Paris, has written a book

01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:34.960 align:middle line:10%
on the beings he encountered,
which are robotic beings that

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.100 align:middle line:10%
reconnect your circuits.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:37.898 align:middle line:90%
They reconnect your circuits.

01:07:37.898 --> 01:07:39.940 align:middle line:10%
This is the book they put
out for the people that

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:41.260 align:middle line:10%
understand French.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.830 align:middle line:10%
He wanted a briefing from me
on Colonel Corso, Michael Wolf,

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.090 align:middle line:10%
and Clifford Stone.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:47.770 align:middle line:10%
So he invites me down here.

01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:49.240 align:middle line:10%
They are in Ibiza.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.580 align:middle line:10%
This is the book on him,
what he went through.

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:53.950 align:middle line:90%
He's on this catamaran.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
ferry in the front.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:57.483 align:middle line:84%
You know, this
gorgeous catamaran.

01:07:57.483 --> 01:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And there's all
these boats docked

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.520 align:middle line:90%
in Ibiza, all these boats.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
And I come on.

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm on the port, and the
people that brought me there.

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:04.780 align:middle line:90%
And they paid my way.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:05.740 align:middle line:90%
I was really shocked.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm one of the only
people that they

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.270 align:middle line:10%
paid the way to go there
to do this briefing.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:13.180 align:middle line:10%
And in that boat is a living
room with white leather

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.860 align:middle line:10%
furniture that I've
never seen before.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.010 align:middle line:10%
And the woman that
brought me there says,

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:23.109 align:middle line:10%
you can't go there until
he decides to see you.

01:08:23.109 --> 01:08:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm walking around just
with all these wonderful people.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:27.550 align:middle line:10%
They're beautiful people.

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:31.010 align:middle line:10%
And all they do is
meditate to keep the energy

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.430 align:middle line:10%
in the Mediterranean.

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:36.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a life outside
the States, OK?

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:40.149 align:middle line:10%
There's also people that
are working at this, trying

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.670 align:middle line:10%
to make the energy for peace.

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.779 align:middle line:10%
And they're in
the port at Ibiza.

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:47.830 align:middle line:10%
And what happens-- I see this
guy with sideburns come down

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:48.880 align:middle line:10%
off the--

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:50.740 align:middle line:10%
you see the ferry.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.260 align:middle line:10%
She's a ferry that's in
the front of this thing.

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:54.490 align:middle line:10%
And he comes over.

01:08:54.490 --> 01:08:57.790 align:middle line:10%
And I have on a white
T-shirt my boyfriend

01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:02.500 align:middle line:10%
bought me with a big red heart
that's all beaded with a Cupid.

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.899 align:middle line:10%
He comes up to me, he
takes his necklace,

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.750 align:middle line:10%
it's got a Cupid
on it, and he said,

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:12.132 align:middle line:10%
I needed a sign this morning
to let you get on the boat.

01:09:12.132 --> 01:09:14.050 align:middle line:10%
Now, don't even tell me.

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:16.479 align:middle line:10%
I said, OK, so.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:18.460 align:middle line:10%
You've got to keep it,
I've got to keep it.

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, do you think
I even thought about it?

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:23.350 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.200 align:middle line:10%
It's now that I'm
thinking about it.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.210 align:middle line:10%
I haven't thought about it then.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.510 align:middle line:10%
It's just there he is.

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
There he is with me.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
There we are in
the port of Ibiza.

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:34.680 align:middle line:90%
And so I gave him a briefing.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.194 align:middle line:84%
And after that, I did it
for all of his people,

01:09:37.194 --> 01:09:38.819 align:middle line:84%
he walks over to me
and says, stay away

01:09:38.819 --> 01:09:40.529 align:middle line:84%
from the military
witnesses, Paola,

01:09:40.529 --> 01:09:44.700 align:middle line:84%
because your energy is going
to be lower if you keep just

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.710 align:middle line:90%
doing military witnesses.

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:50.729 align:middle line:84%
And he says, try
to, in other words,

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:53.279 align:middle line:90%
deviate from doing the military.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.630 align:middle line:90%
"Interdimensional Portal."

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:57.177 align:middle line:84%
This book, if you want
to read it, it's UK,

01:09:57.177 --> 01:09:58.385 align:middle line:90%
"Walking Between Two Worlds--

01:09:58.385 --> 01:09:59.970 align:middle line:90%
The Jason Andrews Story."

01:09:59.970 --> 01:10:04.740 align:middle line:84%
I have not talked to Jason
Andrews and his mother

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.240 align:middle line:90%
for seven years.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm putting together
this PowerPoint,

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and Jason Andrews asks for
my friendship on Facebook

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.250 align:middle line:90%
last week.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Last week.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I'm doing
it, this crazy story.

01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I wish somebody would cover it.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.590 align:middle line:90%
This house is on two Ley lines.

01:10:22.590 --> 01:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
She's telling me that when
they're shoeing horses,

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
they see a little girl
with a big bow dressed

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
in Victorian style
who's watching them

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
and that they have beings
coming out of the walls.

01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
But they're used to it.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And then she tells
me, and my relatives

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.575 align:middle line:84%
came for Christmas dinner
once, and they drove in,

01:10:40.575 --> 01:10:42.360 align:middle line:90%
and my house wasn't there.

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
There was a Victorian house
with a little girl on the swing,

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:47.322 align:middle line:90%
with a big bow.

01:10:47.322 --> 01:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And they called me
on the cellphone

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.300 align:middle line:90%
and said, where's your house?

01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And Ann says to them, no,
go back out the driveway.

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:55.430 align:middle line:90%
This is in Long Sutton.

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Somebody should
cover this story.

01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:01.712 align:middle line:84%
And she said, drive back
out and come back in.

01:11:01.712 --> 01:11:03.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.760 align:middle line:90%
They drive back out.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.290 align:middle line:90%
They came back in.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:07.280 align:middle line:90%
The house was there.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.347 align:middle line:84%
She tells me, there's
pterodactyls in their trees

01:11:11.347 --> 01:11:12.680 align:middle line:90%
when they're walking their dogs.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.490 align:middle line:84%
What dimensions are
merging on this house?

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:18.440 align:middle line:90%
I lasted 24 hours.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping in Jason's
room, who's the contactee.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
I heard my name called in
the middle of the night,

01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
and I heard footsteps all night.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.670 align:middle line:84%
I said, there's people
walking up and down.

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
She said, yes,
there's a man that

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:31.985 align:middle line:90%
lives in another dimension.

01:11:31.985 --> 01:11:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And I said, get me a hotel,
because I can't take this.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I will do your story,
but get me a hotel.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.080 align:middle line:90%
There's the house.

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:39.990 align:middle line:90%
There she is.

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
There's Ann and there's Jason.

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:43.835 align:middle line:84%
And there's the field
in front of them

01:11:43.835 --> 01:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that she says, do not
set foot in that field,

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.470 align:middle line:84%
because nobody
will cultivate it.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And there is the
field, but there's

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.920 align:middle line:90%
what lands in the field.

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:53.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's a real portal, OK?

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:54.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a real portal.

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, why don't
people cover these things?

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I can't because I
don't live in England

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not there long enough.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:04.420 align:middle line:84%
She wants me to
come back and visit.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
her house, though.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.670 align:middle line:90%
I will stay.

01:12:06.670 --> 01:12:09.430 align:middle line:90%
I can't take the ghosty stuff.

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:11.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's all together.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:13.630 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there's a UFO there
if you don't see that.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, here I am with Paul
Hellyer, the former defense

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.710 align:middle line:10%
minister.

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.590 align:middle line:84%
I get invited to his
90th birthday party.

01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:21.860 align:middle line:90%
He wants me to do a speech.

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what to say.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Here is the former Defense
Minister of Canada,

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.430 align:middle line:84%
just like McNamara was
during the Kennedy time.

01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:31.120 align:middle line:10%
So he said, everybody-- this
is just to show you the field.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Everybody's laughing
at me, he said.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:35.270 align:middle line:10%
These are all the
defense ministers.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.870 align:middle line:10%
And my involvement
with UFOs, he said,

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.103 align:middle line:10%
is making everybody laugh.

01:12:39.103 --> 01:12:41.020 align:middle line:10%
So he said, I'll give
you five minutes, Paola.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.120 align:middle line:10%
Please help me out.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.150 align:middle line:10%
So I said to the
people, can you tell me

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:50.200 align:middle line:10%
what's funny about a
pilot, [INAUDIBLE],,

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.780 align:middle line:10%
who I interviewed and
he's just passed away,

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:58.270 align:middle line:10%
who is with Air France and sees
a football-sized UFO over Paris

01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.608 align:middle line:10%
and has 300 passengers
in the back?

01:13:00.608 --> 01:13:01.900 align:middle line:10%
Will you want to laugh at that?

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.240 align:middle line:10%
And then I said, and do you
want to laugh at the fact

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.680 align:middle line:10%
that in 1969 there's
10 Minute Men

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.180 align:middle line:10%
missiles that are shut
down one after the other

01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.058 align:middle line:10%
after the other?

01:13:13.058 --> 01:13:15.600 align:middle line:10%
I said, don't you think that's
a matter of national security?

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.880 align:middle line:10%
These are facts.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880 align:middle line:10%
Nobody laughed.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.680 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.722 align:middle line:10%
And I could have gone on.

01:13:19.722 --> 01:13:23.820 align:middle line:10%
Just like Steven said
at the panel in Russia,

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.290 align:middle line:10%
they accelerated the pattern
to launch the missiles.

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:30.920 align:middle line:10%
Could you imagine if the ETs
had let the missiles launch out

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.750 align:middle line:10%
of Russia, what it
would have done?

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:34.603 align:middle line:10%
They stopped the sequence just--

01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:36.020 align:middle line:10%
what do you think
that message is?

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:40.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, does it take a rocket
scientist to figure this out?

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:41.222 align:middle line:10%
Shut down missiles when--

01:13:41.222 --> 01:13:43.180 align:middle line:10%
they didn't destroy them,
because they put them

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:46.240 align:middle line:10%
back up the next week.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.328 align:middle line:10%
You want to tell me?

01:13:47.328 --> 01:13:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't take
a rocket scientist.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.178 align:middle line:84%
There's Edgar Mitchell,
"The Way of the Explorer."

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Edgar Mitchell's talking to me.

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:55.440 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't think
humanity's ready for this.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.960 align:middle line:90%
I get invited to his funeral.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the VIP pass.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:59.560 align:middle line:10%
There's Jacques.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.270 align:middle line:10%
He thinks that this phenomenon--
and he does not call it ET--

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:07.120 align:middle line:10%
is meant to wake up
our consciousness.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
He does not call it ET.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Here I am with
Phyllis Schlemmer.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.060 align:middle line:90%
May I recommend this book?

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The "Briefing of the
Landing of Planet Earth."

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:16.460 align:middle line:90%
I read the book.

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.130 align:middle line:90%
It's got Uri Geller in it.

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I say, did you guys
really go to Israel

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
with Andrija Puharich
and Sir John Whitmore,

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and what's her name?

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.397 align:middle line:10%
She's passed on too.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.480 align:middle line:10%
She says, I'm coming to
Boulder to see you, Paola.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.350 align:middle line:10%
You're on to something.

01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:32.350 align:middle line:10%
So they come to Boulder.

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:33.847 align:middle line:10%
She does a channeling.

01:14:33.847 --> 01:14:36.180 align:middle line:10%
If you know anything about
"The Only Planet of Choice"--

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.700 align:middle line:10%
by the way, there's
three chapters in there

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:43.230 align:middle line:10%
with Gene Roddenberry
channeling Tom of the Nine--

01:14:43.230 --> 01:14:45.040 align:middle line:10%
Deep Space Nine.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.340 align:middle line:10%
Would you start
studying this stuff?

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.800 align:middle line:10%
Gene Roddenberry's
vision for "Star Trek."

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Aliens have had, or
ETs, or an intelligence

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.420 align:middle line:90%
have had a hand at all of this.

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They tried to jump-start
this movement in the '70s.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.740 align:middle line:90%
I meet Uri Geller.

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:00.780 align:middle line:90%
There I am.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.880 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.722 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I had
him invited to-- he

01:15:04.722 --> 01:15:06.180 align:middle line:84%
thinks I'm connected
with the nine,

01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.840 align:middle line:84%
but I'm connected
with everything.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.500 align:middle line:90%
So he invites me there.

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
I have, in my hand, a Wile
E. Coyote with a parachute

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.970 align:middle line:90%
that I got out of an Easter egg.

01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:16.950 align:middle line:84%
I was going to give it
to him as a present.

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.125 align:middle line:84%
He says to me, come
into the hotel,

01:15:19.125 --> 01:15:20.250 align:middle line:90%
I've got a present for you.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
He sits down.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.700 align:middle line:10%
He goes up and gets this
little Teddy bear thing.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.430 align:middle line:10%
And I hand him the Wile E.
Coyote with a parachute.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:28.960 align:middle line:10%
He sits down really hard,
and he says, oh, my god.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.210 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what's the matter?

01:15:30.210 --> 01:15:33.460 align:middle line:10%
He said, I was a parachutist
in the Six Day War.

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.430 align:middle line:10%
And there's these little clues.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:38.520 align:middle line:10%
He said, the fact that you've
got a parachute on this thing,

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.800 align:middle line:10%
here we are.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.930 align:middle line:10%
And then I travel with
him and another psychic--

01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:46.650 align:middle line:10%
of course, Uri's really funny.

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:47.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm on stage with him.

01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
He says, stay near me
because I need the energy,

01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
but I love your
friend Max Poggi, who

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:53.730 align:middle line:90%
was an Alitalia airline pilot.

01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:55.730 align:middle line:90%
So he gives me this.

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Alitalia airline
pilot is always with me.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.000 align:middle line:10%
I always have friends with me.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.670 align:middle line:10%
He gives me this thing of seeds.

01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:03.660 align:middle line:10%
And he's on the stage.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.520 align:middle line:10%
He closes his hand.

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.320 align:middle line:10%
He opens his hands.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.240 align:middle line:10%
The seeds are sprouting.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.980 align:middle line:10%
The little green things
are on the seeds.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.605 align:middle line:10%
Instead of giving it
to me, he gives it

01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:15.180 align:middle line:10%
to my friend, the Alitalia
pilot who puts it in a frame.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.780 align:middle line:84%
When Uri gets upset, he asks
my Alitalia pilot friend

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.250 align:middle line:90%
for some tickets.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
My Alitalia pilot friend said,
I can't give you tickets.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But he goes home, and
the picture of Uri Geller

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.660 align:middle line:84%
is turned the other
way on the wall

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.510 align:middle line:84%
with all the other
pictures on the wall.

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:34.470 align:middle line:10%
So there is no explanation
to this, people.

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:35.940 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:37.410 align:middle line:10%
Here he is with me.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.840 align:middle line:10%
But I dragged with
me Pascal Riolo,

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.850 align:middle line:10%
who is the world's
greatest psychic.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:44.490 align:middle line:90%
He is in Liege in Belgium.

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Very close friend of mine.

01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
I work with him a lot.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.530 align:middle line:90%
There he is with Uri.

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
was that Pascal

01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
has had me come to Belgium.

01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I do not speak French,
but he speaks Italian.

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And has had me do some
lectures in Belgium.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.310 align:middle line:10%
That's why I've been all over.

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:02.760 align:middle line:10%
And we go to see Uri in London.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.482 align:middle line:10%
And Pascal draws
that on the plane.

01:17:04.482 --> 01:17:05.690 align:middle line:10%
He says, I'm getting a flash.

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:07.110 align:middle line:10%
He calls them flash.

01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:08.070 align:middle line:10%
There's his drawing.

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:09.450 align:middle line:10%
There's where Uri is appearing.

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:12.450 align:middle line:10%
You see all the little
circles are on that hotel.

01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:17.370 align:middle line:10%
You see the big stained
glass flower on that hotel.

01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
This is a psychic that
was at the Olympia Hotel.

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm in Roswell and I do the
Michael Wolf Kruvante story,

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:27.750 align:middle line:84%
which we will cover for
you people that have

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.850 align:middle line:90%
the mystery about Michael Wolf.

01:17:29.850 --> 01:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
We will cover that in
Laughlin this year.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
The most dangerous
story I've ever done.

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:38.530 align:middle line:90%
A double agent for the CIA.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Very much like Uri Geller
did remote viewing.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:45.122 align:middle line:84%
There's now my boss, but
he was my colleague Adriana

01:17:45.122 --> 01:17:46.080 align:middle line:90%
on the right-hand side.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.200 align:middle line:10%
I went with him because
I was scared to death.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:50.260 align:middle line:10%
He was a double agent.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:53.650 align:middle line:10%
He was in the movie
"8 1/2," Michael Wolf.

01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to him over the
phone in Rome for a solid year.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
My phone bills were $1,000.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.850 align:middle line:90%
He told me, tape everything.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only journalist.

01:18:02.850 --> 01:18:04.440 align:middle line:84%
By the way, my other
journalist friends--

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to name them--

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.737 align:middle line:84%
talk to him, and they said
he knew too much, so they

01:18:07.737 --> 01:18:08.920 align:middle line:90%
didn't go to his apartment.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.590 align:middle line:10%
Or they said he was a hoax.

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:13.230 align:middle line:10%
I've been to his
apartment three times.

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:16.440 align:middle line:90%
The problem was this.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.820 align:middle line:90%
That's my apartment in Rome.

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.180 align:middle line:90%
First floor.

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
On two occasions, car bombs went
off in front of my apartment.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I was coming back
from the senior prom.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And I saw it the first time.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what the
heck is going on?

01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is only a
three-floor apartment.

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Also, my brakes were cut.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, on a second
occasion when this happened,

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I was sleeping, white
nightgown, because there

01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
was an Italian on the
other side of the apartment

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:47.610 align:middle line:90%
complex, in the other corridor.

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:49.380 align:middle line:84%
The bomb went off at
3:00 in the morning.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:49.950 align:middle line:90%
I was scared.

01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:51.992 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't get out the
door, because the door was

01:18:51.992 --> 01:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
fused from the heat.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And I had to go up to the
landlord on the second floor.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And this Italian guy
goes, finally we meet.

01:18:58.530 --> 01:18:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And I go, not like this.

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:02.160 align:middle line:10%
I've got a nightgown on.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.460 align:middle line:10%
We ran up to the second
floor, and we said, come on!

01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:07.740 align:middle line:10%
Twice in a row?

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.560 align:middle line:10%
This was the Michael Wolf
Kruvante story, 2000.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.186 align:middle line:10%
He died 2000.

01:19:12.186 --> 01:19:15.990 align:middle line:10%
18 years later, we're going to
open this up and talk about it.

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:18.820 align:middle line:10%
This is what I talked to
you about on the panel.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:19.620 align:middle line:10%
I started.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.620 align:middle line:10%
There's Ricardo Gonzalez, who
is doing a retreat in Crestone

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.600 align:middle line:10%
for only 100 people.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600 align:middle line:10%
He's had contact.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.330 align:middle line:10%
He was part of the
[INAUDIBLE] Group,

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:31.500 align:middle line:10%
the young guys that went
aboard the craft when--

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.790 align:middle line:10%
I interviewed Cecil's
brother in Canada.

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:35.790 align:middle line:10%
I drove 1,300 miles.

01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.000 align:middle line:10%
Same story.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the tree.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
That was the tree in Shasta
the guy was sitting next to.

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Hang on.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.220 align:middle line:10%
I'll go back to it.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.050 align:middle line:10%
He was standing
next to that tree.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.710 align:middle line:10%
And we were in
front of those logs.

01:19:48.710 --> 01:19:51.450 align:middle line:10%
And this is the guy.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:54.540 align:middle line:84%
This is not a Nordic
from the Pleiades.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.390 align:middle line:84%
This is an Apunian
from the planet Apu

01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:59.790 align:middle line:84%
who said he's us
from the future.

01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You've got individualize
stories, not

01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:07.530 align:middle line:84%
shove them all together
in some kind of salad

01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:09.300 align:middle line:90%
that nothing makes sense.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
This guy is not going to
act like the other Nordics

01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.460 align:middle line:90%
that everybody's talking about.

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.230 align:middle line:90%
This guy in particular--

01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't talk about
the second encounter

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.600 align:middle line:84%
I had with him, which
was a holographic image.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.730 align:middle line:10%
I was so freaked
I got no message

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.340 align:middle line:10%
until I went back, and
went to sleep in my bed,

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.630 align:middle line:10%
and every hour on the
hour, I got a message.

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.790 align:middle line:10%
And the message was,
Paola, if you will lead,

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:32.260 align:middle line:10%
we will match your efforts.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.890 align:middle line:10%
If you do nothing,
we'll do nothing.

01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:36.810 align:middle line:10%
That was the message.

01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:38.520 align:middle line:10%
The first one was
just, thank you.

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.110 align:middle line:10%
So the second one
was, if you will lead,

01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:42.360 align:middle line:10%
we will match your efforts.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.390 align:middle line:10%
Read that book.

01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.190 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:47.100 align:middle line:10%
So Jacques is amazing.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:50.230 align:middle line:10%
And you have to think
outside the box.

01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:53.070 align:middle line:10%
He said he looked at
the projector instead

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:54.090 align:middle line:10%
of the projection.

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
He used to look at
the projection booth,

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
because he's thinking
outside the box.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
This story, I went
back four times.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
It drove me crazy.

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
He has Polaroids of beings.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's one of them.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And then he tells me,
well, they predicted

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.180 align:middle line:84%
you were going to come, because
they call you The Bridge.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm letting you
in to see these Polaroids

01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.323 align:middle line:84%
only because they
predicted 10 years ago.

01:21:13.323 --> 01:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago they knew
what I was going to do?

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:18.510 align:middle line:10%
So anyway, there I am at--

01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:20.800 align:middle line:10%
I finish this up, because
I got a mental message

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.170 align:middle line:10%
to go to Devils Tower.

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I go to Devils--
oh, let me go back.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I go to Devil's--

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.100 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.900 align:middle line:10%
I go to Devils Tower.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.790 align:middle line:10%
I want to get over my fear.

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:33.680 align:middle line:10%
So there's all these--

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.770 align:middle line:10%
what do you call them?

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:35.570 align:middle line:10%
Yogi Bear?

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:37.340 align:middle line:10%
What are those guys?

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:38.980 align:middle line:10%
They're rangers.

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:39.900 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.190 align:middle line:10%
They're rangers.

01:21:41.190 --> 01:21:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And there are all these
rangers at Devils Tower.

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sitting there.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:47.760 align:middle line:10%
They're doing their spiel
about the night sky.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:49.020 align:middle line:10%
And I leave the bleachers.

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.860 align:middle line:10%
I'm with two close friends,
Julia and her husband,

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:52.950 align:middle line:10%
[INAUDIBLE].

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:53.970 align:middle line:10%
And I disappear.

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:54.990 align:middle line:10%
I walk down the things.

01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:56.657 align:middle line:10%
I said, I'm going to
get over this fear.

01:21:56.657 --> 01:21:59.490 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to walk in the forest,
and I'm not going to be scared.

01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:01.952 align:middle line:10%
And I start walking, and I'm
walking, and I'm walking.

01:22:01.952 --> 01:22:02.910 align:middle line:10%
I said, I'm not scared.

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:03.562 align:middle line:10%
I feel good.

01:22:03.562 --> 01:22:05.050 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do
the Devils Tower.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:05.850 align:middle line:10%
I feel good.

01:22:05.850 --> 01:22:07.500 align:middle line:10%
Julia knows I'm missing.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:08.550 align:middle line:10%
She knows I'm missing.

01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:10.225 align:middle line:10%
She's going, where did she go?

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.870 align:middle line:10%
Julia comes running into
the forest looking for me.

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:13.830 align:middle line:10%
She grabs my arm.

01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:middle line:10%
She says, Paola, what happened?

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:19.329 align:middle line:10%
And right at that minute, I
hear the tones [SINGS TONES FROM

01:22:19.329 --> 01:22:21.980 align:middle line:10%
"CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE
THIRD KIND"] And then I hear

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.753 align:middle line:10%
"dah-dah-dah-dah [RAPID TONES].

01:22:23.753 --> 01:22:25.950 align:middle line:10%
I said, Julia, do you hear that?

01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:29.500 align:middle line:10%
And she said, oh, somebody
must have a boombox.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.830 align:middle line:10%
There was no boombox.

01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:33.420 align:middle line:10%
That's how I started.

01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:37.170 align:middle line:10%
And that's the 360
of the research.

01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:41.880 align:middle line:10%
And whoever was there
that played the tones,

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.870 align:middle line:10%
I was in shock.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:45.203 align:middle line:10%
And even today when I see
Julia-- she lives in Boulder--

01:22:45.203 --> 01:22:46.495 align:middle line:10%
I say, did you hear that music?

01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Did you hear?

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:48.060 align:middle line:10%
Yes, I heard that music.

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.560 align:middle line:84%
She said, Paola,
I was right there.

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.410 align:middle line:84%
So there's John Mack
talking to the Dalai Lama.

01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:54.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all connected.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It is some kind
of weirdness that

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.540 align:middle line:84%
could be a spiritual
manifestation asking us

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.680 align:middle line:90%
to wake up or we are toast.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.970 align:middle line:90%
And they do it in weird ways.

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And here, I told you that this
is the "Project Blue Book."

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.640 align:middle line:90%
There's Allen.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.000 align:middle line:90%
I love that thing of Allen.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And it debuts on
Elvis's birthday.

01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going, oh, my god,
my life is too weird.

01:23:19.190 --> 01:23:21.240 align:middle line:90%
There's Elvis.

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:23.040 align:middle line:90%
God bless him.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.760 align:middle line:90%
This is the end.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.600 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
Graduation.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
know anything else.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.320 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Not to eat us, not to
kill us or do anything.

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.180 align:middle line:90%
They're shutting down missiles.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:40.020 align:middle line:84%
If they're appearing
over places to tell us,

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:43.800 align:middle line:84%
it's their subtle way of
saying, you guys are amazing.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
What's going on down here
after all these years?

01:23:46.890 --> 01:23:50.810 align:middle line:84%
You're in the same spot
you were in the 1960s.

01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:52.430 align:middle line:90%
But not everybody.

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:54.370 align:middle line:90%
Not you.

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.590 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:57.990 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.890 align:middle line:90%
