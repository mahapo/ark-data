00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, thanks
for coming out this late.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's been a
very, very long weekend.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you know that I'm
talking about the Seven

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Principles, the Hermetic Seven
Principles, tonight, and also

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.370 align:middle line:90%
the power of thought.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to really go
heavy on the power of thought.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And for some of you
who may have been--

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.483 align:middle line:84%
well, how many were here
yesterday in my talk?

00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
OK, so there's a
few that weren't.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.432 align:middle line:84%
So there's a couple of
slides that overlap,

00:00:32.432 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
just because they
really have a lot

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to do with what we're going
to be going over tonight.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So you may see a couple of
slides that actually overlap.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.233 align:middle line:90%
But it's very important.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's good to see
things two, three, four,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.720 align:middle line:90%
sometimes 10 times.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why on my
social media sites,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I repost my content
10, 15, 20 times, you know?

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Like once, if I have a real
powerful piece of content,

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll repost it sometimes
every three months

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or every four months like
I did today, actually,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.900 align:middle line:90%
on one of my pages.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.360 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let me just get into this

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and get started.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:90%
So again who am I?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.770 align:middle line:90%
My name is Billy Carson.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.762 align:middle line:84%
I'm the founder of
4bidden Knowledge.

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
know what that is,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:84%
it's an account that I
started approximately in 2010,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and really went more public
with it at the end of 2011,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
and then really started
working it hard in 2012.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.990 align:middle line:10%
Forbidden knowledge is knowledge
that's not impossible knowledge

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:10%
to acquire.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's just knowledge that
is very hard to source.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And I just came up with the
idea, based on a lot of things

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that I had known and
researched and read,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that I had the capability
of helping to paint a better

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:90%
picture for people.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
create something

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that I can put together, give
people places and sources

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.482 align:middle line:84%
to start to do their research
and acquire information or put

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:84%
together information
for them to research

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and look at that they probably
didn't know existed, even

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.500 align:middle line:84%
though most of it is
in the public domain

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or in areas that are
very hard to find.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Some is from people that may
be whistleblowers and so forth.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But the information generally
is available in most cases.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is a slide that
overlapped a little bit.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.230 align:middle line:84%
The Emerald Tablets really tie
into the Hermetic Principles.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Because Hermes is Thoth.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Thoth from ancient
Egypt is Hermes.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Thoth has many names
over the millennia.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:90%
He's been called Thoth.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:84%
He's ruled over Egypt
for 14,000 years.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
He's also been called, of
course, Hermes by the Greeks.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
He's been Mercury.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
Mercury is his planet.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.560 align:middle line:84%
He actually runs and
controls the planet Mercury.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:90%
That's his planet.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the reason
why is because he also

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
has the power over liquid
mercury, the ferrofluid.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
They found a lot of that
underneath the pyramid complex

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in Ditujukan, Mexico.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
He's also, to the
Mesoamericans, Quetzalcoatl.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:90%
He's Kukulkan.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.310 align:middle line:90%
He's Viracocha.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:90%
He's Lord Pakal.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:90%
He's many, many names.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.925 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, if
you go to Washington, DC,

00:02:57.925 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
there was somebody
who was asking

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
me earlier today, do you
think that governments

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:90%
know about this stuff?

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:90%
They know more about it than us.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
They research this
stuff intensively.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They spend billions of dollars
on researching this stuff.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.868 align:middle line:84%
And they try to
reverse-engineer anything

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:13.160 align:middle line:90%
they read in the ancient texts.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what they've been doing.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Hitler did it.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course, through
Project Paperclip,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:84%
we brought over all
the German scientists.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
There were several hundred
of them, not just a couple.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And through them,
they've been researching

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.350 align:middle line:84%
this content for decades,
maybe even longer than that.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to Washington,
DC and go to the Congressional

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Library, right on the door,
etched into two gigantic steel

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.270 align:middle line:84%
doors, what do you have
etched into the doors?

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:90%
Thoth and Odin.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:10%
Odin is also Thoth.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:90%
It's another name for Thoth.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
So on this of the
door, you have Thoth.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
On this side of the
door, you have Odin--

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:90%
both the same person--

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:84%
at the Congressional Library,
the doors to the Congressional

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Library, in Washington, DC.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
As of course, no matter
where you go on this planet,

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:84%
any major country
is always going

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.600 align:middle line:84%
to have brick masonry that
emphasizes Egyptian motif.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.783 align:middle line:10%
Why is that?

00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they hide a
lot of the mysteries

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and the calculations
in the brick masonry.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
design of the buildings

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.077 align:middle line:84%
are set in a certain way
to convey hidden messages

00:04:09.077 --> 00:04:11.660 align:middle line:84%
and information that's passed
on from generation to generation

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of brick masons, as well
as harness different types

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%
of energies and powers.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you
go to Washington, DC,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.223 align:middle line:90%
you see Egyptian motif.

00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You go to the Vatican,
you see Egyptian motif.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.442 align:middle line:84%
You go to the
kingdoms of England,

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:90%
you see Egyptian motif.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere
because the people

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
who run those organizations
are in the direct bloodline

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
of descendants of a lot of
these ancient Atlantean people

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that were on this planet a
very, very long time ago.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Emerald Tablets were
written about 36,000 years ago

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.940 align:middle line:90%
by Thoth himself.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is very
key because we're

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:84%
talking about the
principles that he laid down

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:90%
in these tablets.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
This is some of the oldest
writing on the planet

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.572 align:middle line:84%
that we know of that's a
complete writing that we

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
can actually go through,
analyze, study, and break down.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
it's so important.

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
I was doing an interview
earlier today with a radio show.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.198 align:middle line:84%
And she was asking me, well,
this Thoth, is he around?

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you think he's
going to come back?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Is he still here?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:90%
I said, he's here right now.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
He's manifesting in
all of us as fractals.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.075 align:middle line:90%
He's a fractal.

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the
third dimension

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
operates over
fractal technology,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.590 align:middle line:84%
like I talked about in
my speech yesterday.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.080 align:middle line:84%
We live in a fractal
holographic universe.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Fractals are not just
material objects.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.375 align:middle line:84%
Fractals can be
economic systems.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.750 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
economic systems,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.875 align:middle line:90%
we see how they fractalize.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
When we look at thought
and consciousness,

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:90%
we see how it fractalizes.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about
being a fractal of Thoth,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
a fractal of Thoth's
consciousness

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and all his teachings have now
entered into me, and because

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.213 align:middle line:84%
of me, have entered into
now thousands of people.

00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you study and learn
it, it enters into more people.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:90%
And it just keeps on going.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a progression
through consciousness.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And in that way,
and in that means,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.950 align:middle line:84%
people have the capability
of living forever

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.100 align:middle line:84%
through transmitting thoughts
through consciousness

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.800 align:middle line:84%
that then gets handed down
from person to person.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.655 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
verbal type of a history.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
he really knew

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that this was a day and age that
the mysteries of these Emerald

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Tablets would be
revealed to mankind

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:90%
at this particular time.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
this information has

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
been so ambiguous and so hard
to decipher and understand.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric message has
been so hard to figure out

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:90%
for so many eons.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, now
it's all coming to light.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Why are we just now beginning
to understand this information?

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.158 align:middle line:84%
Why are we beginning
now, just now,

00:06:25.158 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
to really be able to break
it down and digest it?

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.283 align:middle line:90%
Because the time is right.

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness has
reached a specific level.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that
this information

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:84%
would arrive here
and be open to us

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to receive at this
particular point in time.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the things that he
talks about in the Emerald

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Tablets are coming to fruition.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
A hidden chamber above
the Grand Gallery

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
inside the Great Pyramid-- well,
36,000 years ago he said it.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:90%
Now, guess what?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We found it at the
beginning of 2018.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Through a muon scan, we
found the hidden chamber

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.250 align:middle line:84%
above the Grand Gallery
in the Great Pyramid.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The Halls of Amenti
underneath the Great Pyramid,

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:84%
where he would go down and
use the regeneration chambers,

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.930 align:middle line:84%
they found that
last year as well--

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of chambers
about a mile

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
deep underneath the
Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.200 align:middle line:90%
exactly where he said they were.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
So as we go into this
text, and we dig into it,

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.095 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize,
wow, there are really

00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of correlations and
lot of information that's

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:90%
finally being revealed to us.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So let me give a little
bit of credibility

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.553 align:middle line:90%
to the Emerald Tablets.

00:07:21.553 --> 00:07:22.970 align:middle line:84%
The history of the
Emerald Tablets

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.890 align:middle line:84%
is very strong and
well-documented.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.578 align:middle line:84%
The original text was written
in Thoth's Atlantean language.

00:07:27.578 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
The version that I will be
referencing in this workshop

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
was translated by
Dr. Michael Doreal

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and can be found on
Crystal Links dot com.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
A new translation
has recently been

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.027 align:middle line:84%
published from the Arabic
version of the Emerald Tablets.

00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And it is called
"The Book of Causes,"

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
written by the famous
Thomas Aquinas.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So some of you may know
that's a very famous cardinal.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:84%
A translation by
Sir Isaac Newton

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
was found among his alchemical
papers, that are currently

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.445 align:middle line:84%
housed in King's College
Library at Cambridge University.

00:07:56.445 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, I don't
know if these things are real

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:84%
or it ever existed, well, Sir
Isaac Newton has a copy of them

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:90%
that he translated.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.958 align:middle line:90%
And they're still on display.

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.480 align:middle line:84%
You can go to
Cambridge right now

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and look at them
with your own eyes.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Philip of Tripoli
also translated

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
the Emerald Tablets in 1240 AD.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And he also wrote
a famous version

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.162 align:middle line:84%
called "The Book of
the Secret of Creation

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:17.120 align:middle line:90%
and the Art of Nature."

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And so basically,
Thoth's Emerald Tablets

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.920 align:middle line:84%
inspired him to
write those books.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And a famous author
named Roger Bacon

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
was accepted into Oxford
University at the age of 13.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He also translated and wrote a
version of the Emerald Tablets.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was an English
philosopher, Franciscan Friar,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:84%
who placed considerable
emphasis on the study of nature

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.720 align:middle line:90%
through empirical methods.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.210 align:middle line:84%
In the early modern era,
he was regarded as a wizard

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and particularly
famed for the story

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
of his mechanical
necrochromatic brazen head.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.590 align:middle line:84%
He was building
robots back then.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
He's sometimes credited
as one of the earliest

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.580 align:middle line:84%
European advocates of the
modern scientific method

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and was inspired by Aristotle
and other later scholars,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
such as the Arab
scientist al-Haytham.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about a very
powerful, very studious man,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.090 align:middle line:84%
who also broke down,
analyzed, and translated

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:90%
these Emerald Tablets.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
well-documented.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So, taking away the ambiguity
of the tablets, were they real?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Did they ever exist?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:90%
And so forth and so on.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:84%
As you can see from this
information, hundreds of years

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
ago, the tablets were
passing from hand to hand,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.050 align:middle line:90%
being translated.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.202 align:middle line:84%
And translations of them
are still available today.

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:21.660 align:middle line:84%
There's even more
people than that.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:90%
The Queen of Sheba--

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I could just
keep going on and on.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Very, very famous kings and
queens and very powerful people

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.750 align:middle line:84%
have had their hands on
this-- very well-documented.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Right now, where are
the original tablets?

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the Vatican
in that five-mile archive

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
they have underneath
that Vatican City.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the original ones.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
But all the other ones that
have been copied and translated

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.980 align:middle line:90%
are still available to us.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say, OK,
well, how did these Hermetic

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Principles even get to
us, and everything else?

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand,
in the Emerald Tablets,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:84%
when you read them-- and I wrote
a book called "A Compendium

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.230 align:middle line:90%
of the Emerald Tablets."

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.898 align:middle line:90%
Some of you here have the book.

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
In the "Compendium of
the Emerald Tablets,"

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I really do a very
good job, I think,

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.460 align:middle line:84%
of breaking down all of
the esoteric information

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and what looks to be what we
would call religious scriptures

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:90%
or biblical-type scriptures.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.343 align:middle line:84%
Because all the
modern-day religions,

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that's where they got
their information.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.927 align:middle line:84%
They literally copied a
lot of the information

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:17.512 align:middle line:84%
from the emerald tablets
and Sumerian tablets--

00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:19.720 align:middle line:84%
even some from the Mahabharata
and the Bhagavad Gita,

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.520 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So all of these texts
that predate the Bible

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
by tens of thousands of years,
basically, they just copied.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
They copied small
bits and pieces,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.640 align:middle line:84%
put it into their own
formats, and created

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:90%
their religious framework.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.197 align:middle line:84%
But the information
is coming from there.

00:10:36.197 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
in my book, "Compendium

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.090 align:middle line:84%
of the Emerald Tablets,"
I break down specifically

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
where in the New
Testament of the Bible,

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:90%
where Jesus is speaking.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And I break down where Thoth is
speaking in the Emerald Tablets

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.800 align:middle line:90%
36,000 years ago.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Bible is
written 100 AD to 900 AD.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:90%
This is a current, new book.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:90%
This is new information.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Nobody in the Bible wrote
any part of the Bible.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.775 align:middle line:84%
All of the people
that talk, that

00:11:01.775 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
supposedly have their
own books in the Bible,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.608 align:middle line:90%
didn't write any of it.

00:11:04.608 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
They all were long-gone
and dead many, many years.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody in the
future, followers of Thoth,

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
followers of Hermes,
are the people

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.450 align:middle line:84%
that actually wrote
the Bible, based off

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
of information they acquired
from the Sumerian tablets

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.520 align:middle line:90%
and the Emerald Tablets.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:84%
In the Emerald Tablets,
when Thoth is speaking,

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.543 align:middle line:84%
he's saying the same exact
words that Jesus is speaking--

00:11:24.543 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
or, Yeshua, actually,
is his real name--

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
is speaking in
the New Testament.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
Which came first, the
chicken or the egg?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a book
that I have called

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:90%
"The Holy Gospel of 12"--

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
very expensive scriptures
that are very rare.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it cost me $659
for the scriptures.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:90%
I bought them on Amazon.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.022 align:middle line:84%
If you can find a copy, get
them and hold onto them.

00:11:47.022 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:90%
They're worth a lot of money.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Say that again?

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> "The Holy Gospel of 12"--

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.572 align:middle line:84%
"Holy Gospel of 12," a very
rare scripture-- real scripture.

00:11:55.572 --> 00:11:57.530 align:middle line:10%
The reason why it's so
powerful, and the reason

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:10%
why they're so rare, they've
been out of publication

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:10%
for a while.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to let you
export them or import them out

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:90%
of different countries.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:84%
They talk about where Jesus
was from the age of 14 to 33,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
when he disappeared out
of the modern-day Bible.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.452 align:middle line:90%
Where did he go?

00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Well, he went to Egypt.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And I've been in his house in
Egypt, where he actually lived.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a shrine.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
They've got his name etched
into the wall, there.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.110 align:middle line:84%
The bed and everything
is still there.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And evidence of this is also
in the modern-day Bible,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
where it says I had to
call my son out of Egypt.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.962 align:middle line:84%
God is supposedly saying--
it was actually really Enki--

00:12:28.962 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:84%
saying he's going to call
his son out of Egypt.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
But he went to Egypt to
learn the Egyptian mysteries.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.980 align:middle line:84%
He went to mystery
school in Egypt.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
Who was the most
fundamental teacher

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:90%
of the Egyptian mysteries?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:90%
Thoth.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Thoth started the
Egyptian mysteries.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Then from there, he
left and went to India

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:90%
to learn Reiki healing.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And then he left
from there and went

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to Tibet to learn the
mystic arts and all the way

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
back, teaching
reincarnation as he went.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
The whole fundamental
basis of the Bible--

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
even though it's been
chopped and screwed and kind

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:58.603 align:middle line:90%
of dislocated--

00:12:58.603 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
basis of the Bible

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is all about teaching
reincarnation

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and the power of using
your mind and consciousness

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.732 align:middle line:84%
to consciously
reincarnate at will.

00:13:07.732 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's really, really
what's it's all about.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:14.030 align:middle line:10%
If you go and look at
the Sinai Bible, which

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:10%
has 14,800 differences from
the modern-day King James

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:10%
version of the Bible, you
discover that Jesus was never

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:10%
even crucified.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
If you go into
Harvard Library, you

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
can find the book of Jesus'
wife, where he actually

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.325 align:middle line:84%
got married to Mary Magdalene
and most likely had kids.

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And probably, the
Merovingian bloodline

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:84%
is still on this planet
until this very day.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.822 align:middle line:84%
So the deeper you
start researching--

00:13:34.822 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
go into the Aramaic,
and you start seeing

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.095 align:middle line:90%
all these mistranslated words.

00:13:38.095 --> 00:13:40.220 align:middle line:84%
You start to realize that
the word God in the Bible

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is actually "gods," plural, not
"god," singular, because it's

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.760 align:middle line:84%
talking about these
Anunnaki people,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
these Atlanteans that
were here, masquerading

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.030 align:middle line:84%
as gods in different
regions of the planet.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were battling
and fighting each other.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.010 align:middle line:84%
If you look in the book of
Deuteronomy in the modern-day

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
Bible--

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
which most people can't
give you any information

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
about the book of Deuteronomy
because it's never

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.708 align:middle line:90%
talked about in church.

00:14:00.708 --> 00:14:02.333 align:middle line:84%
It's never talked
about in Bible study.

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't want
you to know what's

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.975 align:middle line:90%
in that book of Deuteronomy.

00:14:04.975 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
You read the book
of Deuteronomy,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.970 align:middle line:84%
you have a big,
eye-opening experience

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
because all of a
sudden, you discover

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.883 align:middle line:84%
it's not the creator of
the universe talking, here.

00:14:11.883 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:84%
The creator of the universe
doesn't have time to sit there

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:90%
and say it's OK to rape women.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.312 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to kill children.

00:14:18.312 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go to this
town that you've never

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.965 align:middle line:84%
been to that you don't
even know exists,

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to go there, and
I want you to destroy the city,

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.132 align:middle line:84%
kill the people,
women, and children,

00:14:26.132 --> 00:14:28.767 align:middle line:84%
take the spoils of war,
bring everything back to me.

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:31.100 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't sound like a
creator of the universe to me.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:90%
That's somebody else.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
a lot of things

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.820 align:middle line:90%
started getting misplaced.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.740 align:middle line:84%
It was more designed
for control factors.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.980 align:middle line:84%
There were people that
were masquerading as gods.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are some of
these Atlantean people

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:48.320 align:middle line:84%
that interacted and engaged
mankind in the distant past,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:90%
put together these systems.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They even put together
a political system.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.970 align:middle line:84%
They put together
the financial system.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
All this inflation in
this capitalistic society

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.197 align:middle line:84%
didn't start now,
in modern times.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:14:59.780 align:middle line:84%
If you go back into
Sumerian tablets--

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:84%
there's been over a million
tablets dug up in Iraq.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.720 align:middle line:84%
These tablets are mostly not
about Anunnakis and aliens.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.010 align:middle line:90%
They're receipts and IOUs.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So you go back, you
discover they started

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:84%
this system of money,
where if you had 10 sheep,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and I had a vineyard of
apples, I would come to you.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And then I would trade you
some apples for the sheep.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.690 align:middle line:84%
But if I didn't have time
to harvest the apples,

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:84%
or I was sold out of
my apples already--

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
I had already bartered
them with somebody else--

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:90%
I can come to you.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And you would give me
an IOU in cuneiform text

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:90%
on a little, tiny tablet.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
There's millions of them.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And then what would happen is I
can come back at a later time.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.933 align:middle line:90%
And then I can get these apples.

00:15:39.933 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But when you come to get
the apples, all of a sudden,

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
I still don't have all
the apples available.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the value of the
little tablet has gone up.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.270 align:middle line:90%
This is inflation, now.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This starts from a long,
long time ago, folks.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.917 align:middle line:90%
All of this bicameral Congress--

00:15:54.917 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
all that was put into
place a very long time

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.217 align:middle line:90%
ago by these Anunnaki people.

00:15:58.217 --> 00:15:59.550 align:middle line:90%
These people were very advanced.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
And when a lesser
advanced society

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
meets a highly advanced
society, we look upon them

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
as they were gods.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.562 align:middle line:84%
Right now, if a
alien ship landed,

00:16:06.562 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
there are still going to be
people on this planet right now

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
today that are going
to worship these people

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
and believing that that's
the Savior coming back.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.080 align:middle line:84%
That's just the way
we've been programmed.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been programmed so long
like this, this is what we do.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We don't realize that there's
other people out there.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And Earth is fairly new.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.032 align:middle line:90%
We're the new kids on the block.

00:16:25.032 --> 00:16:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We have cousins out there
that have been around

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.310 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
These Anunnaki people arrived on
this planet 450,000 years ago,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.530 align:middle line:84%
according to the Enuma Elish and
the Seven Tablets of Creation.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
realize that they

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:39.650 align:middle line:84%
could be from
region to space that

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.540 align:middle line:84%
could have been in existence
and had developed 2, 3,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.080 align:middle line:90%
4 billion years ahead of us.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So once you chop up the
13.5 billion-year history

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:84%
of the universe,
and you put it out

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
in epochs, four or
five epochs, you

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
realize that we're kind of
on the end-side of the epoch.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been other epochs.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, other
sectors of space

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:03.020 align:middle line:84%
were developing planets and so
forth with people and humanoids

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.770 align:middle line:84%
living on them and expanding and
developing trillions of years--

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm sorry, billions of
years before it got to us.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:84%
So we are the new
kids on the block.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.670 align:middle line:90%
And these people realized that.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:90%
And they took advantage of it.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are some,
like Thoth, who realized

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.069 align:middle line:90%
what was being done was wrong.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:21.944 align:middle line:84%
He really, truly felt like, OK,
I'm here to teach these people.

00:17:21.944 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
I'm here to raise them to a
higher level of consciousness

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and higher level
of civilization.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.000 align:middle line:90%
His dad Enki was the good guy.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.620 align:middle line:84%
His brother Enlil
was the bad guy.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.377 align:middle line:84%
But his dad Enki wanted him
to go on the same mission.

00:17:33.377 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:90%
His dad Enki loved humans.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
He actually even
married a human wife

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.765 align:middle line:84%
and felt like we
deserved better.

00:17:38.765 --> 00:17:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And matter of fact, when
Enki was genetically

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
modifying the existing
hominid on this planet,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.900 align:middle line:90%
he put a little extra in there.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is what enraged
his brother Enlil.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Enlil is also known as
Satan, the Lord of Eden.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:84%
So that may sound a
little familiar to you.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
The ancient civilizations
called him Satan.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So Enlil is the
bad one, or the one

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
that we know as
Satan or the devil.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.050 align:middle line:84%
And Enki actually
is the good one.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But what happened was
Enlil, because he wanted

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the humans to stop praising Enki
so much and being his friend,

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:13.730 align:middle line:84%
especially after he
married a human wife,

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:15.100 align:middle line:84%
he then said his brother
was the evil one.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.190 align:middle line:90%
You're only to worship me.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only god.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
There is no other god but me--

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
which actually made its way
into the modern-day Bible,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.228 align:middle line:90%
that statement as well.

00:18:22.228 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Even the Lord's Prayer
was written by Enki.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.252 align:middle line:90%
It's called the pater noster.

00:18:26.252 --> 00:18:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, "Our Father,
who art in heaven,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:90%
hallowed be thy name.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done on Earth,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:90%
as it is in heaven.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.855 align:middle line:84%
Give us this day
our daily bread.

00:18:31.855 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:84%
As you forgive our debts,
we forgive our debtors,"

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
That came from the pater
noster, written by Enki,

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
from the land of Khem, long
before Egypt even existed.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, that made its
way into the modern--

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
so all this stuff that's
in the modern-day Bible

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and these teachings came
from these ancient texts.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's how powerful
these texts are.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to give you that.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.485 align:middle line:84%
The Anunnaki engaged
mankind in the distant past.

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason for a lot of
the religious systems

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:84%
and everything we have
today are because of them.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately
for us, Thoth left

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.160 align:middle line:84%
behind some valuable
information.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:90%
He also built the Great Pyramid.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you read the Emerald
Tablets, the very first part

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.460 align:middle line:84%
of the tablets, he's talking
about in the first verse,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.080 align:middle line:90%
"I builded the Great Pyramid."

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is important
because we're

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.510 align:middle line:84%
talking about now the
person who's saying,

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm the architect.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.180 align:middle line:84%
When he says this statement,
it's very powerful because it's

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.898 align:middle line:90%
not just "I built a pyramid."

00:19:23.898 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:90%
He's saying, I'm the architect.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
That's really what he's saying.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.177 align:middle line:84%
He "builded the Great
Pyramid, patterned

00:19:28.177 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:84%
after the pyramids
of Earth's force,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.257 align:middle line:84%
burning eternally
so that it, too,

00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%
might remain through the ages."

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So he built something
that was going to be here

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.440 align:middle line:90%
As you can see, it has been.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at the
history of the Great Pyramid,

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.773 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize that
it's far older than what

00:19:40.773 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:90%
they're saying.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is not 5,000,
6,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.020 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid is extremely,
extremely old, probably

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.180 align:middle line:84%
even more than 40,000
or 50,000 years old.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Thoth ruled over Egypt
for 14,000 years himself.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.457 align:middle line:84%
And that goes back
around 58,000 years ago.

00:20:01.457 --> 00:20:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's documented in
the Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about some
very, very old technology,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.058 align:middle line:84%
very, very, very
old architecture.

00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And he took this
architecture and spread it

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And what's very interesting is
to correlate the power of how

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.218 align:middle line:84%
true these tablets are to
tying into modern-day geology

00:20:21.218 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and saying, look, it's
all coming together,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
starting to sink.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I have a little video that
we're going to play next

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.100 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's very
important to understand that we

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.283 align:middle line:84%
build the credibility
of the Emerald Tablets,

00:20:31.283 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
so that you understand these
Hermetic Principles are

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
something that were put in place
tens of thousands of years ago,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.070 align:middle line:84%
so we can be able to
access them from now.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.905 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is John Henry.

00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he
passed away recently.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.060 align:middle line:84%
I wish I could have had a
chance to meet him face to face.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.935 align:middle line:90%
I never got a chance.

00:20:45.935 --> 00:20:48.307 align:middle line:84%
I met his partner,
Robert Schoch.

00:20:48.307 --> 00:20:50.140 align:middle line:84%
But he did something
that's very incredible.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to play
this in a second.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.640 align:middle line:84%
As I was researching
the Emerald Tablets

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and researching the Sphinx and
discovering that Enki had told

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Thoth to build the
Sphinx and point it

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
towards the lion, which is
the constellation of Leo,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.450 align:middle line:90%
and put his face on it.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So the face on the Sphinx
was not originally a lion.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:84%
In my personal opinion,
it was Thoth's face.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.630 align:middle line:90%
It was bigger.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
What happened was later on,
his jealous brother, Marduk,

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.260 align:middle line:84%
also known as Amun Ra,
recarved the Sphinx face,

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:18.727 align:middle line:84%
took Thoth's face-- they
were fighting all the time.

00:21:18.727 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And Thoth left and
went to Mesoamerica

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:90%
to start another civilization.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
But he recarved the
head to his son's head.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So the face that's
on the Sphinx now

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:90%
is actually the son of Amun Ra.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
been recarved and shrunk

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
down smaller.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe it originally
was an actual real lion.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It always had the
face of a man on it,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.840 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Sumerian tablets.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:90%
So it gives you an idea.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.132 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things I
realized when I was researching

00:21:41.132 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
was that I came to a
conclusion that the Sphinx was

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.710 align:middle line:84%
around the same age as
the Emerald Tablets,

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.628 align:middle line:84%
just because of the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you go back through
the precession-- in other words,

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the movement of the
stars across the sky--

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
and you go back to
the first Ice Age,

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
you realize not a good time to
build this megalithic structure

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:00.057 align:middle line:90%
during the Ice Age.

00:22:00.057 --> 00:22:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So then you go, OK, if
that was in alignment

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.170 align:middle line:84%
with the Sphinx at
that time, how can we

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:90%
go back again to another era?

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So you go back
another 13,000 years.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And you realize not a good
time again because of a lot

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
of catastrophes that were
happening geologically

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
on the planet--

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.970 align:middle line:90%
well-proven.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:10%
So when you go two
precessional periods back,

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:10%
you end up at 36,000 years.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.905 align:middle line:10%
And I found this video,
in which Robert Schoch was

00:22:22.905 --> 00:22:24.155 align:middle line:10%
coming to the same conclusion.

00:22:24.155 --> 00:22:25.470 align:middle line:10%
I mean, not Robert Schoch--

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Henry was coming to
the same conclusion.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:10%
Let me see if I can
get this to play, here.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.548 align:middle line:90%
Hold on.

00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
All right, so I'm just
going to continue on

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.662 align:middle line:90%
because we can't do that.

00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, what he's
talking about here,

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:84%
is he's talking about the
fact that the pyramids--

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
the Sphinx, I'm sorry-- was
about to precessional periods

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.140 align:middle line:84%
back from what it
originally was thought.

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you align the Sphinx
with the constellation of Leo

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.097 align:middle line:84%
and you go back two precessional
periods, all of a sudden,

00:22:49.097 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:90%
where do you end up?

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:84%
You end up directly
at 36,000 years ago.

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.470 align:middle line:84%
So this was a big,
eye-opening moment for me.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.270 align:middle line:90%
You got it?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:90%

It's only three minutes.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There is, at
least in principle,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.660 align:middle line:84%
a method of trying to
settle this dating question.

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But my own view is that
it's this older date,

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:84%
partly because the
Egyptians themselves

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
say that's when their
civilization began, and then

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
partly because of, I think,
the very plausible suggestion

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Sphinx is meant as
a marker of the age of Leo.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, this is another
hotbed of controversy.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of reason
to think that the ancients--

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:84%
very, very ancients-- knew about
the precession of the equinoxes

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.602 align:middle line:90%
and the shifts of ages.

00:23:40.602 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:90%
You know how that goes.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.268 align:middle line:84%
We're now at the end
of the age of Pisces

00:23:43.268 --> 00:23:45.225 align:middle line:84%
and coming into the
Age of Aquarius.

00:23:45.225 --> 00:23:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And there's plenty
of good reason

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to think that this
knowledge of precession

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.430 align:middle line:84%
goes back into deep,
deep antiquity.

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So the Sphinx is actually
intended as a Leo marker.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.950 align:middle line:84%
It only gives you
a couple of choices

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:84%
because the last age of Leo
is around 10,000, 10,500 BC.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the date chosen
by Bauval and Hancock

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.630 align:middle line:84%
for dating the Sphinx because
everything else aligns.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And then if you add to that the
probability that the Sphinx is

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.680 align:middle line:84%
looking at its own
image in the sky

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.150 align:middle line:84%
when it rises against
the sun at the equinox,

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
you've again got
this 10,500 date.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem with that date,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.300 align:middle line:84%
is that in
paleoclimatology, you know--

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.850 align:middle line:90%
and nobody disagrees with this--

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that the whole Earth is
in chaos at that time,

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
following the breakup
of the Ice Age,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
which happens around
12,000 BC for reasons

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.620 align:middle line:90%
no one is quite sure.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.037 align:middle line:84%
Schoch's written
a very good book,

00:24:40.037 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:90%
called "Voices of the Rocks."

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of a
state-of-the-art statement

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.333 align:middle line:90%
on catastrophe theory.

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So everybody knows that
this catastrophe took place.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.623 align:middle line:90%
No one's sure why.

00:24:48.623 --> 00:24:50.290 align:middle line:84%
That's when all the
woolly mammoths died

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:51.618 align:middle line:90%
and the woolly rhinoceroses.

00:24:51.618 --> 00:24:53.035 align:middle line:84%
You know, all the
mass extinctions

00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
that are called the
Quaternary extinctions--

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.370 align:middle line:90%
all this took place.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So in my way of
thinking, building

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.220 align:middle line:84%
all of this incredible
stuff requires

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.210 align:middle line:84%
a long-settled and
stable civilization.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't just build
things like this

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.315 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of a worldwide,
global, chaotic situation,

00:25:13.315 --> 00:25:15.940 align:middle line:84%
where there are earthquakes all
over the place and huge floods.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.995 align:middle line:90%
And everything's unstuck.

00:25:17.995 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.840 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless,
the star alignments

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:90%
work for that 10,500 date.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But because of these
various mitigating factors,

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that date.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And the only other
choice is to push

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
it back another full
precessional cycle, which

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.030 align:middle line:90%
is effectively 26,000 years.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
That gives you 36,000
BC, which corresponds

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
to the Egyptian
texts themselves.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So even though it
looks outrageous,

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
particularly to an academic,
to me, it's the more plausible

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.400 align:middle line:90%
of the possible scenarios.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And it just remains to be seen
if we're able to actually date

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.230 align:middle line:90%
this thing.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The dating will probably
remain conjecture,

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.530 align:middle line:84%
until or unless we're able to
put a date to it or other fine

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
somehow or another, if we get
permission to come back here

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.770 align:middle line:84%
with seismographs and
radar and stuff like that

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and are again able to find
other artifacts underground.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to date
those by stratification

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.690 align:middle line:84%
or by finding something that
maybe can be carbon-dated.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.388 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
various possibilities.

00:26:28.388 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of possibilities
for getting to a date,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.070 align:middle line:84%
a lot of it really
depending upon at least

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.843 align:middle line:84%
a few within the academic
establishment saying yeah,

00:26:38.843 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:84%
this stuff really has
to be looked into.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.510 align:middle line:84%
They're never going to
say, yeah, we were wrong,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%
and you were right.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
But all I need is
enough of a concession

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.330 align:middle line:90%
that says this is interesting.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's put some time and effort
into trying to get behind it.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll see what happens.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The Age of Leo marks the
beginning point of the vast

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:59.860 align:middle line:84%
celestial cycles known as the
precession of the equinoxes.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx, as
the marker of Leo,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.370 align:middle line:84%
demonstrates a knowledge of
complex celestial mechanics

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.525 align:middle line:84%
and the observation of phenomena
spanning tens of thousands

00:27:09.525 --> 00:27:10.325 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:12.855 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.855 --> 00:27:13.730 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So like I said, I like to
add other sources, sometimes,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.520 align:middle line:84%
in my presentations from
people that are also reputable.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.530 align:middle line:84%
That way, it's not
just me up here,

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.535 align:middle line:84%
giving you what some people
may think is just my guesswork.

00:27:27.535 --> 00:27:29.410 align:middle line:10%
Sphinxes have been found
all over the world--

00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:10%
Greece, Egypt, India,
Assyria, China.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.680 align:middle line:10%
I mean, no matter where
you go, there are sphinxes

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:10%
all over this planet.

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.960 align:middle line:10%
And there's one that's famous
in Romania called the Bucegi

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.030 align:middle line:10%
Mountains Sphinx.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
I've done a 2 and
1/2 hour documentary.

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:48.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a 2 and 1/2 hour
documentary about the Bucegi

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.568 align:middle line:84%
Mountains and the sphinx
that's located there

00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:90%
and some hidden chambers there.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever get a
chance to go on YouTube,

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.540 align:middle line:84%
look up the Bucegi Mountain
documentary that we did.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.152 align:middle line:90%
It's myself and several others.

00:28:00.152 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of amazing
things going on there.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:04.027 align:middle line:10%
We used a Prometheus
head because they kind of

00:28:04.027 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:10%
copied the Bucegi
Sphinx for that movie.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:10%
But there's an amazing chamber
inside the Bucegi Mountains

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:10%
that only a specific
genetic makeup of person

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.020 align:middle line:10%
can walk through
the force field.

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
well-documented.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
So again, this is
more information

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.857 align:middle line:84%
that's publicly available,
but really suppressed.

00:28:23.857 --> 00:28:25.190 align:middle line:90%
But the information's out there.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever have a chance to
check out the Bucegi Mountains

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Sphinx and the Bucegi Mountains
documentary, look it up.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.810 align:middle line:90%
It's free on YouTube.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
When you look around the world
along the 33rd-degree parallel,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.280 align:middle line:84%
you find that these ancient
Atlantean Anunnaki beings

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
had built megalithic
structures along the line

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:90%
of this parallel.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.290 align:middle line:10%
And one of the biggest
things you notice

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:10%
are the pyramids in Mexico,
Egypt, and also in Cambodia--

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:10%
three of all the places I've
been, actually, in 2018.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, Egypt, I was there
the last time in 2014.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.157 align:middle line:84%
In 2018, I was in Mexico
and also in Cambodia.

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So I've witnessed these
places, all three of them,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.290 align:middle line:90%
with my own eyes.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Their construction
technique is similar

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and shows that it's the
same exact architect.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.943 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis was not
a ringed city that

00:29:14.943 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:84%
was just sitting in the
middle of the Atlantic Ocean

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and in one day sunk
or disappeared.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:10%
Atlantis was a global
civilization-- global.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.630 align:middle line:10%
And in the opening verses
of the Emerald Tablets,

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.180 align:middle line:10%
Thoth is told by his
dad to go and take

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:10%
his crew into the great ship
and go out to the land of Khem

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.008 align:middle line:10%
and basically help raise them to
a higher level of civilization.

00:29:35.008 --> 00:29:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And what he does, he gets
into this ship with his crew.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:38.987 align:middle line:84%
And they rise up into
the morning sun--

00:29:38.987 --> 00:29:39.820 align:middle line:90%
they don't sail out.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.580 align:middle line:84%
They rise up "until
the Earth disappears"--

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.380 align:middle line:90%
these are the exact words.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And then they travel
to the place appointed.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.605 align:middle line:90%
And then they begin to descend.

00:29:48.605 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:84%
After they notice they've
found one of the great temples,

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.920 align:middle line:84%
they begin to descend
on the land of Khem.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming
down from the sky,

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.430 align:middle line:90%
descending back to the Earth.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And as he's coming down,
he sees beneath him

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:84%
the hairy barbarians--
people that

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.970 align:middle line:84%
came out of caves that had
survived the last great flood.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Because in the opening
of the Emerald Tablets,

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
36,000 years ago, there
was a great flood.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And the waters had
just started to recede.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This is why they had to go back
and re-kickstart civilization

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.520 align:middle line:84%
These people had been here
for a very, very long time.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.937 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things that happens

00:30:17.937 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is as soon as he lands the
ship, he opens the door.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The barbarians come to attack
with cudgels and spears.

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Thoth raises his staff and
sends out a ray of vibration

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.353 align:middle line:84%
and stops them still as
the stone of the mountain.

00:30:28.353 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So he basically has a way to
use a stun gun 36,000 years ago

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.487 align:middle line:84%
to freeze these
people from attacking.

00:30:33.487 --> 00:30:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Then he releases them
and begins to show him

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.140 align:middle line:84%
his magic science, which
means advanced technology.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:10%
And they started
groveling at his feet.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.015 align:middle line:84%
Because right away, they
thought he was a god.

00:30:43.015 --> 00:30:44.140 align:middle line:90%
But then what did Thoth do?

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.002 align:middle line:90%
He didn't masquerade.

00:30:46.002 --> 00:30:46.960 align:middle line:90%
He said, you know what?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Stand up.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Get up.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:90%
We're sons of Atlantis.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're here to teach you
and bring you to a higher

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:90%
level of civilization.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So again, you see the
mindset of this being is

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:90%
not to dominate and control.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a mindset of
service to others.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is why he
became so powerful.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.250 align:middle line:84%
The reason why he became one
of the most powerful beings--

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
that we know of right
now as human beings,

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.495 align:middle line:84%
that we know of, that
we can read and study--

00:31:10.495 --> 00:31:14.320 align:middle line:84%
in the universe is because
of his service to others.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It gave him the ability to
transcend multiple dimensions

00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.240 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.430 align:middle line:84%
He had ascended to
such a high level

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:84%
that he was able to
travel to other planets

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
with his mind and witness
civilizations rise and fall,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:90%
according to him.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:90%
That takes a very long time.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.530 align:middle line:84%
He also had the capability of
transferring his consciousness

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:33.370 align:middle line:90%
into other bodies.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.560 align:middle line:90%
So he would get avatar bodies--

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
humanoid-- transfer his
consciousness into them,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.955 align:middle line:84%
and then walk amongst
men and teaching men,

00:31:41.955 --> 00:31:44.080 align:middle line:84%
while the other body would
go into the regeneration

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.663 align:middle line:84%
chamber underneath
the Halls of Amenti

00:31:45.663 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
underneath the Great
Pyramid and sit there

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.580 align:middle line:90%
for 100 years at a time.

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And he did this 100 times 100.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
That's 100,000 years
that we're talking

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.050 align:middle line:84%
about transferring consciousness
back and forth between bodies

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.820 align:middle line:90%
and walking amongst men.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.102 align:middle line:84%
So this just gives you
an idea of the power

00:32:00.102 --> 00:32:01.060 align:middle line:90%
that these people have.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And if it sounds crazy,
we're currently doing it now.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what I talked
about yesterday

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.410 align:middle line:84%
in the holographic universe
lecture that I did--

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:84%
the fact that we,
right now, have already

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.940 align:middle line:84%
transferred the consciousness
of an animal, of a monkey,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.252 align:middle line:90%
into a computer.

00:32:14.252 --> 00:32:15.710 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that we're doing.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.860 align:middle line:84%
We also have the avatar
project through DARPA,

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:84%
where we transferred the
consciousness of a soldier

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to a field robot, just
like in the movie "Avatar,"

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:84%
so that the soldier can now
operate a field robot in war,

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:84%
in war games, without
worrying about getting

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.390 align:middle line:90%
killed or injured.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And now the 2045
project out of Russia,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.690 align:middle line:84%
they're now working on
transferring consciousness

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.243 align:middle line:90%
of a human being into robots.

00:32:39.243 --> 00:32:40.660 align:middle line:84%
But that was already
done by 2010.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:41.820 align:middle line:84%
But now, they're
working on sending it

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:43.160 align:middle line:90%
into a biological organism.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically using
stem cells to clone new bodies

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and transfer the
consciousness of a person

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.680 align:middle line:90%
into those new bodies.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is something
available for the super-elites

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.590 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of money.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So people like Rothschild
and Rockefeller

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
and those kind of people,
when they pass on,

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.420 align:middle line:84%
don't be surprised if
they really aren't dead.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:90%
They could be in another body.

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:05.950 align:middle line:10%
And that's not even
science-fiction anymore.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:10%
Notice the triptych design
that has been passed on

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:10.943 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of the features
and functionality that

00:33:10.943 --> 00:33:12.610 align:middle line:10%
have been passed on
from these pyramids.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:15.252 align:middle line:10%
You see this triptych design,
these three-window designs

00:33:15.252 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:10%
or these three-opening
designs at the top

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:10%
of these three different
pyramids that I've been to.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
Catholic churches,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.970 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that they've
also assumed and copied

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.380 align:middle line:90%
this same triptych design--

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.750 align:middle line:84%
the three-window design, the
stained-glass three-window

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:90%
design.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.288 align:middle line:84%
When you pass by a big
church, a big Catholic church,

00:33:31.288 --> 00:33:32.200 align:middle line:90%
take a look at it.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:90%
You see the same exact design.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.400 align:middle line:84%
They've copied the
same exact setup

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
as these pyramidal
triptych designs

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the pyramids.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And you notice that we
have these god-self icons.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:44.282 align:middle line:10%
This is just three of them.

00:33:44.282 --> 00:33:46.240 align:middle line:10%
But they've been discovered
all over the world.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.905 align:middle line:10%
On every major continent,
these god-self icons

00:33:48.905 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:10%
have been discovered.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:10%
And they're all the same,
with just a slightly different

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.755 align:middle line:10%
look or feel to them.

00:33:52.755 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:10%
But they're all
basically the same.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.705 align:middle line:84%
So these people, like I
said, they were global.

00:33:56.705 --> 00:33:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But not only were they
global, you have to realize,

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.200 align:middle line:90%
they were also interplanetary.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.007 align:middle line:84%
If you look at some of the
original photos of the moon,

00:34:04.007 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:84%
you start to see
pyramids on the moon.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a sphinx on
the moon as well.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.987 align:middle line:84%
You look at the images coming
down from the Mars Rover,

00:34:10.987 --> 00:34:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Opportunity Rover, Spirit
Rover that went to Mars,

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.719 align:middle line:84%
and also the Mars
Global Surveyor.

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Because one of the things
I've done over the last five

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:19.645 align:middle line:84%
years, myself and
14 others, we've

00:34:19.645 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:84%
analyzed over one million
images from the space agencies.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.719 align:middle line:84%
And we've documented
58,000 anomalies.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:29.530 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the Mars data,
you start to see pyramids.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:90%
You start to see sphinxes--

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:90%
all the same thing.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.280 align:middle line:84%
These people went everywhere
in this entire solar system.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.133 align:middle line:84%
And they're very
powerful people.

00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids exist all
over the world.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.467 align:middle line:84%
They all had different
purposes and functions,

00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:43.199 align:middle line:90%
like I talked about yesterday.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:44.650 align:middle line:90%
Some were power plants.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:45.969 align:middle line:90%
Some were portals.

00:34:45.969 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Some were laboratories.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.005 align:middle line:90%
Some were clinics or hospitals.

00:34:51.005 --> 00:34:52.630 align:middle line:84%
They all had various
different purposes

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.925 align:middle line:84%
and various different
types of technologies.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:84%
They are multi-functional
stone computers

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.985 align:middle line:84%
that are capable of
doing a lot of things.

00:34:57.985 --> 00:34:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
they all have in common

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is they're built off of a
fractal type of a makeup

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.570 align:middle line:84%
or fractal technology,
which we talked

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.230 align:middle line:84%
about yesterday, which is
self-similar patterns that

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.030 align:middle line:90%
occur.

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.010 align:middle line:84%
They reoccur in
nature consistently.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But also, mankind has
then taken and adopted

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.550 align:middle line:84%
that same fractal
technology and utilized it

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.640 align:middle line:84%
for construction techniques
and also, more recently,

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
in video games.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a video game that
we talked about yesterday

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.230 align:middle line:90%
called "No Man's Sky."

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.945 align:middle line:84%
"No Man's Sky" has 80
quadrillion planets in it--

00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:27.745 align:middle line:90%
80 quadrillion.

00:35:27.745 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And every planet is inhabited
with lifeforms-- billions

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of life forms.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And this game fits on one disk.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And you put it in
a game console.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.540 align:middle line:90%
And it never ends.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.710 align:middle line:90%
The game never ends.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.540 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the
game can do all of that

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.980 align:middle line:84%
is because it's built off the
Mandelbrot fractal set, which

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.350 align:middle line:84%
is a very simple
mathematical equation that

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.380 align:middle line:84%
allows every frame to
occur when you need it.

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So just like in the
third dimension right

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.180 align:middle line:90%
now, we're sitting here.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And everything that's outside
of this room that you can't see

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even exist
as a solid object.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.750 align:middle line:90%
That's science fact.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.340 align:middle line:90%
That's quantum physics.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.215 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't exist until a
conscious observer analyzes

00:36:06.215 --> 00:36:08.590 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic waves and
collapses it into something

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.963 align:middle line:90%
we call matter.

00:36:09.963 --> 00:36:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
power of the mind.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But you take that
same exact concept,

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and you can put it into the
Mandelbrot set of fractals.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And you can create worlds,
planets, universes, even, which

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.880 align:middle line:90%
we already currently have done.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.105 align:middle line:10%
This is the grid, the planetary
grid, on Earth, right here.

00:36:25.105 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:10%
Not only does it represent
a fractal pattern,

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.950 align:middle line:10%
but also, every single
one of those points

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:10%
is a node-- electromagnetic,
geomagnetic node--

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.430 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.805 align:middle line:10%
And if you go to
every single one

00:36:35.805 --> 00:36:38.620 align:middle line:10%
of these points on
this image, you'll

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:10%
find a megalithic structure,
either on the Earth

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.570 align:middle line:10%
or submerged in the water.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:46.792 align:middle line:10%
Or you'll find a very, very
strong magnetic field there.

00:36:46.792 --> 00:36:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the ancients knew.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And they mapped
our planet out long

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:53.110 align:middle line:84%
before we even had any
technology to even figure out

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:84%
how to get from point A to
point B. As a matter of fact,

00:36:55.790 --> 00:37:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the Great Pyramid itself is an
archetype of the planet Earth.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.942 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid's
height is the exact height

00:37:03.942 --> 00:37:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of all of the landmass, the
average height of the landmass,

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.150 align:middle line:90%
on the entire planet.

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Think about that for a second.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.670 align:middle line:84%
In order for you
to build something

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.200 align:middle line:84%
say this is going to be the
average height of the landmass

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:84%
on the planet, you have
to scan the entire planet.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:22.030 align:middle line:84%
But you can't scan the
planet with regular satellite

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.320 align:middle line:90%
that goes around the equator.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to have
a polar orbiter.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.440 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
a satellite that

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.160 align:middle line:84%
orbits the planet in
this fashion and scans.

00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And each scan has to be
taken and stitched together.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.103 align:middle line:84%
But the scan has to have
ground-penetrating radar.

00:37:35.103 --> 00:37:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
able to make very

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.660 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated calculations.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, we are just learning
to do it ourselves, now.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.110 align:middle line:84%
If you go to USGS dot
gov, you can pull up

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:90%
radar scans like that.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.237 align:middle line:84%
We just started doing
north pole orbits--

00:37:45.237 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:84%
in other words, an orbiter
that actually can orbit

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:90%
the planet in this method--

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.200 align:middle line:90%
in the '80s.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.435 align:middle line:10%
So now you're talking
about advanced technology

00:37:52.435 --> 00:37:55.300 align:middle line:10%
in ancient times to be
able to scan a planet,

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.905 align:middle line:10%
use ground-penetrating
radar, come up

00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.988 align:middle line:10%
with the height of the
landmass around the planet,

00:37:58.988 --> 00:38:02.410 align:middle line:10%
get its average, and then build
a pyramid to that exact height.

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.140 align:middle line:84%
Also, the Great Pyramid is
located at the direct center

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:90%
of the landmass on the planet.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.800 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Not the center of the Earth,
the center of landmass.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, this requires
a global scan

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.013 align:middle line:84%
of all the land
and all the mass.

00:38:15.013 --> 00:38:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
figure out which point is

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:84%
the exact nodal point
to put this directly

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:90%
in the center of this landmass.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.502 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one
of many, many things.

00:38:22.502 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Gallery of the
Great Pyramid latitude

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.543 align:middle line:84%
is the same number of
digits as the speed of light

00:38:26.543 --> 00:38:27.590 align:middle line:90%
in meters per second.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's just
so many correlations.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.210 align:middle line:10%
And when you look down on
Giza at the Giza Plateau--

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:10%
and I have a very good
video about this--

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.367 align:middle line:10%
you realize that it's a
map of the inner planets

00:38:38.367 --> 00:38:39.200 align:middle line:10%
of our solar system.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And it matches the NASA
star map perfectly.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
So these are very
advanced people.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.840 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've built up
the credibility of the quality

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and the history of these
people and how they interacted

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and engaged mankind and the
quality of their technology

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.640 align:middle line:84%
and their mind, let's
talk a little bit

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.810 align:middle line:90%
about their Hermetica.

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Thoth himself is
the one that started

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.550 align:middle line:84%
this Hermetica and
these teachings,

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:02.680 align:middle line:90%
these hermetic teachings--

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Hermes, meaning Thoth.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Hermes Trismegistus is
another one of his names.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So he basically laid
out a guide for mankind

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that he knew at the time
wouldn't be able to take hold

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.120 align:middle line:90%
for the majority of the people.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.190 align:middle line:84%
Only a very small
few, handpicked people

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.930 align:middle line:90%
had access to this information.

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:24.910 align:middle line:84%
But it was a time capsule
waiting for people

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to arrive around the time of
the era that we're in right now.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.810 align:middle line:10%
"Hermes Trismegistus, master
of all arts and sciences,

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.360 align:middle line:10%
perfect in all crafts,
Ruler of the Three Worlds,

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:10%
Scribe of the Gods, and
Keeper of the Book of Life.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:10%
Thoth Hermes Trismegistus,
the Three Times the Greatest."

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Basically, that's what
"trismegistus" means--

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.550 align:middle line:10%
"three times the greatest."

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.620 align:middle line:84%
People used to think it
meant "three times born,"

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.610 align:middle line:90%
but it doesn't.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:47.155 align:middle line:10%
"He was the first
intelligencer"--

00:39:47.155 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:10%
In other words, he's an
educator, a teacher--

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.250 align:middle line:10%
service to others--

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.750 align:middle line:10%
"and was regarded by the ancient
Egyptians as the embodiment

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.190 align:middle line:10%
of the universal mind.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:10%
While in all probability
there actually

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.080 align:middle line:10%
existed a great sage and
educator by the name of Hermes,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.600 align:middle line:10%
it is impossible to
extricate the historical man

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.130 align:middle line:10%
from the mass of
legendary accounts

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:10%
which attempt to identify
him with the cosmic principle

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.340 align:middle line:10%
of thought."

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:84%
The word "thought"
came from Thoth.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Also, the land of Khem is where
you get the words chemistry

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy, which is where
he first landed in the Emerald

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Tablets and helped
raise them back

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.770 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level
of civilization,

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:19.335 align:middle line:90%
long before it was called Egypt.

00:40:19.335 --> 00:40:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk a
little bit about creation.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.565 align:middle line:84%
Some of this, some of you
may have seen yesterday.

00:40:23.565 --> 00:40:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But this is going to lead
us into where we're going

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:90%
with the Hermetic Principles.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:30.010 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning, Nous--"
who is also known as God--

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:84%
"created a second Nous,
who becomes a craftsman

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.590 align:middle line:90%
and creates the world.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.100 align:middle line:84%
Nous II creates seven
powers and the seven spheres

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.255 align:middle line:84%
around what will
become the Earth.

00:40:38.255 --> 00:40:40.630 align:middle line:84%
The spheres have no control
over what will be the Earth."

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
archetypes, here.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
creating a seed of life,

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.777 align:middle line:84%
using Earth and
planets as archetypes.

00:40:47.777 --> 00:40:49.360 align:middle line:84%
"They control what
we know as destiny.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.100 align:middle line:84%
The seven spheres are the moon,
sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars,

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.272 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:40:53.272 --> 00:40:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Here is the beginning
of astrology.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Nous II sets the
spheres in motion.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.950 align:middle line:90%
And life begins on earth."

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.950 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about here is the creation

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:03.460 align:middle line:84%
of the seed of life,
six circles that overlap

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:90%
each other with one circle.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.540 align:middle line:90%
And now you have seven spheres.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, every human being
that's born, this cell pattern

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:14.977 align:middle line:84%
forms and stays in the base
of your spine until you die.

00:41:14.977 --> 00:41:16.310 align:middle line:90%
It's there for your entire life.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:17.860 align:middle line:90%
This is the seed of life.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.500 align:middle line:84%
This pattern can be found
in all ancient texts,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.685 align:middle line:84%
all ancient architecture, no
matter how far back you go.

00:41:23.685 --> 00:41:25.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
further back you go,

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.280 align:middle line:84%
you realize they knew more
about it than we know right now.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.655 align:middle line:84%
We're just starting
to rediscover

00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:30.160 align:middle line:90%
what it's really all about.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:84%
This is a cross-cut
section of DNA.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.165 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're down to
the microscopic levels.

00:41:36.165 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Under an electron
microscope, you

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:84%
can see that a
cross-section of the DNA

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.520 align:middle line:84%
also resembles the seed
of life, flower of life.

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.460 align:middle line:84%
It's all down there are the
lowest, smallest levels.

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.730 align:middle line:84%
So what we're saying is this
is really a true as above,

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.580 align:middle line:84%
so below, which we're
going to get into.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And these people knew about
this in the ancient times.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.640 align:middle line:10%
Here it goes again, as you
see, starting with one sphere,

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.230 align:middle line:10%
and then multiplying
it down until you

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.650 align:middle line:10%
get to the actual flower
of life at the bottom.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.440 align:middle line:10%
And you can see how cells
can divide through mitosis

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.090 align:middle line:10%
and then create a
living organism.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.820 align:middle line:84%
This is just one example of the
power of the flower of life.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The flower of life is where all
of the energies emanate from.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.570 align:middle line:84%
All of the energies that fill
up this entire third dimension

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.690 align:middle line:84%
in our universe, all
of the dark matter,

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.450 align:middle line:84%
dark energy-- all these things
are emanating directly out

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.315 align:middle line:90%
of this flower of life pattern.

00:42:26.315 --> 00:42:27.690 align:middle line:84%
The flower of life
pattern is one

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.200 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful patterns
in the universe because why?

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You're literally looking
at the face of God.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.070 align:middle line:84%
This is what we talked
about yesterday.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.230 align:middle line:90%
God is not a man.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.205 align:middle line:84%
In my personal opinion, there
is no man that's called god.

00:42:39.205 --> 00:42:40.830 align:middle line:84%
You hear people
saying, he can do this.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to
do that for me.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.420 align:middle line:90%
He's going to do this for me.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.740 align:middle line:90%
He's going to do that for me.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
referencing the wrong things.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably
just regurgitating

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.600 align:middle line:84%
something that they
heard from relatives,

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and their
grandmother, whoever.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.670 align:middle line:90%
God is a divine frequency.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:54.600 align:middle line:90%
God is energy.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
"In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was God."

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
frequencies and vibration.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.080 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about cymatics.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about a
sky daddy with a magic wand.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It goes way deeper than that.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And I can guarantee
you one thing.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:11.220 align:middle line:84%
There is no book out there
in modern-day religion

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that has any reference to the
true creator of the universe.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.140 align:middle line:90%
They're all referencing people--

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%
people like me and you--
that put on their pants

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.978 align:middle line:84%
one leg at a time,
that masqueraded

00:43:20.978 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
as gods because they
were a little bit more

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.030 align:middle line:90%
advanced than us.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Here goes the flower
of life atomically

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.760 align:middle line:84%
burned into the
Osirian temple pillar

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.390 align:middle line:84%
that I've witnessed myself,
when I went there in 2014.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This Osirian temple is about
60,000, 70,000 years old.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:38.880 align:middle line:90%
It's partially buried.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And right behind it is
the Temple of Abydos.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.460 align:middle line:84%
In the temple of Abydos,
you look up about 30 meters

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.260 align:middle line:90%
above the ground.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.480 align:middle line:84%
If you look on some
of my pages, you'll

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.930 align:middle line:90%
see the videos that I took--

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:84%
helicopters, tanks,
airplanes in the hieroglyphs.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.202 align:middle line:84%
These are evidences of
advanced technology.

00:43:56.202 --> 00:43:57.660 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you go
throughout Egypt,

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.285 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
hieroglyphs closely,

00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:01.290 align:middle line:84%
you start to see pieces
of advanced technology

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:02.460 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, they knew about this
flower of life and the power

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that it was and that it
was the creation energy

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.330 align:middle line:84%
source from hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.672 align:middle line:84%
And this is another
evidence of it, here.

00:44:14.672 --> 00:44:16.380 align:middle line:84%
"In the creation myth,
we were introduced

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to astrology and the
influence of planets upon man,

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.840 align:middle line:84%
and from which man is
expected to rise above.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We have dualism-- a god
of the heavens and the one

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
who created earth.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.460 align:middle line:84%
We see an idea of man
as a son or part of god.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We have man being given
the power of creation.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:35.580 align:middle line:90%
You create your own reality.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the idea that man has
a dual nature, one in heaven--

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.370 align:middle line:84%
which is non-material,
the soul or the spirit--

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.730 align:middle line:84%
and one physical in the world
of matter, which is the body,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.623 align:middle line:84%
and the fall-- leaving from
heaven to be with nature."

00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:49.290 align:middle line:84%
These quote unquote
"fallen angels" that

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.050 align:middle line:84%
have been modified in some of
the modern-day religious texts

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.950 align:middle line:84%
weren't fallen angels the
way that it's been described

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and taught all these years.

00:44:57.210 --> 00:45:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the fall of the
divine consciousness that

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.480 align:middle line:84%
decided to finally divide itself
into trillions and trillions

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.630 align:middle line:84%
of entities and come
experience itself subjectively

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
from different perspectives
as different people

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.900 align:middle line:90%
on different planets.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So all of us, really,
are all one entity.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:13.620 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:15.173 align:middle line:90%
Separation is an illusion.

00:45:15.173 --> 00:45:16.590 align:middle line:84%
There is no you
sitting out there,

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:17.670 align:middle line:90%
and I'm standing up here.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.120 align:middle line:84%
We're all energetically the
same exact consciousness.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.833 align:middle line:84%
The only difference is
there's a different frequency

00:45:23.833 --> 00:45:26.250 align:middle line:84%
operating in me and a different
frequency of consciousness

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.450 align:middle line:90%
operating in you.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.452 align:middle line:84%
And then that gives us the
illusion of separation.

00:45:30.452 --> 00:45:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But there is no
separation because if you

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.330 align:middle line:84%
were to take all the matter
in this entire universe

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and backdate it all the
way back to day number one,

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll find out that we're
all in one gigantic ball,

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.990 align:middle line:84%
probably smaller than this
room, energetically connected.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And then as it expanded out--
as the energy expanded out,

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.710 align:middle line:84%
opening up this
spherical universe,

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.210 align:middle line:84%
you'll realize that we're all
still energetically connected.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And the proof of this is
through quantum physics.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.003 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
you have something

00:45:55.003 --> 00:45:56.550 align:middle line:90%
called quantum entanglement.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement, if you
want to do it in a laboratory,

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.250 align:middle line:90%
let's just go there first.

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.030 align:middle line:84%
You take a laser, and
you take two particles.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:06.240 align:middle line:84%
You do something called
parabolic down-conversion,

00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.820 align:middle line:84%
where you phase-shift
the frequency of both

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.680 align:middle line:84%
of those particles to
the same frequency.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.115 align:middle line:90%
Now they're entangled.

00:46:12.115 --> 00:46:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Once those two
particles are entangled,

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.780 align:middle line:84%
if you had the capability
to take one particle

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and send it to the other
end of the universe

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and have one particle here
with you, if you change

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the information in the particle
that's still there with you,

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:24.857 align:middle line:84%
the one on the other
end of the universe

00:46:24.857 --> 00:46:28.660 align:middle line:84%
responds instantaneously,
bypassing the speed of light.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.170 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.770 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is
because distance

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.480 align:middle line:90%
is an illusion as well.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.280 align:middle line:90%
There is no distance.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.340 align:middle line:84%
When you start to realize that
through quantum entanglement,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.790 align:middle line:84%
everything is energetically
connected on a grid.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:43.230 align:middle line:84%
We're all sitting
on this grid matrix.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.960 align:middle line:84%
And on this grid matrix, all
of the energy that we think

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
is solid matter is
really waves of energy.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
connected directly,

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.590 align:middle line:90%
like a gigantic internet.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And we're all
connected right now.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And when people
understand that, they'll

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.348 align:middle line:84%
start to see the world
a lot differently.

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:90%
That's where we need to get to.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.265 align:middle line:84%
We have to have other
people understand

00:47:01.265 --> 00:47:02.470 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not talking to you.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:03.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to myself.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
talking to somebody,

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.460 align:middle line:90%
you're talking to yourself.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Because there's only
one consciousness.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Separation, like I said
before, is an illusion.

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that, then you

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.360 align:middle line:90%
treat people differently.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.818 align:middle line:84%
You talk to people
differently when

00:47:15.818 --> 00:47:17.710 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
they're really you.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into the
universe runs on natural law.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.140 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to cover
the Principle of Mentalism,

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.230 align:middle line:10%
the Principle of Correspondence,
the Principle of Vibration,

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.990 align:middle line:10%
the Principle of Polarity,
the Principle of Rhythm,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:31.810 align:middle line:10%
the Principle of
Cause and Effect,

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.615 align:middle line:10%
and the Principle of Gender.

00:47:33.615 --> 00:47:35.240 align:middle line:84%
These are the Seven
Hermetic Principles

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.633 align:middle line:84%
that Thoth covers in
the Hermetic Principles.

00:47:38.633 --> 00:47:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I also cover these
in my book, "Compendium

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Emerald Tablets,"
which, by the way, since we're

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.480 align:middle line:84%
probably not going to have
enough time to go over

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.313 align:middle line:84%
that at the end, if you
don't have the book,

00:47:46.313 --> 00:47:49.050 align:middle line:84%
you can go to 4bidden
Knowledge dot com and get it.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:50.310 align:middle line:90%
That's with the number 4--

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.400 align:middle line:90%
4, b, i, d, d, e, n--

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.750 align:middle line:84%
4bidden Knowledge with
the number 4 dot com.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And you can get
the book on there.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Where some of these
principles really

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.010 align:middle line:84%
stem from in more modern
times, even though it's still

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:05.510 align:middle line:84%
thousands of years ago, would
be the Kybalion, or Kybalion.

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.360 align:middle line:84%
"The principles of
the truth are seven.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.810 align:middle line:84%
He who knows these
understandingly

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.480 align:middle line:84%
possesses the magic
key, before whose touch

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.000 align:middle line:84%
all of the doors of the
temple will fly open."

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
ancient wisdom that's

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.650 align:middle line:84%
so powerful that the
doors of the temple--

00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:20.750 align:middle line:84%
what are the doors
of the temple?

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.550 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
spend a lot of time

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of money going
to these physical buildings

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.830 align:middle line:84%
that they call
temples and churches.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.140 align:middle line:84%
But the real temples
are right here.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:31.842 align:middle line:84%
What this is saying
is when you acquire

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:34.300 align:middle line:84%
this wisdom and this knowledge
and understand it and digest

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.210 align:middle line:84%
it and meditate on it and
work it and experience it, all

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.920 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, the temples
of these doors fly open.

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.420 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
temple is located.

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.580 align:middle line:84%
These are your real
temples, not the buildings

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:45.680 align:middle line:90%
out there in the streets.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's go over the
Principle of Mentalism.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:51.260 align:middle line:84%
"All is mind, and the
universe is mental."

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This is kind of
what we were talking

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.830 align:middle line:84%
about yesterday in my talk
about the fractal holographic

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.330 align:middle line:84%
universe, which we're going to
have to touch on a little bit

00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:59.900 align:middle line:84%
because it has a
lot to do with this.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really and truly, you
do create your own reality.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have
listened to that.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:04.820 align:middle line:90%
And they've heard it.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:90%
And they go, you know what?

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.483 align:middle line:84%
There are things
that I can't control.

00:49:07.483 --> 00:49:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are things
that come in and interact

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.917 align:middle line:90%
with your reality tunnel.

00:49:11.917 --> 00:49:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is what a lot of
people don't understand.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.427 align:middle line:84%
Collectively, we help
to create reality.

00:49:16.427 --> 00:49:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you really
understand that everything

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.350 align:middle line:84%
is an electromagnetic
wave that flows--

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and right now, even
in here, in this room,

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.260 align:middle line:84%
there are trillions
and trillions

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.552 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic waves
passing through us right now--

00:49:26.552 --> 00:49:28.850 align:middle line:84%
passing through our
reality tunnels.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you're working
on something,

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:34.012 align:middle line:84%
and something blindsides you
that you weren't expecting,

00:49:34.012 --> 00:49:35.720 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy and
very possible for that

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:38.240 align:middle line:84%
to happen because there are
other entities and other people

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:40.130 align:middle line:84%
out there and different
reality tunnels that

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.200 align:middle line:84%
are corresponding or
correlating or crossing over

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.690 align:middle line:84%
your tunnel at that moment,
which can interact directly

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:47.150 align:middle line:84%
with everything you're doing
and what you have going on.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:50.070 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you're over here,

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're going this way and
down this pathway in your life,

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden you
meet somebody that becomes

00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:59.420 align:middle line:84%
your friend, becomes your
lover, you have a child,

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.880 align:middle line:84%
those reality paths, now,
those tunnels have crossed.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they merge together
and go on in one direction.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So reality tunnels are a
part of the fractal matrix

00:50:10.970 --> 00:50:12.410 align:middle line:90%
that we're living in.

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:15.667 align:middle line:84%
But when we're saying
that all is mental,

00:50:15.667 --> 00:50:17.750 align:middle line:84%
you really have to understand
that what you think,

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:90%
you truly do become.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:22.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you are thinking
negative all the time,

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.290 align:middle line:84%
thinking down all
the time, thinking

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:84%
things that are
low-frequency things,

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:28.280 align:middle line:84%
you will then begin to
attract those things.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you tonight
how that actually works,

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.170 align:middle line:84%
how that law of
attraction works.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.807 align:middle line:84%
It works both on positive and
also works on negative as well.

00:50:34.807 --> 00:50:36.140 align:middle line:90%
And you have to understand that.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's very important not
only what you're thinking,

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.820 align:middle line:90%
but also what you're saying.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.423 align:middle line:84%
Words have the ultimate power
over the ether of space-time.

00:50:44.423 --> 00:50:45.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is what Thoth knew.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.990 align:middle line:84%
This is why in the book,
there's words in there

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.132 align:middle line:90%
that he has you say.

00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:50.090 align:middle line:90%
But these aren't names.

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.340 align:middle line:84%
They look like names of
people, but they're not names.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:55.130 align:middle line:84%
These words are frequencies for
you to utter out of your mouth.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And when you utter
these frequencies,

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.390 align:middle line:84%
it helps to alter your
reality tunnel and your path.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:00.690 align:middle line:90%
That's how powerful it is.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And he understood
that from early on.

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:06.620 align:middle line:84%
I was saying the other day,
you wake up in the morning,

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.270 align:middle line:90%
and you want to have a good day.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And you say to yourself, I'm
going to have a good day.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
a good day today.

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:11.998 align:middle line:90%
You're saying it to yourself.

00:51:11.998 --> 00:51:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:17.300 align:middle line:84%
If you verbally say, I'm going
to have a good day today.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
to fall in place.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.170 align:middle line:90%
My path is going to be guided.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to reach
my ultimate goals.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And you verbally say that, all
of a sudden, something magical

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.500 align:middle line:90%
happens.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:84%
You have just now put out
into the universe spoken

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.720 align:middle line:90%
word backed by intention.

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.460 align:middle line:84%
This is where a lot
of people get lost.

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:36.990 align:middle line:84%
They go, you know, I've
been thinking, I want this.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:90%
I want this.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:37.830 align:middle line:90%
I want this.

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I want this to happen.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:39.513 align:middle line:90%
I want that to happen.

00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't seem
like it's happening.

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.260 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
speaking anything.

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking
only in their mind.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.680 align:middle line:90%
That works a little bit.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But there's more power in speech
because frequency and vibration

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:52.640 align:middle line:84%
create everything in
the third dimension.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
matter what language

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:58.520 align:middle line:84%
you're speaking because the
universe speaks every language.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.530 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as I
invented something or I thought

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.110 align:middle line:90%
of that, I had this great idea.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:07.850 align:middle line:84%
All information that is taught
or learned or discovered--

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:09.680 align:middle line:84%
really, rediscovered--
is already

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.290 align:middle line:90%
out there in space time.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:13.990 align:middle line:84%
You have literally received
a download of information.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.725 align:middle line:84%
When an idea comes
to you, that's

00:52:15.725 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:84%
because you were on
the right frequency

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.090 align:middle line:90%
to receive that information.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Your mind was in a right
position consciously

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to have the ability to dissect
it, digest it, and then

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.900 align:middle line:84%
maybe even regurgitate it, or
then maybe put action behind it

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.060 align:middle line:90%
and recreate it, whatever it is.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:33.610 align:middle line:84%
There is no such thing as
I came up with an idea.

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:34.923 align:middle line:90%
Everything already exists.

00:52:34.923 --> 00:52:36.340 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
new under the sun.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.147 align:middle line:90%
Everything already exists.

00:52:38.147 --> 00:52:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So when you understand
these concepts,

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and you understand the
power of vocalization,

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:44.027 align:middle line:84%
you'll begin to
talk out loud more.

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm always whispering
stuff around me.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Even my fiance, she goes,
hey, what did you say?

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm just talking myself.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.150 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:51.710 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to speak.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.510 align:middle line:90%
Speak it.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:54.093 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how loud or how low.

00:52:54.093 --> 00:52:56.328 align:middle line:84%
But once it comes
out, it's out there.

00:52:56.328 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to realize.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.453 align:middle line:84%
And when you realize how
powerful those words are,

00:52:59.453 --> 00:53:02.020 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to realize when
you say something to somebody

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.670 align:middle line:90%
how delicate that can be.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
remember Dr. Masaru

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Emoto, who did the
water experiments,

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.410 align:middle line:90%
put the water into jars.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And then he wrote words
on pieces of paper

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:15.880 align:middle line:90%
and taped it to the jars.

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.170 align:middle line:90%
"I love you."

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.730 align:middle line:90%
He put a prayer on one.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:19.925 align:middle line:90%
"I hate you.

00:53:19.925 --> 00:53:20.800 align:middle line:90%
I wish you were dead.

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll kill you."

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.300 align:middle line:84%
The ones that had positive
affirmations on them,

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.890 align:middle line:84%
when he took a droplet
out of those jars of water

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and put it under
a microscope, they

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.910 align:middle line:84%
formed beautiful
crystalline structures.

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:34.090 align:middle line:84%
The ones that he put "I hate
you" and "I want to kill you,"

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.950 align:middle line:84%
when he took a droplet
out of those jars

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and put them under
a microscope, they

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:39.850 align:middle line:90%
were malformed, dark, and ugly.

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Some of them weren't
even crystals at all.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the
importance of this?

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:46.430 align:middle line:90%
The human body is 70% water.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you're talking about
yourself in a bad way--

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.020 align:middle line:90%
"I suck.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:50.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm dumb.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:51.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm stupid."

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.412 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is
happening to the water

00:53:53.412 --> 00:53:54.400 align:middle line:90%
molecules in your body?

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.080 align:middle line:90%
They're taking that energy.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And you're just
destroying yourself.

00:53:57.970 --> 00:53:59.080 align:middle line:90%
You're altering your DNA.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:00.880 align:middle line:84%
You're putting a low
frequency out there

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that's coming right
back into your own body

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and changing the structure,
the atomic structure,

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.030 align:middle line:90%
of the molecules in your body.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you're talking
to somebody else--

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:15.010 align:middle line:84%
this is why sometimes I get
so irked when I see parents

00:54:15.010 --> 00:54:17.440 align:middle line:90%
going crazy on their kids.

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.903 align:middle line:84%
Because if the kid is doing
something wrong, of course,

00:54:19.903 --> 00:54:21.320 align:middle line:84%
you've got to get
their attention.

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But when I see what I
consider to be verbal abuse,

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:28.220 align:middle line:84%
it just irks me because I
understand the negative impact

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that it's having on
that kid's physiology.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.737 align:middle line:84%
And those kind of things
don't go away instantly.

00:54:34.737 --> 00:54:36.820 align:middle line:84%
When you-- "I'm going to
slap you into next week,"

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and "I'm going to beat
you down," and "Get out

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of my face," and "You suck,"
and "You're this and that,"

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.350 align:middle line:90%
bah, bah, bah.

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:43.900 align:middle line:90%
Those are long-term effects.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Not long-term effects because
of just the memory of the mind

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:51.190 align:middle line:84%
hearing it, long-term effects on
the physiology of the body that

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:53.800 align:middle line:84%
can cause all kinds of
problems in the future--

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.790 align:middle line:84%
different types of cancers,
sicknesses, diabetes.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.310 align:middle line:84%
A kid may now be
turned to relying more

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:03.310 align:middle line:84%
on different types of foods that
maybe they wouldn't normally

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:04.290 align:middle line:90%
want to eat.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:06.040 align:middle line:84%
All different types
of things can happen--

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.990 align:middle line:84%
becoming bullies and
all these other--

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:10.715 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that goes into
the physiology of the body.

00:55:10.715 --> 00:55:11.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not just mental.

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.690 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a physical thing.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:16.420 align:middle line:84%
The entire body takes
on those effects.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's very powerful
to talk positive affirmations

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.700 align:middle line:90%
to kids.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.570 align:middle line:84%
A kid is doing something
wrong, of course,

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:24.400 align:middle line:84%
you've got to
straighten them out.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.565 align:middle line:90%
But there's ways to do it.

00:55:25.565 --> 00:55:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
the way to do it,

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:29.560 align:middle line:84%
then go get books
and self-help books

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and learn the right way to
talk to kids because that's

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.510 align:middle line:90%
our future.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep tearing them
down and destroying them,

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:36.960 align:middle line:90%
we're going to have no future.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be stuck
in this cycle of trying

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to relearn all this
information and try

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.503 align:middle line:84%
to get out of this matrix
system that we're in.

00:55:43.503 --> 00:55:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And we keep wondering why
we're spinning our wheels.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we're
destroying the youth--

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:51.320 align:middle line:84%
the youth are the most
important people coming up.

00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody remember
the movie "The Matrix?"

00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:57.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, Neo, they called
him Neo not because they just

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.040 align:middle line:90%
wanted to have the name Neo.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.370 align:middle line:84%
It's the neocortex
in the human brain.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.140 align:middle line:90%
That's why they called him Neo.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.860 align:middle line:84%
"The neocortex is Latin for
"new bark" or "new rind."

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.655 align:middle line:84%
Also called the neopallium,
which is "new mantle,"

00:56:11.655 --> 00:56:14.248 align:middle line:84%
it is a part of the
brain in mammals.

00:56:14.248 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It is the outer layer of
the cerebral hemispheres

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and made up of six layers,
labeled 1 through 6."

00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:20.947 align:middle line:90%
So this is the neocortex.

00:56:20.947 --> 00:56:21.780 align:middle line:90%
It's all about mind.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.160 align:middle line:84%
See, "The Matrix," the
movie, these people,

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.452 align:middle line:90%
they know about all this stuff.

00:56:24.452 --> 00:56:28.200 align:middle line:84%
They know how powerful these
things are, these names are,

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.490 align:middle line:90%
these terms are.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And they dropped
little seeds on you.

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.150 align:middle line:84%
They hide everything
in plain sight.

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the big things
about the movie "The Matrix,"

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.640 align:middle line:84%
not only did it expose
the fact that we're

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.665 align:middle line:84%
living in a real
matrix, but it also

00:56:40.665 --> 00:56:43.290 align:middle line:84%
exposed the fact that everything
is mental, everything is mind,

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:45.030 align:middle line:90%
just like Thoth said.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be surprised
if the young lady that

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:49.363 align:middle line:90%
wrote this original story--

00:56:49.363 --> 00:56:51.030 align:middle line:84%
it was actually a
young, black lady that

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:53.280 align:middle line:90%
wrote this story, "The Matrix."

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.238 align:middle line:84%
And it was later then
stolen by those brothers.

00:56:55.238 --> 00:56:57.822 align:middle line:84%
And she won the case in court,
but still hasn't been paid yet,

00:56:57.822 --> 00:56:58.830 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't be
surprised if she

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.960 align:middle line:84%
was a studier of the
Hermetic Principles

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.347 align:middle line:84%
and also studier of Thoth
and the Emerald Tablets.

00:57:08.347 --> 00:57:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So we're living in a fractal
holographic universe,

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:12.757 align:middle line:84%
which Thoth talks about
in the Emerald Tablets.

00:57:12.757 --> 00:57:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, and it's important
to understand this

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:16.450 align:middle line:84%
because we touched
on this yesterday,

00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:17.950 align:middle line:84%
but it really, truly
has a lot to do

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.492 align:middle line:90%
with everything is mental.

00:57:19.492 --> 00:57:20.950 align:middle line:84%
When you understand
that-- and this

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:25.480 align:middle line:84%
is me, standing at the
Field Museum in Chicago.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.990 align:middle line:84%
There was an exhibition
there about fractals.

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And on this wall, you're
looking at fractals.

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:34.900 align:middle line:10%
And they're showing how
fractals basically are

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.610 align:middle line:10%
recurring in nature everywhere.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:90%
They also had computer displays.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:40.910 align:middle line:84%
They were showing how fractals
create mountains, oceans,

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:44.480 align:middle line:84%
lakes, rivers, trees, your
lungs, and your body--

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.280 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Also, one thing that
people don't realize--

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:51.230 align:middle line:84%
fractal patterns can be tracked
into financial systems as well.

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.398 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at
financial system economics

00:57:53.398 --> 00:57:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and you put them on
a computer graph,

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:57.190 align:middle line:84%
you start to realize that,
without even us knowing it,

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.910 align:middle line:84%
we're following a
fractal pattern.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Where did "The
Matrix" come from?

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.490 align:middle line:90%
"The Matrix" came from--

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.357 align:middle line:84%
they got it from the Bible
and the Torah, really,

00:58:06.357 --> 00:58:07.440 align:middle line:90%
is where they got it from.

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:10.290 align:middle line:84%
They didn't get it from-- they
just made up the term "matrix."

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.430 align:middle line:84%
The term "matrix" is
not a modern-day word

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:14.290 align:middle line:90%
that just came out of nowhere.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:90%
It's an ancient word.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you open up the King
James Bible or the Torah,

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:20.300 align:middle line:90%
you're going to find it.

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find these versus,
Exodus 13-12, Exodus 13-15,

00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Exodus 34-19, Numbers
3-12, Numbers 18-15.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:29.940 align:middle line:90%
This is where it comes from.

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:31.080 align:middle line:90%
And what does it mean?

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.270 align:middle line:84%
In these ancient
texts, it means you

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.550 align:middle line:84%
need to be born out of the
womb to receive a higher

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:37.800 align:middle line:90%
level of consciousness.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And what happens in
the movie "The Matrix?"

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Neo comes out of the
technological womb.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And he wakes up.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And then he's spit out,
and he's born again.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.660 align:middle line:10%
This is what it means to
come out of the matrix.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is what it's
talking about in the Torah

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and the modern-day Bible.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:54.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
look it up, take

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.720 align:middle line:84%
a screenshot of that and
blows somebody's mind.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:00.147 align:middle line:84%
The term "the matrix," the
movie didn't get it from just

00:59:00.147 --> 00:59:01.230 align:middle line:90%
off the top of their head.

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.165 align:middle line:84%
They got it from
these ancient texts.

00:59:03.165 --> 00:59:06.070 align:middle line:90%


00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:07.550 align:middle line:84%
"Reality is built
out of thought.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.307 align:middle line:84%
And every one of your thoughts
begin to create reality."

00:59:10.307 --> 00:59:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And somebody said
to me the other day,

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:14.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, I know you're
saying everything is mind

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.910 align:middle line:90%
and thoughts create reality.

00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:18.250 align:middle line:84%
But I really don't have
a real simple example

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:20.470 align:middle line:90%
because it's so ambiguous.

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:23.080 align:middle line:90%
So I gave him an example.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.850 align:middle line:90%
You have a cell phone, here.

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:26.710 align:middle line:90%
We all have them now.

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:29.680 align:middle line:84%
One day, somebody
said to themselves,

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.320 align:middle line:84%
boy, it'd be so cool to be able
to communicate from a device

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.000 align:middle line:84%
that I can walk around
with in my pocket.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.380 align:middle line:84%
And then that person now
began the process of thought

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:42.560 align:middle line:84%
on an object that can
be used as a tool.

00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.750 align:middle line:84%
That person then visualized that
object in his mind or her mind.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Then that visualization
turned into paper.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.350 align:middle line:90%
Let me get a paper.

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:52.150 align:middle line:90%
Let me get a pen.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:53.108 align:middle line:90%
Let me write this down.

00:59:53.108 --> 00:59:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Let me draw it out.

00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.160 align:middle line:84%
This is what it
should look like.

00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:59.393 align:middle line:84%
Then from there, OK, I've got
to contact some engineers.

00:59:59.393 --> 01:00:00.560 align:middle line:90%
They contact some engineers.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Engineers then take
it, put it into a CAD--

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.040 align:middle line:84%
a CAD design, computer-assisted
design in modern times, now.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, they
get it over to a factory

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:11.420 align:middle line:90%
that then replicates the parts.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And then now, we
have enough parts

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.532 align:middle line:84%
to put together a
template-- a real one

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:17.990 align:middle line:84%
that we can start to play with,
touch, feel, say, OK, let's

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.948 align:middle line:90%
make this, adjust this.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.515 align:middle line:90%
Let's change this around here.

01:00:20.515 --> 01:00:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
thing you know,

01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.265 align:middle line:84%
we link up with
other people that

01:00:23.265 --> 01:00:26.240 align:middle line:84%
have technological advancements
that they've put out there

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:29.392 align:middle line:84%
through thought, like cell-phone
towers and magnetic microwaves

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.350 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.517 align:middle line:90%
And you put it all together.

01:00:31.517 --> 01:00:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, you have a cell
phone that works.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:37.153 align:middle line:84%
Every single aspect of this cell
phone started inside the mind

01:00:37.153 --> 01:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and then became a
physical object.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for
everything that we

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:41.810 align:middle line:90%
have in here that's man-made.

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.570 align:middle line:84%
This stage, these
speakers, these screens--

01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
it all started in
your mind first.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And then, it manifested
into reality.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
This is why, when
you get information

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
that comes into your mind, you
have to analyze it and then see

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.140 align:middle line:84%
if it's really
something that you

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:00.698 align:middle line:84%
can help in service to the
world or utilize for yourself.

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
I'll put it out there because
we're getting information

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:04.520 align:middle line:90%
on a consistent basis.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.310 align:middle line:84%
How does this
information get to us?

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, they found out
that 1 gram of human DNA,

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:13.490 align:middle line:84%
which is enough to put on
the tip of your finger,

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.668 align:middle line:84%
can store 700 terabytes
of digital data.

01:01:16.668 --> 01:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So they took a gram of
DNA, and they connected it

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:19.762 align:middle line:90%
to a computer.

01:01:19.762 --> 01:01:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And they uploaded the
Library of Congress

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.053 align:middle line:84%
and downloaded the
Library of Congress

01:01:23.053 --> 01:01:26.002 align:middle line:90%
onto it, like a regular laptop.

01:01:26.002 --> 01:01:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Then they said, wow,
this is incredible--

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:28.510 align:middle line:90%
0's and 1's.

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.140 align:middle line:90%
DNA reads 0's and 1's?

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Then they discovered--
guess what?

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:33.710 align:middle line:90%
It also receives Wi-Fi.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So DNA sends and receives
Wi-Fi information,

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%
digital information-- invisible.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm transmitting out to you.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:42.680 align:middle line:90%
You're transmitting to me.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.555 align:middle line:84%
We're transmitting all
to each other in here,

01:01:44.555 --> 01:01:46.040 align:middle line:90%
whether we realize it or not.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.895 align:middle line:84%
And to confirm this, when I was
attending MIT in neuroscience,

01:01:51.895 --> 01:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
we had in class

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that
we're all transmitting

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
sending and receiving
wireless information

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
to each other every single
second of every single day.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
My field probably projects
out at least from up here,

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.395 align:middle line:84%
probably maybe even 8
to 10 feet ahead of me.

01:02:06.395 --> 01:02:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of you are
sitting so close together,

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.853 align:middle line:84%
all of your fields
are all interacting

01:02:09.853 --> 01:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
with each other right now,
sending and receiving data

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:16.908 align:middle line:84%
from each other
consistently, nonstop.

01:02:16.908 --> 01:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you're sitting
there, like I said before,

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting information
that you're saying is an idea,

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
or I'm saying you're getting it
downloaded, how does that work?

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is receiving
the information.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
One human body has enough DNA
to store all the information

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning
of time until now--

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
beginning of time in this
one universe that we have--

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.700 align:middle line:90%
13.5 billion years.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So you have inside of your
body 13.5 billion years

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:43.500 align:middle line:84%
of information right now,
right at this second.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
the human body is.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.240 align:middle line:84%
This is why if
you look into some

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.990 align:middle line:84%
of the other things
about alien abductions

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, which I
believe are real and true,

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.470 align:middle line:84%
they want to find out how to
merge with our technology.

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.518 align:middle line:84%
We're built into a very
sophisticated technology.

01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
learn how to use it.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.830 align:middle line:90%
And maybe even find a way--

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
some of them may not
be people or beings

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:10.400 align:middle line:84%
that have the capability of
transcending this dimension.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.920 align:middle line:90%
But we can.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.945 align:middle line:84%
And they may want to merge
with us for that purpose.

01:03:14.945 --> 01:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how
the Law of Attraction

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.770 align:middle line:90%
works-- general relativity.

01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
"General relativity is a name
given to Einstein's theory

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.242 align:middle line:90%
of gravity.

01:03:22.242 --> 01:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with the
curvature of space time

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and how mass or gravity can
actually warp or bend space.

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
We as humans have the ability
to bend the matrix to our will,

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:32.360 align:middle line:84%
using nothing more
than our mind.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the
matrix is space time,

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:36.035 align:middle line:84%
and our minds are
the gravity wells.

01:03:36.035 --> 01:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere that we go
in the third dimension,

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
we create warped
space in the matrix."

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So right now, you
see here the earth.

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And you see space
warped around it.

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:48.830 align:middle line:84%
That's space and time
warped around the Earth.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Right now, even
around your bodies,

01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
space is warped
around your bodies.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Any mass warps space.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.410 align:middle line:90%
This is a science fact, OK?

01:03:57.410 --> 01:04:00.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, this is how it
works when we're talking

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.140 align:middle line:90%
about the Law of Attraction.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Replace the Earth
with your mind, OK?

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.960 align:middle line:84%
So in that place, I put
Albert Einstein's head.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have Albert
Einstein's head, here.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we have below,
the first arrow going down,

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
which is trying to
quantum entangle

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
with the Christ Consciousness.

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.890 align:middle line:84%
The Christ Consciousness,
some people

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
call it, or the
universal consciousness,

01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.240 align:middle line:90%
is what you want to sync with.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And how do you sync
with that consciousness?

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I talked
about yesterday,

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:33.730 align:middle line:90%
when you are praying--

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:36.090 align:middle line:84%
and if you're praying from
a position of begging,

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:38.105 align:middle line:84%
you're probably not
going to get any results.

01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you get
some results, it's

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
probably just a coincidence.

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.370 align:middle line:10%
And you thought something
really happened.

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.550 align:middle line:10%
But the majority of the
time, nothing ever happens.

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.833 align:middle line:90%
Like I said before--

01:04:45.833 --> 01:04:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I was talking about
it yesterday--

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
there's 7.5 billion
people on this planet.

01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Of those 7.5 billion
people, 85.9% are religious.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's trillions of prayers
going up every single day.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.932 align:middle line:84%
And yet, look at the
state of the world.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't look too bleak.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:03.920 align:middle line:84%
It looks good--
looks kind of bleak.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.128 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's getting better
with the Conscious Movement.

01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
But we've still got a
very long way to go.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
So you have to realize
that what's going on here

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is the position of begging
is a weak position.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:19.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a low-frequency position.

01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
When you're going,
please, help me.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.517 align:middle line:90%
And I can't do this.

01:05:22.517 --> 01:05:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And I need help with that.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.767 align:middle line:90%
And I can't pay my mortgage.

01:05:24.767 --> 01:05:25.610 align:middle line:90%
And I can't do this.

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:26.410 align:middle line:90%
And I'm sick.

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And help this one, and so forth
and so on, that is begging.

01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.140 align:middle line:84%
If I took an electrode
cap and put it

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.060 align:middle line:84%
on your head, connected
it to a computer that

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
can read the output of
your mind, your frequency

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
of your mind, I will
show you in real science

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.650 align:middle line:84%
that what you're doing
with that kind of prayer

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
is generating a very
low-frequency vibration.

01:05:44.590 --> 01:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And the oscillations are
very wide and far apart

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.828 align:middle line:84%
on the screen, which
means they're coming,

01:05:48.828 --> 01:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
they're overlapping very small
parts of your DNA on their way

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:52.000 align:middle line:90%
out.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going to sync
with anything in the universe.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.795 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
have no power whatsoever.

01:05:56.795 --> 01:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
For hundreds of years-- maybe
thousands of years-- people

01:05:59.170 --> 01:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
have been praying the wrong
way-- well, some people.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The people in the
east, some of them

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
have mastered it because they
don't believe in begging.

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:07.270 align:middle line:90%
They believe in commanding.

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.150 align:middle line:84%
So when you pray from
a position of power,

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
when you are commanding and
understanding and believing

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
that the end has already
happened, that it already

01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
is done, this is
the prayer that you

01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:19.930 align:middle line:84%
get in some of
the monks in Tibet

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
and some of the doctors, the
holistic doctors, in China.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Their prayer says basically, in
their language, "It is done."

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:29.675 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, they
were doing a healing

01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:31.300 align:middle line:84%
on a woman who had
gall bladder cancer.

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:33.008 align:middle line:84%
And she had a ball
inside of her bladder.

01:06:33.008 --> 01:06:38.235 align:middle line:84%
And they had it live on TV
with this sonic machine.

01:06:38.235 --> 01:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And as they're
saying the prayer,

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:43.720 align:middle line:84%
which was [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
which means "It is done,"

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
you see it just melting
and disappearing.

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.050 align:middle line:84%
This was a Gregg
Braden video, which

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:49.120 align:middle line:90%
is still on YouTube right now.

01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And when he asked him,
why did this work?

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:54.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, because we're
already committed

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
to understanding that the
woman is already healed.

01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
In the West, you guys
are not praying that way.

01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
You're hoping for
things to happen.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
And what do we do when
we're saying these prayers?

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.235 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to cast spells.

01:07:09.235 --> 01:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Literally, I mean, that's
what everything is.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Bible and all that
stuff is just books of spells.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.847 align:middle line:84%
When you pray, you're
trying to-- that's

01:07:14.847 --> 01:07:16.390 align:middle line:90%
why they call it "spelling."

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to cast
spells all the time.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.108 align:middle line:84%
But you're trying to
cast a spell in sync

01:07:20.108 --> 01:07:22.525 align:middle line:84%
with something that doesn't
understand what you're saying.

01:07:22.525 --> 01:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to interface
with a universe that's digital.

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can't interface
with that digital interface

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
because why?

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't read your
programming language.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
When you go from a position of
power, your frequency goes up.

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to put that
same cap on your head,

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.470 align:middle line:84%
and put the electrodes on you,
and look on a computer screen

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
and have you say,
"I am powerful.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:42.940 align:middle line:90%
Divinity runs through me.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:45.280 align:middle line:90%
I am God, and God is me.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.330 align:middle line:90%
Bless my life.

01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:49.060 align:middle line:90%
Bless my path to my destination.

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.260 align:middle line:90%
Bless this food.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I bless this food.

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
a successful day.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
My business is going
to be thriving.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.157 align:middle line:84%
My relationship is
going to be successful."

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And then when I look
at the computer screen,

01:07:58.990 --> 01:08:00.198 align:middle line:90%
guess what's going to happen?

01:08:00.198 --> 01:08:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to see very small
oscillations, which means

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:03.947 align:middle line:90%
you're on a higher frequency.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And those oscillations, those
vibrations and frequencies

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
coming out of your
body, your mind,

01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:11.575 align:middle line:84%
are touching many more
nodes on your DNA.

01:08:11.575 --> 01:08:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that now, you're
getting ready to get

01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:14.560 align:middle line:90%
into quantum entanglement.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happening here
with this brain on TV, here.

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.180 align:middle line:90%
You see Einstein.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.819 align:middle line:84%
He's syncing with the
universal consciousness.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And then that is now syncing
with the divinity, which

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
is the flower of
life, which emanates

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.380 align:middle line:90%
all life and all things.

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens is you
see the arrow coming back

01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:35.840 align:middle line:90%
toward Einstein's head.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a gravity
well, now-- a gravity well that

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.189 align:middle line:84%
you've created with a high
frequency of consciousness.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And now, everything that
you're talking about

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that you want to happen
is now falling toward you.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.970 align:middle line:90%
How do satellites stay in orbit?

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.950 align:middle line:84%
They fall towards
the planet Earth.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:53.500 align:middle line:84%
They fall towards the planet
Earth at a specific speed

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.210 align:middle line:90%
to maintain their orbit.

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:58.883 align:middle line:84%
If one thing changes-- one
iota, one little bit here,

01:08:58.883 --> 01:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
one little bit there--
they break orbit.

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:02.615 align:middle line:84%
And then they start to
crash to the planet.

01:09:02.615 --> 01:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
This is what we're
talking about, here.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.290 align:middle line:90%
Everything is orbiting you.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:06.998 align:middle line:84%
Everything you need
is already out there.

01:09:06.998 --> 01:09:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything you need
is already out there.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's just out of your reach
until you create this gravity

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.600 align:middle line:84%
well, which then drops and
sinks and lets everything

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.356 align:middle line:90%
fall directly into your life.

01:09:18.356 --> 01:09:20.439 align:middle line:84%
And this was something
that I discovered and began

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:21.840 align:middle line:90%
to utilize for myself.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:23.090 align:middle line:90%
And let me tell you something.

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It's totally and
absolutely amazing.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I want,
everything that I need,

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.140 align:middle line:90%
it happens.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
It comes to fruition.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt in my mind
that it's going to happen.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.189 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you an example.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:38.052 align:middle line:84%
I said to myself
three years ago,

01:09:38.052 --> 01:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
traveling this planet.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be going to
every single ancient site

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.352 align:middle line:84%
that I can find and I can
dig up on this planet.

01:09:44.352 --> 01:09:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to be there in person--
touch it, feel it, and smell

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:49.390 align:middle line:84%
it, do my own research,
bring my own cameras,

01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:50.859 align:middle line:90%
record my own information.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to have one of the
largest social media sites

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:54.160 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.868 align:middle line:84%
I want people to follow
me and track down

01:09:55.868 --> 01:09:57.040 align:middle line:90%
this ancient information.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.020 align:middle line:84%
All these things that
I said started popping

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.912 align:middle line:90%
in place, one at a time.

01:10:00.912 --> 01:10:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I got to the point where I had
gone through a divorce years

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:03.730 align:middle line:90%
ago.

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:05.813 align:middle line:84%
And I got to a point I'm
ready for a relationship.

01:10:05.813 --> 01:10:09.348 align:middle line:84%
I wanted a person that can
come at least consciously

01:10:09.348 --> 01:10:11.140 align:middle line:84%
to my level, that can
understand me better,

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that I can understand better--
that all the years of things

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've done to build
myself up to this point,

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that I can actually utilize
and learn from my past mistakes

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:21.038 align:middle line:84%
and do it the right
way this time.

01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And I can find somebody
that would like to travel

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.040 align:middle line:90%
with me all over the world.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:24.998 align:middle line:90%
And I found my fiancee.

01:10:24.998 --> 01:10:26.500 align:middle line:90%
We just had to get on a plane.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And we've been together
now for a while.

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
We've never had an
argument, never had a fight,

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:32.115 align:middle line:90%
never had a disagreement.

01:10:32.115 --> 01:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
All right, so let
me change that.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
There's things that
we disagree on.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.970 align:middle line:90%
But we don't argue about them.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We have regular adult
conversations about them,

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
with no yelling, no attitudes,
no inflection of voice.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We just sit down and talk
like educated people,

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.152 align:middle line:90%
like smart people.

01:10:46.152 --> 01:10:47.110 align:middle line:90%
And we work things out.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
We figure out a
solution to a situation.

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Never had one argument yet.

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:52.600 align:middle line:90%
Travel all over the world.

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And our first conversation was
about black holes and quantum

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.440 align:middle line:90%
mechanics.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So just as I said a
year before I met her,

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.710 align:middle line:90%
it worked out that exact way.

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot more to
that, just even with some

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
of my businesses and financially
and things like that.

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I command
to come into my life--

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:12.878 align:middle line:84%
but knowledge is commanded
verbally and think about it.

01:11:12.878 --> 01:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But then, you've got to
put the action behind it.

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So now you've
commanded something.

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got to go
to the action part.

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:20.107 align:middle line:90%
So what's the action part?

01:11:20.107 --> 01:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have a
book that was going

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:24.232 align:middle line:84%
to sell and be very successful
to spread the word about Thoth

01:11:24.232 --> 01:11:25.065 align:middle line:90%
the Atlantean.

01:11:25.065 --> 01:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I did
was I spoke that out loud.

01:11:27.190 --> 01:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And after I spoke it out loud
and thought about and focused

01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:31.930 align:middle line:84%
on it for a while, I
began to write the book.

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Once I got the book done--
see, that's the action part,

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:35.320 align:middle line:90%
writing the book--

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.240 align:middle line:84%
then I had to market it
and put it out there.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have to follow up
your conscious thoughts

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and your verbal thoughts
with action behind them.

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:46.093 align:middle line:84%
You can't just sit back and go,
OK, give me a million dollars,

01:11:46.093 --> 01:11:47.843 align:middle line:84%
and then just sit back
and think, OK, it's

01:11:47.843 --> 01:11:49.150 align:middle line:90%
going to show up at my house.

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't really work that way.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:51.405 align:middle line:84%
You've got to put
action behind it.

01:11:51.405 --> 01:11:52.863 align:middle line:84%
If you're in a
business, and you're

01:11:52.863 --> 01:11:55.360 align:middle line:84%
trying to advance your
business to a specific level,

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.470 align:middle line:90%
then you need to sit down.

01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And you need to write down your
goals, short-term, medium-term,

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.077 align:middle line:90%
and long-term.

01:12:02.077 --> 01:12:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you need to
vocalize them out loud.

01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:05.682 align:middle line:84%
And after you vocalize
them out loud,

01:12:05.682 --> 01:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
then you need to go ahead
and put your plan of action

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.307 align:middle line:84%
in behind each one
of those goals.

01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And you need to put the
energy out there for that.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And once you do
that, then you're

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:15.757 align:middle line:84%
going to see everything
just fall right into place.

01:12:15.757 --> 01:12:16.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's an amazing thing.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.423 align:middle line:84%
So the Law of
Attraction is very real,

01:12:18.423 --> 01:12:19.910 align:middle line:90%
and it's very, very powerful.

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:21.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, without
you even realizing it,

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you can enact these
types of synchronicities

01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:26.470 align:middle line:90%
coming into your life.

01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be careful
because if you're doing it

01:12:28.900 --> 01:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in a negative way, if you're
talking negative and thinking

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:34.150 align:middle line:84%
negative, it works
the same way negative.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.470 align:middle line:90%
You can draw negative in.

01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:37.750 align:middle line:84%
If you're hanging around
a lot of negative people,

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:40.090 align:middle line:90%
get the heck away from them.

01:12:40.090 --> 01:12:41.582 align:middle line:90%
Get the heck away from them.

01:12:41.582 --> 01:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
I have family members
that I don't see anymore.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I love them, but I don't
go hang out with them.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:47.833 align:middle line:90%
I don't go see them.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll call them on the
phone, send them a text,

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:50.625 align:middle line:90%
send them a message--

01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:51.502 align:middle line:90%
Facebook Messenger.

01:12:51.502 --> 01:12:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Hey, what's-- you know?

01:12:52.460 --> 01:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going
to go put myself

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.790 align:middle line:90%
in a room full of dark energy.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.170 align:middle line:90%
And you shouldn't.

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And don't feel bad about it
or sorry about it or whatever.

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to live your
best life, period.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
If you can't focus on and
generate positive and stay

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:11.170 align:middle line:84%
around positive energy, how can
you be of service to others?

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, it doesn't
mean that you'd ever

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
going to going around
people that are dark and low

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.672 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes your job
is to bring those people up.

01:13:16.672 --> 01:13:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But people who are stuck
in a psychological concept

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.000 align:middle line:90%
or a matrix type of a mind--

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.928 align:middle line:90%
Agent Smith mind.

01:13:22.928 --> 01:13:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And they're really stuck there.

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
And you've worked on it.

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get
them out of it.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't put yourself
in that position.

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Don't put yourself
in those rooms

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.150 align:middle line:84%
with those people on
a consistent basis

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
because that dark energy
and that frequency they're

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
putting out is going to
come inside of your body.

01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
Your DNA is going to
absorb those frequencies.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:40.458 align:middle line:90%
And it's going to pull you down.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It even will change
your physical chemistry

01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:43.050 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%
This is scientifically proven.

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Going into a room around people
that are at low frequency,

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.470 align:middle line:84%
low vibration, dark
energy, and dark mindsets,

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:53.600 align:middle line:84%
will literally change the
physiology in your body.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.590 align:middle line:90%
This is scientific fact.

01:13:56.590 --> 01:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn how to
what I call "bend the matrix."

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
do every single day.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Every single day, I
wake up in the morning.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.840 align:middle line:90%
I stand up.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.040 align:middle line:90%
I do my stretches.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.880 align:middle line:90%
And I do that exact move.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I'm bending
the matrix around my body.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel that kind
of power inside of yourself.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to feel like you
really have these capabilities.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:20.748 align:middle line:84%
You can't just say,
oh, yeah, sounds great,

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and just keep on--
if you really want

01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:25.170 align:middle line:84%
to utilize a lot of these
laws, these mentalization laws

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.220 align:middle line:90%
of attraction.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And the power that you have
over your own reality tunnel,

01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
you've got to really
truly believe it.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this is one of
the things that I do.

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're living
in a matrix system.

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:36.447 align:middle line:84%
And we can't really,
unfortunately, completely

01:14:36.447 --> 01:14:39.010 align:middle line:84%
break out of the matrix system
because we're submerged inside

01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:40.260 align:middle line:90%
of a light matrix, number one.

01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Then, we're inside
of another matrix.

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
We're inside of the
governmental matrix.

01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
We're inside of the
institutional matrix.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We're inside of
the prison matrix.

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
All those are other
systematic matrixes--

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.910 align:middle line:90%
the capitalist society matrix--

01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:52.050 align:middle line:90%
that have been put on us.

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:53.633 align:middle line:84%
What you have to do,
you have to learn

01:14:53.633 --> 01:14:56.712 align:middle line:84%
how to maneuver
through these things.

01:14:56.712 --> 01:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn how to
maneuver through them.

01:14:58.670 --> 01:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand, yes,
you have to dabble in them

01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:02.497 align:middle line:84%
because this is where
we are, right now.

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
you have to know

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.080 align:middle line:90%
where you can pull back.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And you have to know
when you can bend them--

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:08.690 align:middle line:90%
when you can bend them.

01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:10.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I like to do.

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.492 align:middle line:90%
I like to bend the Matrix.

01:15:12.492 --> 01:15:13.950 align:middle line:10%
The Law of Attraction
in the matrix

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:16.367 align:middle line:10%
is "when you are in sync with
the universal consciousness.

01:15:16.367 --> 01:15:18.560 align:middle line:10%
And you warp or bend the matrix.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.110 align:middle line:10%
And the Law of Attraction
kicks in, allowing your needs

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:22.880 align:middle line:10%
and wants to fall toward you.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.440 align:middle line:10%
Simply put, the
Law of Attraction

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.430 align:middle line:10%
is the ability to
attract into our lives

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.070 align:middle line:10%
whatever we are focusing on.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:31.195 align:middle line:10%
It is believed that regardless
of age, nationality,

01:15:31.195 --> 01:15:34.190 align:middle line:10%
or religious belief, we are
all susceptible to the laws

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:35.870 align:middle line:10%
which govern the
universe, including

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:37.225 align:middle line:10%
the Law of Attraction.

01:15:37.225 --> 01:15:38.600 align:middle line:10%
It is the Law of
Attraction which

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.310 align:middle line:10%
uses the power of
the mind to translate

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:43.718 align:middle line:10%
whatever is in our thoughts and
materialize them into reality.

01:15:43.718 --> 01:15:46.010 align:middle line:10%
How do we get in sync with
the universal consciousness?

01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:48.650 align:middle line:10%
To do this, we must first raise
our vibration of our thoughts.

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.150 align:middle line:10%
In the third
dimension, the universe

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:52.910 align:middle line:10%
only responds to
high-frequency thoughts."

01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:53.910 align:middle line:90%
This is important stuff.

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:55.993 align:middle line:84%
This is what I've been
telling you the whole time.

01:15:55.993 --> 01:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time just
on principle number one

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.543 align:middle line:84%
because I think that's one of
the most powerful principles.

01:16:01.543 --> 01:16:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Because you really can't
advance any much further if

01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:07.220 align:middle line:84%
you have a weak mind, and a
weak mindset, and a dark mind.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:09.540 align:middle line:10%
You have to realize that.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
Thoughts create reality.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Second principle--
as above, so below.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
The Principle of
Correspondence--

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.530 align:middle line:90%
as above, so below.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.822 align:middle line:84%
This is another powerful
understanding we have to have,

01:16:18.822 --> 01:16:19.622 align:middle line:90%
here.

01:16:19.622 --> 01:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
In other words, everything
on the macro scale

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.150 align:middle line:90%
is the same on the micro scale.

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:27.157 align:middle line:84%
In other words, right now,
I have cells in my body.

01:16:27.157 --> 01:16:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And each one of those
cells in my body

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
can do everything that I can do.

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:33.575 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in my body can
do everything that I can do.

01:16:33.575 --> 01:16:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And then when you look at
a cell in the human body,

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:39.390 align:middle line:84%
you realize that cell
can be its own universe.

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.727 align:middle line:84%
So everything on
the smaller scale

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:42.810 align:middle line:90%
comes to the bigger scale.

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:44.268 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
talk about that.

01:16:44.268 --> 01:16:46.620 align:middle line:10%
For example, the solar
system ironically

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.950 align:middle line:10%
is a large-scale object
which resembles an atom that

01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:52.590 align:middle line:10%
has electrons orbiting it.

01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:54.060 align:middle line:10%
And just like in
the solar system,

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.550 align:middle line:10%
planets can switch
positions, especially

01:16:56.550 --> 01:17:00.390 align:middle line:10%
in the early formation stages,
an atom can do the same thing.

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And if an atom crashes
into another atom,

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:07.120 align:middle line:84%
energetically, the electrons can
jump from one orbit to another.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing how
as above, so below

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.475 align:middle line:84%
can happen on a classical scale
in the solar system-- something

01:17:12.475 --> 01:17:14.850 align:middle line:84%
as big as the solar system,
all the way down to something

01:17:14.850 --> 01:17:17.040 align:middle line:90%
as microscopic as an atom.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.910 align:middle line:84%
This is a video I
played yesterday,

01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:23.800 align:middle line:84%
giving just a fundamental
example of as above, so below.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.600 align:middle line:10%
You see?

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:28.400 align:middle line:10%
This is you with the sperm
in the top corner, which

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.390 align:middle line:10%
is competing, obviously,
to get to the egg

01:17:30.390 --> 01:17:32.790 align:middle line:10%
and then entering your body.

01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:36.217 align:middle line:10%
On the other side at the top
corner, you see the sperm.

01:17:36.217 --> 01:17:37.800 align:middle line:10%
They're going to get
to this egg, now.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.730 align:middle line:10%
And they've got to battle.

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:39.780 align:middle line:10%
One of them has to win.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.113 align:middle line:10%
So somebody's got to get inside.

01:17:41.113 --> 01:17:44.460 align:middle line:90%


01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.470 align:middle line:10%
And the frequency
that carries sperm

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:49.020 align:middle line:10%
is the male frequency
energy in the universe.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.112 align:middle line:10%
But the frequency that carries
creation is the female energy.

01:17:52.112 --> 01:17:54.570 align:middle line:10%
And we may have a chance to go
over that a little bit today

01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:55.690 align:middle line:10%
as well.

01:17:55.690 --> 01:18:00.180 align:middle line:10%
Then you see in the lower-left
corner, this is you,

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:07.180 align:middle line:10%
where you have a brain
and a spinal cord,

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:11.028 align:middle line:10%
which ironically resemble a
sperm and the sperm's tail.

01:18:11.028 --> 01:18:13.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's not the sperm and
the sperm's tail growing up

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.870 align:middle line:10%
to be a brain and a spinal cord.

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:18.240 align:middle line:10%
But it's an archetype.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.410 align:middle line:10%
It shows you as above, so below.

01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:21.868 align:middle line:10%
We start off as a
tiny spermatozoa.

01:18:21.868 --> 01:18:23.327 align:middle line:10%
And the next thing
you know, you've

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:24.958 align:middle line:10%
got a brain and a
spinal cord, which

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:26.250 align:middle line:10%
ironically resemble each other.

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:28.500 align:middle line:10%
On the other side,
you have everything

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
around the body is
just to preserve

01:18:31.410 --> 01:18:34.400 align:middle line:10%
the brain and that spinal
cord, which represent the thing

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that it started out as first,
which was a spermatozoa.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.940 align:middle line:10%
So it's very
interesting to see it

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.950 align:middle line:10%
from that perspective to get a
good understanding of as above,

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.590 align:middle line:10%
so below.

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:44.550 align:middle line:10%
This meme says, "Hello.

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:45.820 align:middle line:10%
I am the universe.

01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.650 align:middle line:10%
And it is a pleasure for
you to meet yourself."

01:18:48.650 --> 01:18:50.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a meme I made a
long time ago because you

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.483 align:middle line:84%
have to understand that
you are the universe

01:18:52.483 --> 01:18:53.580 align:middle line:90%
and the universe is you.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
Every planet, every moon, every
stellar nursery, every nebula,

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
every grain of sand in the
entire universe is you.

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%
And you are it.

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And when you
understand that, we're

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:middle line:90%
all part of one main thing.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And like I was talking
about yesterday,

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
the human brain is
encased in darkness.

01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It can't see, smell,
touch, or feel anything.

01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:18.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even know that
anything even exists.

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:19.260 align:middle line:90%
But it has friends.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.037 align:middle line:90%
So it says to its friends--

01:19:21.037 --> 01:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
sight, hearing, smelling,
feeling, touch, and everything

01:19:23.370 --> 01:19:24.240 align:middle line:90%
else--

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:24.820 align:middle line:90%
hey, friends.

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I need you guys to go out there
and collect some information.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Go out there and tell
me what's going on.

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:29.045 align:middle line:90%
Those friends go out.

01:19:29.045 --> 01:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But they themselves can't
decipher the information.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.267 align:middle line:90%
They can only collect the data.

01:19:33.267 --> 01:19:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So they go out and
collect data and bring it

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
back to the brain, which is
encased in total darkness.

01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
When they bring it
back to the brain,

01:19:39.610 --> 01:19:41.808 align:middle line:84%
the brain then sorts
it all out and projects

01:19:41.808 --> 01:19:44.100 align:middle line:84%
a hologram that says this is
what's going on out there.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And you navigate through this
third dimension, based off

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
of projected holograms.

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.077 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
navigate this world.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not because you
opened your eyes,

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and you can see that
there's a road and a path,

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.720 align:middle line:90%
and you're walking down it.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.550 align:middle line:90%
It goes way deeper than that.

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And everything you see
in the third dimension,

01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.910 align:middle line:90%
you see in the past.

01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
You see nothing in the
current present moment.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.530 align:middle line:84%
As I'm looking at
this gentleman here,

01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:09.010 align:middle line:84%
the light photon is bouncing off
of him and coming into my eye.

01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:10.980 align:middle line:90%
There's a time frame for that.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:13.320 align:middle line:84%
That time frame is
probably a Planck unit.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.695 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's got to
get into my eye.

01:20:14.695 --> 01:20:16.487 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to go to
the back of my brain.

01:20:16.487 --> 01:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And my brain has to
decipher that data.

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It happens in a very,
very quick amount of time.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I recognize
that I've seen him,

01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
he's already moved into
a different position.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:26.250 align:middle line:90%
You see?

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So you don't see anything
in the current moment.

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything you see
is in the past.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Third principle-- the
Principle of Vibration.

01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:33.570 align:middle line:90%
Everything moves.

01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything vibrates-- what
we're talking about now.

01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.075 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
you can never tell

01:20:37.075 --> 01:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the location and vibration
of a spin of an atom

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.172 align:middle line:90%
at the same time--

01:20:40.172 --> 01:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
this is great for
encryption technology--

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:45.360 align:middle line:84%
is because once you bounce a
photon off of it to look at it,

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
you change the spin
or the momentum.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.300 align:middle line:90%
You see?

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you can never
tell both at the same time.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.085 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a frequency.

01:20:53.085 --> 01:20:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Everything has a vibration.

01:20:54.210 --> 01:20:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Everything moves.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Nothing stands still.

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
To get to absolute zero is
virtually almost impossible

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
because at the subatomic level,
everything is still vibrating.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's very hard to get objects
to reach complete, total zero--

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.195 align:middle line:90%
absolute zero.

01:21:09.195 --> 01:21:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So now that we know that
everything vibrates,

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:11.650 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:13.108 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at string theory,

01:21:13.108 --> 01:21:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you find out that
according to string theory,

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
there are these gigantic,
vibrating strings--

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.560 align:middle line:84%
subatomic strings,
but they're very big--

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.050 align:middle line:84%
vibrating and emanating
these frequencies.

01:21:22.050 --> 01:21:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And out of these frequencies--

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:25.110 align:middle line:84%
these vibrating
strings, by the way,

01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:26.595 align:middle line:90%
are inside the flower of life.

01:21:26.595 --> 01:21:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So they're coming
through something out

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:31.720 align:middle line:84%
of the flower of life called
the vesica piscis, which I'm

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
going to show you in a minute.

01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:34.635 align:middle line:84%
As these energies,
these vibrations,

01:21:34.635 --> 01:21:36.510 align:middle line:84%
come through the vesica
piscis, out into what

01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:39.240 align:middle line:84%
we call our universe,
they bring with them

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.760 align:middle line:84%
everything needed
to create matter.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, they start off as
electromagnetic waves

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
until a conscious observer looks
at it-- looks at these waves

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or observes these waves or
interacts with these waves.

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we collapse
those waves into matter--

01:21:52.890 --> 01:21:54.640 align:middle line:90%
to the illusion of matter.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this podium
doesn't even exist, right here.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, an atom is 99.9%
even more than that empty space.

01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:04.620 align:middle line:90%
So this shouldn't even be here.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.680 align:middle line:90%
What is here?

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
What gives us this
field of solidity?

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.240 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, the
only thing stopping my hand

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.570 align:middle line:84%
from passing through
this podium is

01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:15.780 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic repulsion
of the electrons in my hand

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
and the electrons
that are rotating

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.070 align:middle line:90%
on the atoms inside this podium.

01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I can phase shift
the atomic frequency

01:22:23.130 --> 01:22:25.200 align:middle line:84%
of the atoms in my
hand, I can pass my hand

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.492 align:middle line:84%
directly through this podium
like it wasn't even there,

01:22:27.492 --> 01:22:30.172 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it right back out
with no effect or any injury.

01:22:30.172 --> 01:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that more advanced beings

01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:33.990 align:middle line:90%
have the capability of doing.

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, people think they're
seeing wraiths or ghosts.

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They could be seeing
people that are coming

01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:41.850 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions
or have the capability

01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:44.910 align:middle line:84%
of using cloaking technology
and walking through things,

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
like people talk about all the
time in some of these contact

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:50.098 align:middle line:90%
situations.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, you know, things
aren't as far-fetched

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.765 align:middle line:84%
as they seem until
we really understand

01:22:53.765 --> 01:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
the physics behind them.

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And they become more realistic
and understandable as being

01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
technology and understanding
of how the world works,

01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
or how the universe
works, versus

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.947 align:middle line:90%
something ambiguous as a ghost.

01:23:03.947 --> 01:23:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying they don't exist.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm saying
is it's very possible

01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to mimic something very
similar to that by just knowing

01:23:10.230 --> 01:23:12.400 align:middle line:90%
what to do and how to do it.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:16.110 align:middle line:84%
So here is a somatic
demonstration and also

01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
a the orbit of the
Earth around the sun.

01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:23.218 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the
pattern that it makes.

01:23:23.218 --> 01:23:25.260 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see here in
the upper-left corner cell

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.930 align:middle line:10%
division, where we were
talking about earlier how

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:32.111 align:middle line:10%
we have a very good scale
of as above, so below.

01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:33.584 align:middle line:10%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:23:33.584 --> 01:23:35.057 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:53.715 align:middle line:90%


01:23:53.715 --> 01:23:55.600 align:middle line:10%
These patterns are
all self-similar and

01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:56.820 align:middle line:10%
self-recurring.

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:00.160 align:middle line:10%
If you look at the audio
levitation of the droplets,

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.680 align:middle line:10%
you see that they create
this pattern here,

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.070 align:middle line:10%
which resembles
Metatron's Cube, which

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:07.840 align:middle line:10%
is a four-dimensional
cube that was most

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.910 align:middle line:10%
likely an Ark of the Covenant.

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:12.700 align:middle line:10%
It has many other
technological uses as well.

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And inside this
pattern as well, you

01:24:14.410 --> 01:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
can also see something called
a vector equilibrium, which

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:20.350 align:middle line:84%
gives us access to unlimited
power, unlimited energy

01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:21.640 align:middle line:90%
sources.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And the ancients
knew all about this.

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:25.647 align:middle line:84%
So we're just starting to
rediscover these things

01:24:25.647 --> 01:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
through frequency and vibration.

01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:28.563 align:middle line:84%
Frequency and vibration
are the reason

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.280 align:middle line:84%
why a leopard has
spots, why a turtle has

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.743 align:middle line:90%
that pattern on its back.

01:24:31.743 --> 01:24:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything
you could think

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.535 align:middle line:84%
of in this entire
third dimension

01:24:34.535 --> 01:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is because of frequency
and vibration-- frequencies

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and vibrations that you
can't necessarily hear.

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't forget, our human
hearing is very, very weak.

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
That's why if you buy a dog
whistle, a dog can hear it.

01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:45.700 align:middle line:90%
But you can't hear the whistle.

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Even our visual
capabilities are very--

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
we have a very small
capability, visually.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you could
see everything that

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.055 align:middle line:84%
was going on around
here-- if you

01:24:52.055 --> 01:24:53.480 align:middle line:84%
had 100% visual
capability-- you'd

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.160 align:middle line:90%
probably freak out right now.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:55.960 align:middle line:90%
OK?

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.043 align:middle line:84%
You'd probably freak out
and run out of this room.

01:24:58.043 --> 01:25:00.195 align:middle line:84%
So we have a very
limited perception.

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And with that
limited perception,

01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to
perceive things that

01:25:03.130 --> 01:25:07.620 align:middle line:84%
are way beyond our mental
capabilities at this moment.

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a famous
cylinder seal from Sumeria.

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This cylinder
seal, I believe, is

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:18.730 align:middle line:84%
on display at the British
Museum in England.

01:25:18.730 --> 01:25:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
fuzzy, obviously.

01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But you see the king, or
the god, sitting down.

01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's very big because he's
much taller than the men that

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.010 align:middle line:90%
are to the left--

01:25:30.010 --> 01:25:31.183 align:middle line:90%
these three men, there.

01:25:31.183 --> 01:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you were able to
see it a lot clearer--

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.690 align:middle line:84%
I know some of you
are kind of far away.

01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:36.482 align:middle line:84%
But these three men--
there's one man who's

01:25:36.482 --> 01:25:39.160 align:middle line:90%
got his hand on this table.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And he's lifting the
table with one hand.

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a stone table.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.380 align:middle line:84%
Above that table,
there's a disc.

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.060 align:middle line:84%
That disc is not
sitting on the table.

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
That disc is a frequency
that's emanating

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.430 align:middle line:90%
from that object above it--

01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:54.185 align:middle line:84%
that arm that's kind of
reaching over the god.

01:25:54.185 --> 01:25:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
lines coming down.

01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's showing
you that there's

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.950 align:middle line:84%
a frequency coming out of this
box at the top of that arm--

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:04.143 align:middle line:90%
that device.

01:26:04.143 --> 01:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to the
one that Edward Leedskalnin

01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
has at the Coral Castle
in Miami, Florida, which

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I visited when he built that
megalithic structure in Miami.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
He used the same
exact technique.

01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:16.033 align:middle line:84%
So this box, or this
device at the top, his arm

01:26:16.033 --> 01:26:17.200 align:middle line:90%
is kind of hovering over it.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.060 align:middle line:90%
It's emanating this frequency.

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
This frequency is
allowing this average man

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
to lift this stone
table with one hand.

01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
He's teaching human beings
how frequencies and vibration

01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:31.030 align:middle line:90%
can create anti-gravity.

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:33.890 align:middle line:84%
This tablet is about
7,000 years old.

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:38.500 align:middle line:84%
7,000 years ago, people with
much more advanced knowledge

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
were teaching human beings
about anti-gravity technology.

01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very,
very famous seal.

01:26:44.710 --> 01:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at it,
analyzed it, broke it down.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I realized this
was technology at work.

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:53.050 align:middle line:10%
So again, everything
operates off

01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:55.915 align:middle line:10%
of frequencies and vibrations.

01:26:55.915 --> 01:26:57.040 align:middle line:10%
The Principle of Polarity--

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:57.873 align:middle line:10%
"Everything is dual.

01:26:57.873 --> 01:26:59.230 align:middle line:10%
Everything has poles.

01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Everything has its
pair of opposites.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.190 align:middle line:10%
Like and unlike are the same.

01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:04.780 align:middle line:10%
Opposites are
identical in nature,

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:07.390 align:middle line:10%
but different in degree."

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.970 align:middle line:84%
This is important that
you understand this.

01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:12.700 align:middle line:90%
"Like and unlike are the same.

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Opposites are
identical in nature,

01:27:14.650 --> 01:27:16.910 align:middle line:90%
but different in degree.

01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:17.710 align:middle line:10%
Extremes meet.

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:19.810 align:middle line:10%
All truths are but half-truths.

01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:22.730 align:middle line:10%
All paradoxes may
be reconciled."

01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So we'll take, for example,
something as simple

01:27:25.150 --> 01:27:29.870 align:middle line:90%
as the temperature of atoms.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that this was a
jar of water, for example.

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom part
of the water was hot.

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the top half of
the water was cold.

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:38.530 align:middle line:90%
It's still water.

01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:40.330 align:middle line:90%
And it'd still be H2O.

01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:43.030 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is the temperature.

01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is important for people
to understand that everything

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.930 align:middle line:90%
flows in and out.

01:27:46.930 --> 01:27:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Everything has ties.

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
rise and a fall.

01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything has a
yin and a yang--

01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.750 align:middle line:90%
positive and negative.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.060 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
good without evil.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.560 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
evil without good.

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just part of the
balance of the universe.

01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:01.480 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And once you really
understand that,

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.460 align:middle line:84%
you start to see things
a lot differently.

01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you're interacting
with a person,

01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
for example, how can you
apply this to your life?

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.262 align:middle line:84%
If you're interacting
with the person

01:28:09.262 --> 01:28:11.855 align:middle line:84%
that disappointed you
for whatever reason.

01:28:11.855 --> 01:28:14.230 align:middle line:84%
You thought this person was
going to do something for you

01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:16.020 align:middle line:90%
and take care of a situation.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.830 align:middle line:90%
And it didn't work out that way.

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Don't be disappointed
at the person.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Be disappointed at yourself
because you had an expectation

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:25.000 align:middle line:90%
from that person.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.870 align:middle line:84%
See, when you become a better
judge of people and drop

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:32.560 align:middle line:84%
expectations, then you're
more likely to not get

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.533 align:middle line:90%
yourself hurt.

01:28:33.533 --> 01:28:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other words, if you
tell somebody to do something,

01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
but if they don't get it done,
don't have an expectation

01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that they will get it done
because that person may

01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.110 align:middle line:90%
fail you.

01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:43.090 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way life is.

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way life is.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.272 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that's
just the way life is.

01:28:46.272 --> 01:28:48.048 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a
very rare example.

01:28:48.048 --> 01:28:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Some people get really
down because they've

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:52.465 align:middle line:10%
been disappointed by other
people over and over again,

01:28:52.465 --> 01:28:54.340 align:middle line:10%
not realizing it may be
some of the decisions

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.230 align:middle line:10%
that they're making
in who they're picking

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:59.170 align:middle line:10%
to enact out or act out these
particular things that they're

01:28:59.170 --> 01:29:01.600 align:middle line:10%
looking to get done.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.980 align:middle line:10%
The Principle of Rhythm--

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:04.540 align:middle line:10%
"Everything flows out and in.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:05.980 align:middle line:10%
Everything has tides."

01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Everything rises and falls,
like I was talking about before.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.570 align:middle line:10%
"The pendulum swing
manifests in everything.

01:29:10.570 --> 01:29:12.563 align:middle line:10%
The measure of the
swing to the right

01:29:12.563 --> 01:29:14.230 align:middle line:10%
is the measure of the
swing to the left.

01:29:14.230 --> 01:29:16.240 align:middle line:10%
Rhythm compensates."

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a
video here I'm going

01:29:17.890 --> 01:29:21.580 align:middle line:84%
to show that shows a swinging
motion, and an object

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.460 align:middle line:84%
in the way, and how the swinging
motion moves this object.

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And we have to imagine us as
a conscious movement coming

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:33.130 align:middle line:84%
together to become one
and to work together

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:36.430 align:middle line:84%
to overthrow the 1% that
are running and controlling

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:37.450 align:middle line:90%
this planet.

01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
We have 7.5 billion people on
this planet being run by 1%.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Basically, really 13 families,
just a little over 100 people,

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.820 align:middle line:84%
control everything--
literally control everything.

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Shame on us.

01:29:50.930 --> 01:29:54.120 align:middle line:84%
It's our fault. It's not
their fault. It's our fault.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.880 align:middle line:90%
It's our fault for all the wars.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.620 align:middle line:84%
It's our fault for
all the destruction.

01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Is our fault for
all the slavery.

01:29:59.070 --> 01:30:01.640 align:middle line:84%
It's our fault all
the political systems

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that are in place and all the
demonic activity going on.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.060 align:middle line:90%
It's our fault.

01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's
7.5 billion of us,

01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and we can't get along with the
person sitting right next to us

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:14.180 align:middle line:84%
enough to have a
decent conversation.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And if 7.5 million people
got together all in unison,

01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:19.740 align:middle line:84%
all in one accord, all
on the same frequency,

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:22.240 align:middle line:84%
there's no way 100 people could
then run or control and tell

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.700 align:middle line:84%
us what to do and inject
poisons into our baby

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and feed us poisons
at the grocery store

01:30:26.890 --> 01:30:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and make us pay these
fake taxes and make us pay

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
these fake mortgages on fake
money that doesn't exist,

01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:34.530 align:middle line:84%
and all this other crazy stuff
that we're allowing to happen.

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And just literally
work us to death--

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.710 align:middle line:84%
work us so hard that all we
can think about is retirement.

01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And by the time we
get to retirement,

01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
we can't even take
the retirement money

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and go anywhere because
we got diseases, now.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:46.390 align:middle line:90%
And we can't even travel.

01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:47.430 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Because why?

01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
We have no unison.

01:30:49.230 --> 01:30:50.313 align:middle line:90%
We have no pendulum swing.

01:30:50.313 --> 01:30:51.780 align:middle line:84%
We're not swinging
like a pendulum.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not moving in unison to
move the object out of the way.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.220 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
is we're literally

01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.500 align:middle line:84%
focusing on conquer
and divide tactics

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and actually allowing
it to happen.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we're also focused on
all the distraction tactics.

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.290 align:middle line:90%
I got to pay my mortgage.

01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
If I don't do that, if I
don't go to work to do this,

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:06.860 align:middle line:90%
if I don't--

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I've got to take care
of this situation.

01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I got to go to work over here.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.660 align:middle line:90%
I got to pay these taxes.

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:15.390 align:middle line:84%
I've got to-- it's just
we're in a rat race.

01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.590 align:middle line:90%
We're in a rat race.

01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And we let that distract
us from loving one another,

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:22.460 align:middle line:84%
from talking to people,
from even saying hi

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:25.210 align:middle line:84%
when we walk past
somebody on the street.

01:31:25.210 --> 01:31:28.402 align:middle line:84%
We're so distracted and so
distraught and torn apart,

01:31:28.402 --> 01:31:30.360 align:middle line:84%
we don't realize all the
powers in the people--

all the powers in unity.

01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:33.930 align:middle line:84%
There's more power in
unity than division.

01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:34.960 align:middle line:90%
They keep us divided.

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.290 align:middle line:84%
They've been keeping us
divided since ancient times.

01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you how far back this
goes to a good record of it.

01:31:40.150 --> 01:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
Sumerian tablets,

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.822 align:middle line:84%
you find out about
a situation called

01:31:42.822 --> 01:31:44.887 align:middle line:90%
the Tower of Babel incident.

01:31:44.887 --> 01:31:46.470 align:middle line:84%
When you look in the
modern-day Bible,

01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:47.762 align:middle line:90%
you look at the same incidents.

01:31:47.762 --> 01:31:50.246 align:middle line:84%
In the modern-day Bible,
the Tower of Babel--

01:31:50.246 --> 01:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh, who's really Enlil
from the Sumerian tablets,

01:31:52.890 --> 01:31:54.180 align:middle line:90%
he came back after being away.

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, what God goes away
and comes back and doesn't

01:31:57.090 --> 01:31:58.110 align:middle line:90%
know what's going on?

01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, this wasn't
a god, a real god,

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:01.310 align:middle line:90%
a creator of the universe god.

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:02.970 align:middle line:84%
This was a person
that was advanced,

01:32:02.970 --> 01:32:05.005 align:middle line:84%
who went away and came
back and was shocked.

01:32:05.005 --> 01:32:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if the
creator of universe

01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:08.280 align:middle line:84%
is going to be shocked
by anything because he's

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:09.600 align:middle line:90%
going to know everything.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.710 align:middle line:90%
So this isn't a real god.

01:32:10.710 --> 01:32:12.355 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to make
this point to you.

01:32:12.355 --> 01:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
In the Sumerian tablets,
it's not a real god.

01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:15.397 align:middle line:90%
It's an and Anunnaki person.

01:32:15.397 --> 01:32:17.588 align:middle line:84%
This is a person of advanced
knowledge and wisdom.

01:32:17.588 --> 01:32:18.630 align:middle line:90%
Goes away and comes back.

01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Human beings are building this
tower-- tower in the space--

01:32:22.110 --> 01:32:24.237 align:middle line:84%
mimicking something that
they saw the Anunnaki do.

01:32:24.237 --> 01:32:26.070 align:middle line:84%
He's shocked by this
because at that moment,

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:28.980 align:middle line:84%
he realizes human beings
have the capability of not

01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
only being just as good as the
Anunnaki in terms of technology

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and working together, maybe
even can surpass them.

01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And because we outnumber them,
this had to come to an end

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.038 align:middle line:90%
immediately.

01:32:38.038 --> 01:32:39.330 align:middle line:90%
So what did he do in the Bible?

01:32:39.330 --> 01:32:40.872 align:middle line:84%
The same thing he
did in the tablets.

01:32:40.872 --> 01:32:42.690 align:middle line:90%
He destroyed the Tower of Babel.

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he goes
and takes the people

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
that were working together
in unison, all as one, all

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.790 align:middle line:84%
in love with one another
on a common goal,

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%
and rips them apart.

01:32:52.530 --> 01:32:55.085 align:middle line:84%
Then he changes their
languages, sends them

01:32:55.085 --> 01:32:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to different parts
of the planet.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And he says, "My seed shall
not abide a man forever.

01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:02.232 align:middle line:84%
His years shall be
numbered to 120."

01:33:02.232 --> 01:33:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, guess what they just
found out at Harvard University?

01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:06.610 align:middle line:84%
A human being can
live to 120 years

01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:08.610 align:middle line:84%
under the most pristine
conditions because

01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of a fusion of
chromosome number 2

01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:12.457 align:middle line:84%
that happened
thousands of years ago.

01:33:12.457 --> 01:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
They can't figure
out how it happened.

01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:15.582 align:middle line:84%
But it had to happen
in a laboratory,

01:33:15.582 --> 01:33:18.420 align:middle line:84%
they're saying, because this
can't happen through evolution.

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:20.220 align:middle line:84%
So at some point in
the distant past--

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:21.870 align:middle line:84%
we already know
who it was, Enlil.

01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:24.570 align:middle line:84%
He ordered a genetic
modification on human beings

01:33:24.570 --> 01:33:27.090 align:middle line:84%
to fuse chromosome number
2 and put a telomere cap

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:29.095 align:middle line:84%
on one end and a telomere
cap on the other end.

01:33:29.095 --> 01:33:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And that telomere cap has
something called genetic buffer

01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:32.310 align:middle line:90%
material.

01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And in this genetic
buffer material,

01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:35.910 align:middle line:90%
scientists discovered what?

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Every time your cells and
DNA replicate, the buffer

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.290 align:middle line:84%
gets smaller and
smaller and smaller.

01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:42.270 align:middle line:84%
When the buffer caps
are out of material,

01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
your body begins
the death process.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's how you die.

01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, what they've
done at Harvard

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
is they discovered how to stop
the telomeres from shrinking

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.800 align:middle line:90%
in mice.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:54.450 align:middle line:84%
In mice, they have
created a situation

01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.533 align:middle line:84%
where these mice live three
times longer than they

01:33:56.533 --> 01:33:59.280 align:middle line:84%
should have, which means they
can do it to human beings.

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.530 align:middle line:84%
But guess what's going to
happen if we don't take back

01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:02.580 align:middle line:90%
control of this planet?

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%

selling you time.

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.185 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
a small example.

01:37:07.185 --> 01:37:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we take all of the
money out of the Rothschild

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:12.620 align:middle line:84%
banks and say we're
done with you guys.

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:14.223 align:middle line:84%
We're not operating
with you anymore.

01:37:14.223 --> 01:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
We're not operating
with you, Mr. Taxman

01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:19.190 align:middle line:84%
because 100% of your
income tax goes directly

01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:21.560 align:middle line:84%
towards the Rothschild-owned
central bank

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.240 align:middle line:84%
interest on fake
money that never

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.342 align:middle line:90%
existed in the first place.

01:37:25.342 --> 01:37:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Not one penny of your income
tax goes to the US government.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Not one penny.

01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:32.718 align:middle line:84%
This is our fault.
We're the ones

01:37:32.718 --> 01:37:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that are responsible for
allowing this to happen.

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.608 align:middle line:84%
We're in full collusion
through our silence.

01:37:39.608 --> 01:37:40.900 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about the Yugas.

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:42.580 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about cycles.

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:45.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I was talking
about is there's

01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:46.810 align:middle line:90%
cycles of rise and fall.

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:49.660 align:middle line:10%
They're called the
Yuga cycles in India.

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.160 align:middle line:10%
And I love these
because you can see

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:54.850 align:middle line:10%
right now that we're in the
Silver Age, the Treta-Yuga.

01:37:54.850 --> 01:37:57.460 align:middle line:10%
We're at the beginning of the
Silver Age on the left side,

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.990 align:middle line:10%
actually.

01:37:58.990 --> 01:38:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're the pioneers of
the Conscious Movement.

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:03.400 align:middle line:90%
We're the pioneers.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We're moving back
into the Golden Age.

01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:07.983 align:middle line:10%
We're not on the other
side of the Treta-Yuga,

01:38:07.983 --> 01:38:09.400 align:middle line:10%
where we're going
into the bronze.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.270 align:middle line:10%
We're actually on
the side that's

01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:11.770 align:middle line:10%
headed back up
towards the golden.

01:38:11.770 --> 01:38:13.780 align:middle line:10%
These are very, very
long cycles that

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:17.860 align:middle line:10%
go on for 15,000, 20,000,
30,000 years each.

01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.360 align:middle line:90%
They're very, very long cycles.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're at the beginning
of the Silver, which

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.527 align:middle line:84%
means probably to get
to the Golden Age,

01:38:22.527 --> 01:38:25.660 align:middle line:84%
we're still looking at probably
7,000 to 8,000 years from now.

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean
that things aren't

01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:28.360 align:middle line:84%
going to get a lot
better on this planet.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.340 align:middle line:84%
As people become more
conscious, as people

01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:33.352 align:middle line:84%
become more aware of
what's going on, just

01:38:33.352 --> 01:38:34.810 align:middle line:84%
within a very short
period of time,

01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:35.920 align:middle line:84%
you're going to see
a lot of changes.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Look where we came
from from 100 years ago

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.010 align:middle line:84%
to now, from the horse, buggy,
and carriage to space travel.

01:38:42.010 --> 01:38:43.600 align:middle line:90%
We have the capability.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:44.980 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of us.

01:38:44.980 --> 01:38:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Within the next 30 years to 40
years, if you're still alive,

01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
you may be able to extend your
life another 50 to 100 years

01:38:51.610 --> 01:38:54.130 align:middle line:84%
just on stem cells because
of stem cell research-- using

01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:56.695 align:middle line:84%
your own stem cells, not
dead embryos, because they

01:38:56.695 --> 01:38:58.195 align:middle line:84%
can take a skin
cell from your body,

01:38:58.195 --> 01:39:00.550 align:middle line:84%
now, and turn that skin
cell into a stem cell,

01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:03.100 align:middle line:84%
re-inject it into your
body, and cure Alzheimer's

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and many other
illnesses and diseases.

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.640 align:middle line:90%
This is already being done.

01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're at an age now
where we can go one way--

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:12.367 align:middle line:84%
one reality tunnel, one
path-- or the other.

01:39:12.367 --> 01:39:14.950 align:middle line:84%
But this is why we have to keep
putting information out there.

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:16.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got to wake
up a lot of people.

01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:17.230 align:middle line:84%
We've got to make
them conscious.

01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:18.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to make them
understand these principles.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get them to the
point where they understand,

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:22.870 align:middle line:84%
so we can continue to head
up towards this Golden

01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:25.653 align:middle line:90%
Age in a swift movement.

01:39:25.653 --> 01:39:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like to see this
time, to be honest with you,

01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:30.150 align:middle line:90%
we've done this before.

01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:32.680 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans say we've
done this four times.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.805 align:middle line:84%
And we're headed
into the fifth world.

01:39:35.805 --> 01:39:37.180 align:middle line:84%
This is not
something that's new.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:38.638 align:middle line:84%
The Indians believe
the same thing.

01:39:38.638 --> 01:39:41.020 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's gone on for eons.

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.330 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to break this cycle.

01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Why does it have to be a circle?

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we get to the point
where we maintain a Golden Age?

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Has anybody ever probably
thought about that?

01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Like these ancient
sages and so forth?

01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:53.590 align:middle line:90%
This was a cycle.

01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:55.090 align:middle line:90%
It's always a cycle.

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:57.743 align:middle line:84%
Well, why can't we
break this time loop?

01:39:57.743 --> 01:39:58.660 align:middle line:90%
It's time to break it.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's time to stay
in the Golden Age.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.960 align:middle line:84%
When we get there, we
need to stay there.

01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.627 align:middle line:84%
So these are some of
the goals that I've

01:40:03.627 --> 01:40:07.240 align:middle line:84%
set forth to be able to put
out there into the universe.

01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.290 align:middle line:84%
I may not be around to
see these things occur.

01:40:09.290 --> 01:40:12.730 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to drop
the seeds and see

01:40:12.730 --> 01:40:14.198 align:middle line:90%
if we can manifest them.

01:40:14.198 --> 01:40:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, well,
what do you do for a living?

01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:17.907 align:middle line:84%
Well, I alter our
future realities

01:40:17.907 --> 01:40:20.020 align:middle line:90%
in the third dimension.

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.612 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

01:40:22.612 --> 01:40:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
Sixth Principle--

01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:26.320 align:middle line:84%
the Principle of
Cause and Effect.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.530 align:middle line:84%
"Every cause has its effect,
and every effect has its cause.

01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens
according to law.

01:40:31.180 --> 01:40:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Chance is but a name for a
law that's not recognized.

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:36.130 align:middle line:84%
There are many
planes of causation,

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:38.176 align:middle line:90%
but nothing escapes the law."

01:40:38.176 --> 01:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is every action has an
equal and opposite reaction.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Every decision
has a consequence.

01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So literally every
single decision

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.950 align:middle line:84%
you make, whether it's
a good consequence

01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
or a bad consequence,
what Thoth is saying

01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:55.550 align:middle line:84%
is everything is going
to have a consequence.

01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So it could be
something as simple

01:40:57.130 --> 01:40:59.950 align:middle line:84%
as, OK, I just want
to leave this lecture

01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.035 align:middle line:90%
and walk out the door.

01:41:01.035 --> 01:41:02.410 align:middle line:84%
If I walk out the
door right now,

01:41:02.410 --> 01:41:03.340 align:middle line:84%
you guys are going to be
sitting there, going what

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:04.340 align:middle line:90%
in the heck's happening?

01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:06.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to go
see Billy Carson again.

01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:09.850 align:middle line:84%
That would be the consequence,
just to give you an example.

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Or the other decision
I can make is

01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:13.500 align:middle line:84%
to stay here, do my
full presentation,

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and tell you guys thank
you for coming out

01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:16.655 align:middle line:90%
and give you a hug and a kiss.

01:41:16.655 --> 01:41:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And you walk out and
go, man, that was great.

01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to come back
and see some more.

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:20.880 align:middle line:90%
See?

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.812 align:middle line:84%
So every decision you
make has a consequence.

01:41:22.812 --> 01:41:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And this goes for
everything-- everything

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.830 align:middle line:84%
from even eating food
to going to school

01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:29.415 align:middle line:84%
to talking to your kids
to wherever you do.

01:41:29.415 --> 01:41:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
that we understand this.

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of times,
we disconnect consequence

01:41:35.410 --> 01:41:37.660 align:middle line:90%
from the decision.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
We make decisions
without thinking

01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:41.140 align:middle line:90%
about the consequences.

01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is we
get ourselves in trouble.

01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.920 align:middle line:90%
This happens all the time.

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it literally
happens all the time.

01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I have now
started try to do myself,

01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:51.160 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just as
guilty as everybody else,

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.452 align:middle line:84%
is I started when I'm getting
ready to make a decision,

01:41:53.452 --> 01:41:55.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm not rushing anymore.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.260 align:middle line:90%
I stop.

01:41:56.260 --> 01:41:57.350 align:middle line:90%
And I think.

01:41:57.350 --> 01:42:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, if there's a
lot of potential consequences,

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I write down the
consequences I think

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.520 align:middle line:90%
could occur from this decision.

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I analyze
those consequences.

01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And based on those
consequences and percentages

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.570 align:middle line:84%
of those things
happening, then I

01:42:10.570 --> 01:42:13.290 align:middle line:84%
move forward with my decision,
one way or the other.

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we all did that--
took the time to do that--

01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:17.282 align:middle line:84%
and stopped racing,
racing, racing, racing,

01:42:17.282 --> 01:42:19.750 align:middle line:84%
racing all the time, making
split-second decisions,

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:21.820 align:middle line:84%
we'd probably end up
having a better life

01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and having a better
life for our families.

01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
important thing.

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.277 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it sounds so simple.

01:42:28.277 --> 01:42:29.860 align:middle line:84%
But it's so hard to
do because we have

01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:31.690 align:middle line:90%
to make decisions all the time.

01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:33.707 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
hard to slow down.

01:42:33.707 --> 01:42:36.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain things--
you know, a lot of people

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
will say, in the religious
aspect, they'll say,

01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:41.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go pray about it.

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:42.140 align:middle line:90%
Which I pray, by the way.

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Just because I don't
believe in these gods that

01:42:43.710 --> 01:42:44.800 align:middle line:84%
are written about
in the Bible doesn't

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.150 align:middle line:90%
mean I don't believe in a god.

01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.233 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the divine
creator of this universe--

01:42:48.233 --> 01:42:50.590 align:middle line:84%
the real universal
creator, not the ones

01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that are written about in
these plagiarized books.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.967 align:middle line:84%
So I pray because
prayer is power.

01:42:55.967 --> 01:42:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're trying to say.

01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:00.217 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to say, when they
go, I'm going to pray about it,

01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:02.440 align:middle line:84%
talking about actually
going and meditating on it

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:05.270 align:middle line:84%
and trying to analyze
the potential outcomes.

01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:06.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real thing to do.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:07.937 align:middle line:84%
That's a real
powerful thing to do

01:43:07.937 --> 01:43:09.658 align:middle line:84%
and something I
recommend people do.

01:43:09.658 --> 01:43:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Newton's Third Law,
if you look at it

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:13.288 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific standpoint--

01:43:13.288 --> 01:43:14.830 align:middle line:84%
formally stated,
Newton's Third Law--

01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:18.400 align:middle line:84%
"For every action, there is an
equal and opposite reaction.

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.480 align:middle line:84%
The statement means that
in every interaction,

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:24.580 align:middle line:84%
there is a pair of forces acting
on the two interacting objects.

01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.380 align:middle line:84%
The size of the forces
on the first object

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.048 align:middle line:84%
equals the size of the
force on the second object."

01:43:29.048 --> 01:43:31.090 align:middle line:84%
This can be applied to
every aspect of your life,

01:43:31.090 --> 01:43:33.850 align:middle line:90%
not just on a physical object.

01:43:33.850 --> 01:43:36.610 align:middle line:84%
To give you a very simple
demonstration here,

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.390 align:middle line:90%
you see the girl on the left.

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:41.653 align:middle line:84%
She's taking a jump
shot with a basketball.

01:43:41.653 --> 01:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
The girl pushes on the ball.

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And the ball pushes
back on the girl.

01:43:44.410 --> 01:43:46.370 align:middle line:84%
But the friction keeps
the girl in place.

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:48.673 align:middle line:84%
She's got her feet
firmly on the ground.

01:43:48.673 --> 01:43:50.590 align:middle line:84%
In the second picture,
she's in roller skates.

01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:52.090 align:middle line:84%
This is when you're
making decisions

01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:54.130 align:middle line:84%
without thinking about
the consequences.

01:43:54.130 --> 01:43:55.330 align:middle line:90%
She's on roller skates, now.

01:43:55.330 --> 01:43:56.750 align:middle line:90%
She's shooting the basketball.

01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.750 align:middle line:84%
With the roller skates
taking away the friction,

01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:59.848 align:middle line:90%
the girl pushes the ball.

01:43:59.848 --> 01:44:01.390 align:middle line:84%
But the ball pushes
back on the girl.

01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:03.283 align:middle line:90%
And the girl slides backwards.

01:44:03.283 --> 01:44:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Sounds familiar with some of the
things that happen in our life?

01:44:05.950 --> 01:44:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we slide backwards
a little bit, don't we?

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:11.470 align:middle line:84%
It happens to all of us
because we make decisions

01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:15.380 align:middle line:84%
without considering
the consequences.

01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.898 align:middle line:84%
The Seventh Principle--
the Principle of Gender.

01:44:18.898 --> 01:44:19.940 align:middle line:90%
"Gender is in everything.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything has masculine
and feminine principles.

01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:24.545 align:middle line:90%
Gender manifests on all planes."

01:44:24.545 --> 01:44:26.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is true.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a masculine
energy in the universe

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.050 align:middle line:84%
and a feminine energy
in the universe.

01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And they both have
their own purposes.

01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:35.570 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the biggest
misconceptions that

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:38.150 align:middle line:84%
has been going on, like
I talked about yesterday,

01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:40.020 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that,
for whatever reason--

01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:41.020 align:middle line:90%
well, I know the reason.

01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:44.270 align:middle line:84%
It's suppression of
the female energy.

01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Men have suppressed and
oppressed women and suppressed

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the fact that the
female energy is

01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the creation energy
of the universe

01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and the most powerful
energy in the universe,

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.768 align:middle line:90%
outside of consciousness.

01:44:57.768 --> 01:44:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Energetically, it's where
everything-- everything

01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:02.428 align:middle line:84%
comes through a womb, including,
like I talked about earlier,

01:45:02.428 --> 01:45:03.470 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the matrix.

01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
You have to come out of the
womb in order to be born again.

01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And male energy has
more to do with some

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:11.810 align:middle line:84%
of the more technical
side of things,

01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:16.160 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the female
energies and helping guide it.

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.140 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at, for example,

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:19.730 align:middle line:84%
the oppression of
the female energy--

01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:20.830 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you a simple example.

01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:21.955 align:middle line:90%
Anybody here been to Egypt?

01:45:21.955 --> 01:45:22.992 align:middle line:90%
Cairo?

01:45:22.992 --> 01:45:24.110 align:middle line:90%
OK, I've been to Cairo.

01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:25.280 align:middle line:90%
You've been there.

01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:26.900 align:middle line:90%
Very dirty.

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:28.893 align:middle line:84%
Buildings look
disgusting and tore down.

01:45:28.893 --> 01:45:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about where the
people live, not the pyramids.

01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:32.977 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
where the people live.

01:45:32.977 --> 01:45:34.880 align:middle line:84%
The streets have
garbage in the streets.

01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.037 align:middle line:84%
They dump garbage-- there's
garbage and plastic bottles

01:45:38.037 --> 01:45:38.870 align:middle line:90%
everywhere you look.

01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They've now started
dumping garbage

01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:41.570 align:middle line:90%
in back of the Great Pyramid.

01:45:41.570 --> 01:45:44.300 align:middle line:90%
They turned it into a dump.

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The structures are
dilapidated and falling apart.

01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:49.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything is one
color, like this color.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no yellow, pinks,
and blues and grays--

01:45:52.190 --> 01:45:54.410 align:middle line:90%
no different color paints.

01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Everything is one color,
and there's dirt everywhere.

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Very little greenery, not
because it's the desert,

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.280 align:middle line:90%
it's because they don't--

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.110 align:middle line:90%
it's all men running everything.

01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:07.610 align:middle line:84%
You have men dominating
the entire region.

01:46:07.610 --> 01:46:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And women are wearing
fully clothed garments.

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they can show is
their eyeballs, and that's it.

01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:16.110 align:middle line:90%
They're completely oppressed.

01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:18.740 align:middle line:84%
They have no say-so
with rights in anything.

01:46:18.740 --> 01:46:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And the place is being run
like a gigantic bachelor pad.

01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:24.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's what a
bachelor pad looks like.

01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a bachelor
pad the size of a country.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:28.960 align:middle line:90%
It's bad.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:31.158 align:middle line:84%
And that's just one small
example to give you.

01:46:31.158 --> 01:46:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And as you look at more
of these countries,

01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and you start to realize,
man, why this is going on?

01:46:35.970 --> 01:46:37.720 align:middle line:84%
You start to look at
the women and realize

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.980 align:middle line:90%
they're being oppressed.

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:40.750 align:middle line:84%
There's no feminine
input whatsoever.

01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:45.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a small example of
no feminine input in a region

01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and how destructive it
can be to the area in how

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:49.840 align:middle line:90%
it looks, smells and feels.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:50.917 align:middle line:90%
You need that balance.

01:46:50.917 --> 01:46:52.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no balance, there.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.123 align:middle line:90%
There's zero balance there.

01:46:56.123 --> 01:46:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So I made this little video
about the vesica piscis,

01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:02.080 align:middle line:84%
which is an intersecting
point between the circles

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.100 align:middle line:84%
that come out of
the flower of life.

01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is where all of the
energy flows into our universe

01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:07.850 align:middle line:90%
from.

01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:09.493 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to play
this quick video.

01:47:09.493 --> 01:47:09.856 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Hey, guys.

01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.170 align:middle line:90%
4bidden Knowledge, here.

01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:13.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk to you
real quick about the vesica

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:16.510 align:middle line:90%
piscis and the womb of creation.

01:47:16.510 --> 01:47:18.490 align:middle line:84%
A circle actually
has two points,

01:47:18.490 --> 01:47:21.520 align:middle line:84%
point A and point B.
These two single points

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.570 align:middle line:84%
are actually clones
of one another.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:26.950 align:middle line:10%
And those two points
have equal potential

01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:29.530 align:middle line:10%
because point A can
rotate around point B.

01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:33.030 align:middle line:10%
And point B can
rotate around point A.

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:36.450 align:middle line:10%
This is one radius that
both circles share.

01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:40.080 align:middle line:84%
The black form in the middle
is called the vesica piscis.

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:43.920 align:middle line:10%
You are literally looking
at the womb of the universe.

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Every single thing that exists
emanates from the vesica

01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:48.030 align:middle line:10%
piscis.

01:47:48.030 --> 01:47:51.930 align:middle line:10%
I mean, all-- all of the
vibratory frequencies

01:47:51.930 --> 01:47:54.360 align:middle line:10%
that create our
material world actually

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.670 align:middle line:10%
emanate from this womb.

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:59.730 align:middle line:84%
The energy from the matrix
is feminine by nature.

01:47:59.730 --> 01:48:02.100 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
it the Sophia energy.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:07.690 align:middle line:84%
They already knew the universal
energy was actually feminine.

[END PLAYBACK]

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.483 align:middle line:90%
So you have to understand.

01:48:11.483 --> 01:48:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You look at-- you slice open an
orange, you slice open a lemon.

01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:17.570 align:middle line:84%
You look at a female
that's giving birth.

01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Everything is coming
out of a womb.

01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:21.947 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the way it is.

01:48:21.947 --> 01:48:23.030 align:middle line:90%
That's just the way it is.

01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:25.160 align:middle line:84%
That's just an archetype
of the true reality

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of the energy and frequencies
that pour into this dimension.

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:30.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a scientist
that took a flask.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And in this flask, he
heated it and sterilized it.

01:48:34.410 --> 01:48:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And then he took it and
turned it into a vacuum

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:39.020 align:middle line:84%
so that it had nothing
in it-- completely

01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:41.750 align:middle line:90%
sealed the top and the bottom.

01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And then he came
back in a few days.

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And he took it and put it
under an electron microscope.

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And guess what happened?

01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Inside that vacuumed, sterilized
glass jar that he had,

01:48:52.690 --> 01:48:54.020 align:middle line:90%
were life forms--

01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:56.840 align:middle line:84%
microscopic-level
lifeforms, but lifeforms.

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Fully formed-- fully formed.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, things that
look like insects and scorpions,

01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:04.727 align:middle line:90%
but on a microscopic level.

01:49:04.727 --> 01:49:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You can only see them with
an electron microscope.

01:49:06.810 --> 01:49:08.240 align:middle line:90%
Where'd they come from?

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:10.303 align:middle line:84%
Where'd they come--
it's amazing.

01:49:10.303 --> 01:49:11.720 align:middle line:84%
See, we're just
beginning to learn

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:13.100 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of the universe.

01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:14.960 align:middle line:10%
The Seven Principles
streamlined--

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:16.225 align:middle line:10%
"Mind may be transmuted."

01:49:16.225 --> 01:49:18.350 align:middle line:10%
That's what we were talking
about at the beginning.

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:19.030 align:middle line:10%
All is mind.

01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.180 align:middle line:10%
"Mind may be transmuted."

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:23.090 align:middle line:10%
You can take information
that you get.

01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:24.020 align:middle line:10%
You can vocalize it.

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.020 align:middle line:10%
And you can actually turn
it into something that

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:28.160 align:middle line:10%
happens in your own reality.

01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.500 align:middle line:10%
There's a form of
alchemy, there.

01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.480 align:middle line:10%
"From state to state,
from degree to degree,

01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:34.438 align:middle line:10%
from condition to condition,
from pole to pole,

01:49:34.438 --> 01:49:36.260 align:middle line:10%
from vibration to vibration.

01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:39.830 align:middle line:10%
True hermetic transmutation
is a mental art."

01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we're
all striving for.

01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:46.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to realize that
your body is an avatar.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Your body is
literally an avatar.

01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Your body is a
biological robot that

01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:53.600 align:middle line:84%
is being inhabited by
photonic energy, which

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.290 align:middle line:90%
is really your spirit.

01:49:55.290 --> 01:49:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit mind,
your spirit conscious,

01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.705 align:middle line:84%
came and inhabited
this biological avatar

01:49:59.705 --> 01:50:00.830 align:middle line:90%
at the moment of inception.

01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So at the moment that that
sperm got into the egg,

01:50:05.190 --> 01:50:06.090 align:middle line:90%
there's a spark.

01:50:06.090 --> 01:50:07.340 align:middle line:90%
This is scientifically proven.

01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.900 align:middle line:90%
There's a spark that happens.

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to say in biology
that this spark occurs because

01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:14.330 align:middle line:90%
of some chemical process.

01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:16.370 align:middle line:84%
In my personal opinion,
that's literally when--

01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that spark of light is when
your photonic energy that

01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:20.660 align:middle line:84%
is you-- your light
being-- enters

01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:23.120 align:middle line:90%
into this biological robot.

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:27.230 align:middle line:84%
Because from that point forward,
you begin to operate it.

01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:30.440 align:middle line:84%
If you were to remove your spark
out of your body right now,

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.700 align:middle line:84%
your body would
drop to the ground.

01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It would become an
inanimate object.

01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:36.680 align:middle line:84%
The human body literally
is nothing more

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:38.177 align:middle line:90%
than a biological robot.

01:50:38.177 --> 01:50:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And to prove that, we'll
look at this video,

01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:41.552 align:middle line:84%
here, where they've
taken this monkey

01:50:41.552 --> 01:50:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and broken its spine to the
point where the spinal cord is

01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:47.300 align:middle line:84%
completely detached
from the upper part.

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But they put a little Bluetooth
beam in his head and one

01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:51.830 align:middle line:90%
below the broken spine.

01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:52.955 align:middle line:90%
And let's see what happens.

01:50:52.955 --> 01:50:53.755 align:middle line:90%

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:09.950 align:middle line:10%
>> To decode the brain
activity is not really new.

01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:14.270 align:middle line:10%
To stimulate the spinal cords
is not really new, either.

01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:16.260 align:middle line:10%
But there is cessation of both.

01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:19.790 align:middle line:10%
And to make the link between
the decoding of this brain

01:51:19.790 --> 01:51:22.460 align:middle line:10%
and the stimulation
of the spinal cord,

01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:27.190 align:middle line:10%
and to make this communication
exist, is completely new.

01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:29.460 align:middle line:10%
>> If you have an injury
of the spinal cord,

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.810 align:middle line:10%

implanting electrodes under
part of the brain that

01:51:44.630 --> 01:51:46.190 align:middle line:10%
controlled the limb.

01:51:46.190 --> 01:51:48.950 align:middle line:10%
The activity and
information it recorded

01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:51.930 align:middle line:10%
showed the movement the
monkey intended to make

01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:53.440 align:middle line:10%
and was sent to a computer.

[END PLAYBACK]

01:51:54.612 --> 01:51:55.412 align:middle line:90%


01:51:55.412 --> 01:51:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice.

01:51:58.370 --> 01:52:01.213 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're just
scratching the surface.

01:52:01.213 --> 01:52:02.630 align:middle line:84%
We're just scratching
the surface.

01:52:02.630 --> 01:52:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So when I tell you that somebody
lives for 100,000 years,

01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:07.460 align:middle line:84%
don't be like,
this is impossible.

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.323 align:middle line:90%
It's very possible.

01:52:08.323 --> 01:52:09.740 align:middle line:84%
We have 3D printers
right now that

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:14.660 align:middle line:84%
can 3D-print organs, nerves,
and even blood vessels.

01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:17.660 align:middle line:84%
We have the capability
of recreating lungs, now.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We have technology that can go
in through stem cell technology

01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and cure all different types
of illnesses in the body.

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
We have the capability
of utilizing technology

01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:31.868 align:middle line:84%
like this to bypass spinal cords
through wireless technology.

01:52:31.868 --> 01:52:33.410 align:middle line:84%
We have the capability
now of putting

01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:35.452 align:middle line:84%
in bionic eyes, which have
already been developed

01:52:35.452 --> 01:52:36.920 align:middle line:90%
and installed into people.

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We have all these capabilities
occurring all at once.

01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:41.060 align:middle line:90%
We have now a new device.

01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.690 align:middle line:90%


01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.710 align:middle line:84%
This kid at Harvard
developed it.

01:52:45.710 --> 01:52:47.720 align:middle line:84%
You put on this little
helmet that goes around

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.800 align:middle line:90%
behind one of your ears.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.660 align:middle line:84%
It picks up the information
from your brain.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:53.420 align:middle line:84%
It detects your brainwaves
and communicates

01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:56.372 align:middle line:84%
directly to this device
what you're asking it to do.

01:52:56.372 --> 01:52:57.830 align:middle line:84%
This device is
connected to Google.

01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So he can go silently
without moving his lips

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.200 align:middle line:84%
and ask this device
any question.

01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.700 align:middle line:84%
What is the current temperature
in Los Angeles, California--

01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:05.900 align:middle line:90%
without saying anything.

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the device will
go search on the internet

01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:09.617 align:middle line:84%
and give him the answer
right back in his ear,

01:53:09.617 --> 01:53:10.850 align:middle line:90%
without us hearing it happen.

01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:12.308 align:middle line:84%
The next thing you
know is he knows

01:53:12.308 --> 01:53:15.950 align:middle line:84%
the temperature of Los Angeles,
and he could be in India.

01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:18.818 align:middle line:84%
So he literally has the
internet on his ear.

01:53:18.818 --> 01:53:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And anything he wants to
know, he just has to think it.

01:53:21.110 --> 01:53:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And the answer
comes back to him.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you see how now he can be
considered a god in a less

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:28.430 align:middle line:90%
advanced civilization?

01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:31.110 align:middle line:84%
He knows the answer to
everything you could ask him.

01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:31.910 align:middle line:90%
He now is a god.

01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:33.500 align:middle line:84%
He can even answer
surgical questions

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.160 align:middle line:90%
because it's all on Google.

01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:35.960 align:middle line:90%
You see?

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a small
fraction of how powerful

01:53:40.010 --> 01:53:42.920 align:middle line:84%
the human race can become
and where we can head to.

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:45.110 align:middle line:90%
And we're wrapping it up, here.

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:48.320 align:middle line:84%
The Last Words of Thrice
the Great Hermes--

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.600 align:middle line:84%
"Wise words, although
written by my decaying hand,

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:52.760 align:middle line:84%
remain imperishable
through time,

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:56.450 align:middle line:84%
imbued with the medicine of
immortality by the All-Master.

01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Be unseen and undiscovered
by all those who will come

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.510 align:middle line:84%
and go, wandering the
wastelands of life.

01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:05.690 align:middle line:84%
Be hidden until an older
heaven births human beings

01:54:05.690 --> 01:54:07.550 align:middle line:90%
who are worthy of your wisdom."

01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:09.480 align:middle line:90%
That's us.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.480 align:middle line:90%
We're here.

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.980 align:middle line:90%
So this is the secret.

01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:12.820 align:middle line:90%
This is the mystery.

01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the key that
we need to bring out

01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:17.800 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
the Hermetic Principles.

01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.950 align:middle line:84%
The main purpose this was
all done was for our time.

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:23.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually in the
moment right now where

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.730 align:middle line:84%
we're able to read
this information,

01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:27.730 align:middle line:84%
decipher it, understand it, and
actually apply it in our lives

01:54:27.730 --> 01:54:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and try to ascend to another
level of consciousness.

01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:32.600 align:middle line:90%
And that is the main goal.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So I want to thank
everybody for coming out.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.730 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate you all.

01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:37.928 align:middle line:90%
I have to run.

01:54:37.928 --> 01:54:39.392 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:39.392 --> 01:54:41.840 align:middle line:90%


01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.458 align:middle line:84%
We've got to wrap
this up because I

01:54:43.458 --> 01:54:44.500 align:middle line:90%
have to make this flight.

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.417 align:middle line:84%
But I really appreciate
the time that you guys

01:54:46.417 --> 01:54:47.530 align:middle line:90%
came and spent here.

01:54:47.530 --> 01:54:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Please go to 4bidden
Knowledge dot com.

01:54:49.890 --> 01:54:51.860 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a copy of the book,

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:53.110 align:middle line:90%
you can get it on the website.

01:54:53.110 --> 01:54:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It will get delivered
to you probably

01:54:55.690 --> 01:54:59.040 align:middle line:84%
within a two-week time frame,
because each book, I autograph.

01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.370 align:middle line:90%
I autograph every single book.

01:55:00.370 --> 01:55:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I've autographed over
12,000 books, now.

01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stop
when I get to 50,000.

01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.162 align:middle line:90%
That's my goal.

01:55:06.162 --> 01:55:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So when I get to
50k, I'm stopping.

01:55:07.620 --> 01:55:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And might you be the
reincarnation of Thoth?

01:55:10.490 --> 01:55:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> We all are.

01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:14.960 align:middle line:84%
I think that, if you remember
our conversation yesterday

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.348 align:middle line:84%
with fractals and
how consciousness

01:55:17.348 --> 01:55:19.640 align:middle line:84%
can be transferred from one
person to another, one body

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.233 align:middle line:84%
to another, I think through
his words of wisdom,

01:55:22.233 --> 01:55:23.900 align:middle line:84%
he has literally found
a way to transfer

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
his consciousness into me,
you, and everybody else here.

01:55:27.650 --> 01:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And kind of like a
fractal technology,

01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.910 align:middle line:84%
we're all taking on small
bits of his knowledge

01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:34.040 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom and his spirit.

01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're putting it back out
there to help people in service

01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:38.938 align:middle line:84%
to others and help
them develop and evolve

01:55:38.938 --> 01:55:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and grow and raise
their own consciousness.

01:55:40.730 --> 01:55:42.515 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we
all are probably

01:55:42.515 --> 01:55:45.140 align:middle line:84%
a fractal of Thoth himself, just
because we're all sitting here

01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.045 align:middle line:90%
learning about it.

01:55:46.045 --> 01:55:47.170 align:middle line:90%
So thanks again, everybody.

01:55:47.170 --> 01:55:48.840 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate y'all.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:50.040 align:middle line:90%
