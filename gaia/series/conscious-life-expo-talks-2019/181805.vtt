00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So excited to see
you all here today.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So I'm assuming you came
to talk about shame, right.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.683 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can't make up my
mind either by the way.

00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the first thing I
wanted to say some of you

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:90%
have seen me obviously before.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%
Some of you have not.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.748 align:middle line:84%
I apologize if I trigger
the hell out of you today.

00:00:33.748 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty famous for it.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.398 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:39.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want you to
understand something about me

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.023 align:middle line:84%
before we get into
this work, and it's

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
that I don't support
spiritual novocane.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that
is that so much

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff that we do in the
spiritual field and so many

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
of the tools that we have that
can be used as harmfully for us

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:90%
as they can be used for good.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.236 align:middle line:84%
We all know that pain killers
have their place but--

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.069 align:middle line:84%
by raise of hands, this
will be interesting.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.444 align:middle line:84%
How many of you
have known people

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:08.486 align:middle line:90%
to get addicted to pain pills?

00:01:08.486 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Now what if I told you the
spiritual field is basically

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.345 align:middle line:90%
a pain pill today?

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:84%
Some of you get where
I'm coming from?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.530 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we're
doing in this line of work

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
is to escape from
healing because it's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:90%
a coping mechanism.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
We're using very
powerful tools actually

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to go in the opposite
direction of healing,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:90%
and that is not what I'm about.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And those of you who
have any familiarity

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.940 align:middle line:84%
with genuine healing
know that it is usually

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.133 align:middle line:84%
really uncomfortable because
it causes you to look straight

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
at the things you
don't want to look at,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's definitely
the case with shame.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.435 align:middle line:84%
Shame does not exist without
us being a social species.

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that we
have to understand about shame

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
is that it exists
because we are social.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.338 align:middle line:84%
Every single one of you
has been socialized.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the process of you
coming in as a little kid

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and being told, yes,
you can do that.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:90%
No, you can't do that.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Now funny thing happens.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
When we grow up in
a social species,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.130 align:middle line:84%
our survival is dependent
upon our closeness

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:90%
with the social group.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This has vast
implications because it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:84%
means that we have to actually
for the sake of survival

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:84%
alter ourselves for
the sake of what

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.620 align:middle line:84%
gets his approval in our
childhood experience.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And without that,
there's no shame.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.360 align:middle line:84%
If anybody has-- think
by raise of hands,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
how maybe you've heard
of feral children?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Feral child sermon is
pretty interesting.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like when they get
a lot of these situations

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in places that are war torn
areas where a family will just

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:84%
abandon a kid, and for whatever
reason, it ends up surviving.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
But because it doesn't
have any connection

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to a human social group,
there is absolutely

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:90%
no shame in their being.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:84%
They can run around on
four legs, bark at you

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
like they would a dog, and they
don't feel any of that thing

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:90%
that we call shame.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
It's because there has been
nobody to educate them into it.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So what's very
difficult about breaking

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.990 align:middle line:84%
free of a shame-based
identity is

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to admit that it
comes from the people

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.913 align:middle line:84%
that you want to
be the closest to.

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing
that I want you

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.455 align:middle line:84%
to understand before I
break into this conversation

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:24.715 align:middle line:84%
is that contrary to popular
belief, I am not anti-parent.

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.182 align:middle line:84%
My dream is to get
all generations

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
to be healing together.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It's just rarely ever the case.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.657 align:middle line:84%
It's usually people
that are here,

00:03:34.657 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
and their family's
like, oh, Teal Swan

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.020 align:middle line:84%
ruined our entire family
because this person healed away

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not my intention I swear.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be brave
enough to actually realize

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that there is no parent alive
today who is going to do

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:90%
perfectly with their child.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
And as a person who is a
conscious parent myself,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:90%
I hate that.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a nightmare
when you understand

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the kind of damage that
you're doing to your children

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:90%
You can see it can't you?

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.245 align:middle line:84%
When you become
conscious enough,

00:04:07.245 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
you can see how
what you're doing

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:90%
is going to have this outcome.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
So it's hard to know--

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
if a person's not perfectly in
alignment, which no one really

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.252 align:middle line:84%
is, and they're not
really perfectly in sync

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
with their own expansion and
they haven't perfectly healed,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
then they are going to
affect their children.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%
That's the reality.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.293 align:middle line:84%
And even the way that
your society is set up

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
makes it rather
impossible as well.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.033 align:middle line:84%
So what parents are
trying to do today

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:39.700 align:middle line:84%
is really do the best
they can with what

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:90%
they have from where they are.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But that being
said, all of us have

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
to accept that no matter how
good your parents were or bad,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
they actually did do damage.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
They put you in a position
completely unintentionally

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:90%
to have to heal.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show you up here
people learn better when they

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
are learning not only through my
voice but also through visuals.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do is to show you

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.497 align:middle line:84%
how shame functions with
an actual demonstration

00:05:13.497 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
because hopefully this is going
to change the way that you see

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.997 align:middle line:84%
shame for the rest of
your life because people

00:05:17.997 --> 00:05:19.510 align:middle line:90%
don't get what shame is.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.510 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be going
to all kinds of things,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
probably even did during this
whole workshop event thing

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that you were at, where people
are talking about shame.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:90%
How do we break free from shame?

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.965 align:middle line:84%
But I want to just ask you
the question what is shame?

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Just for a second,
just think about it.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.007 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody asks you the
question, what would you say?

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.808 align:middle line:90%
>>

00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.702 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:49.896 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.896 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You see none of this is a
true understanding of shame.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.775 align:middle line:84%
Most of us say shame is a
feeling of unworthiness.

00:05:57.775 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a most common
answer that you'll

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
get because that's what's been
propagated over and over again.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.540 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling of not
being good enough.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
That's not actually
what shame is.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion that we
have that we call shame

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
is actually secondary
to what shame is,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.870 align:middle line:84%
which is a biological
affective reaction.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Now you guys do know
it biological affective

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
reactions are because you
know what fight or flight is.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Fight or flight is an example
of a biological affective

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:90%
reaction.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
You can't not flinch if
something comes up to your face

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.357 align:middle line:90%
and does that to you, can you?

00:06:35.357 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
What if I told you
shame was the same?

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.550 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
If shame in and of itself is a
biological affective reaction,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.650 align:middle line:90%
you can't get away from it.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to happen.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Now what we're calling
shame is a self-concept.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.590 align:middle line:84%
Actually it's just
a cascade of effects

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:84%
that happen in the
psyche as a result of how

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.157 align:middle line:84%
we respond to that biological
affective reaction.

00:07:02.157 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
This will make more
sense when I demonstrate

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%
this entire thing on stage.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But the preface
is we got to stop

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.540 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of shame.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
Interesting, huh?

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.714 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.714 --> 00:07:17.985 align:middle line:84%
I have some nice
little volunteers.

00:07:17.985 --> 00:07:24.912 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be mom.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.190 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:90%
This is mom.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
This could be dad.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.512 align:middle line:90%
This could be a school teacher.

00:07:34.512 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
This could be
anybody that matters

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.500 align:middle line:90%
in your life experience.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Now before we introduce you to
mom's role in this whole thing,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:90%
I need you to get something.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:84%
As a social species for
thousands upon thousands

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
of years, your survival
depended upon your closeness

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:90%
with the social group.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.175 align:middle line:90%
And it's no different today.

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
I love it when
people say they're

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
independent because
it's complete BS.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:84%
You're completely dependent
on whether somebody makes sure

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.195 align:middle line:84%
that there's a road for
you to drive on today.

00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:03.820 align:middle line:84%
What would happen
today-- swear to God,

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:90%
just think about it right now--

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.775 align:middle line:84%
there's no more food
the grocery store.

00:08:06.775 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Most of you in a metropolitan
city die by the way.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.614 align:middle line:90%
So you're totally dependent.

00:08:13.614 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
And even beyond that.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.500 align:middle line:84%
We're dependent upon
others because we

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
have emotional needs.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And regardless of what you have
heard in the spiritual field,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.052 align:middle line:84%
those emotional needs
cannot be met by you.

00:08:29.052 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:84%
I realize that I'm going to
get aggressive with this,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.409 align:middle line:90%
and most people don't like it.

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:33.209 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of us find our
way into the spiritual field

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
because we have
been hurt by people.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
You don't go looking for God
if your family's awesome.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
You go looking for
things like that

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.380 align:middle line:84%
when you need to find love from
somewhere else, because you're

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:90%
not getting it.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now it's really
profoundly painful

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
to not get those
emotional needs met.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is we gravitate
towards spiritual philosophies

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
that tell us, you
don't need to need it.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Everything you want,
you can find within.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But in my view, this is not
only a complete rejection

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves as people,
it's causing so much damage

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
on the planet today to
stay as disconnected

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:90%
as we are from each other.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we teaching
people to have

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
intimate relationships and
lifelong connections instead?

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:90%
Are you with me?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Even back in the cave
days and still today, you

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
have to be close to the people
in your life experience.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:90%
Closeness is everything.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:84%
If you took a tiny baby, even
today, just tiny little baby,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
laid them out on the
sidewalk, it takes hours

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
before that child's dead.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:00.250 align:middle line:84%
You are totally
relationally dependent.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is extreme
for a physical human,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.790 align:middle line:84%
more so than it is for
another animal species.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:90%
So a deer, right?

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's just take a deer.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
A deer is born, and
within hours, it's up,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.400 align:middle line:90%
and it's roaming around.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to nurse
on its mother for years,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.690 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a deer.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:90%
That's better than a human.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.450 align:middle line:84%
We are not walking
around up to deer

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of some
meadow and saying,

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
you know, you're pretty
dependent on your social group.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking you should probably
develop some independence

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
because they could
leave you one day.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.313 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't do that
to a deer, would you?

00:10:44.313 --> 00:10:45.480 align:middle line:90%
We wouldn't do it to a deer.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't do it to horses.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
We understand why dogs
go to hell when they're

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:90%
stuck in a pen by themselves.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:90%
But we expect this of ourselves.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
I got a problem with this.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Because, yet again, so
much of spirituality

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
is about denying
our physicality,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:90%
denying our biology.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
We need to integrate our biology
and integrate our humanity,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.952 align:middle line:90%
not try to get away from it.

00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:11.856 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at how shame
fits into the picture.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
This is mom.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Now mom wants the
best for us, right?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a rare parent that's
like, I deliberately

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:90%
want to destroy your life.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:90%
Maybe some of you had those.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
But what she's not going to
be aware that she's doing

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
is going into an
attitude of disapproval.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The socialization process is
about reward and punishment.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about approval
and disapproval.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And so a child doesn't have
to even receive words in order

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.050 align:middle line:90%
to perceive that judgment.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I know you know what it's
like when your mom or dad just

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:90%
casts you that look, right?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm using you guys.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.580 align:middle line:90%
OK, so, mom, over there.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.830 align:middle line:90%
What do you disapprove of?

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself in the
scenario in childhood.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.360 align:middle line:90%
She's five.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.536 align:middle line:90%
Let's make her five.

00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Bothering me.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.755 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so I [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Why are you bothering her?

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I want
to know things.

00:12:27.916 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't have time.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't have time.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I have too much
going on in my head.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.778 align:middle line:90%
I need to focus on me.

00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, did you feel that?

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So that was actually
a pretty light one.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But if you were to look at
the energy between them,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
is what she just did
a push-away or a pull?

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Push-away.

00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to get really
attuned to this, by the way,

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because there are two primary
movements within the universe

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to relationships--

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to push away and to
include as part of oneself.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So away and towards--
these are the two movements

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
you need to concern
yourself with so as

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:90%
to understand this full picture.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.930 align:middle line:84%
When a parent does something,
say something, or even

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
just emits the energy of
pushing away their child,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.800 align:middle line:84%
what happens to the nervous
system of the child?

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Fight or flight.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Fight or flight.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
This child has to re-establish
closeness immediately.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
What has she made an enemy of
in this particular circumstance?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Questions.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.880 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Needs.

00:13:38.303 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:84%
What it is that when a kid
wants to know the answer,

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
when they want your
time, it's like--

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what the child perceives
in this circumstance is

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it's not OK to need me,
it's not OK to want me.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So the child, even on
a subconscious level,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.740 align:middle line:84%
what's getting rejected
in me is the need for mom.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.910 align:middle line:90%
That is not OK.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So what she has to
do to re-establish

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
a relationship with her mother
is to triangulate internally.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:84%
You guys understand
triangulation yet?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.420 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:90%
I know you do.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.035 align:middle line:90%
You just don't know you do.

00:14:16.035 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Ready for this?

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.637 align:middle line:84%
Pretend they're not who they
are in their roles right now.

00:14:19.637 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Pretend that she and
I, we know each other,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:90%
and we also know her.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.738 align:middle line:84%
Triangulation is, you
know, I don't really

00:14:26.738 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
think she should have
treated you that way.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Who does she think she is?

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
>> You're way better.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.926 align:middle line:90%
>> So am I.

00:14:35.926 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
What I just did was to establish
rapport and closeness here

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.652 align:middle line:90%
through exclusion.

00:14:44.652 --> 00:14:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing-- and
this is the first movement

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:90%
of shame--

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.070 align:middle line:90%
is to triangulate internally.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The way to re-establish the
relationship with the parent

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is to push a part
of yourself away.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that this is
the needy aspect, right?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So stand in front
of one another.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Right now, the psyche is united.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
When we're first born,
there are some caveats,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:84%
but for the sake of
your understanding,

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
pretend that when
you're first born,

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.030 align:middle line:84%
your psychology, your
being, is united.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And when we encounter
circumstances like this,

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:90%
it can't stay united.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It actually has to fracture
and fragment in order to cope.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so much of
what you're dealing

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
with in your adult life
that is causing you

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:84%
problems is because of
this fragmentation process.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So in the moment that the mom
pushed her away like that,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.560 align:middle line:84%
she has to triangulate by
establishing closeness here,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
by pushing the part of
her that needs away.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:84%
So show what that
looks like, physically.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Look at the triangle.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Now this is all happening in
an invisible way, internally.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But what's set up here
now is a triangle,

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
whereby this one gets closer to
mom by pushing a part of itself

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:05.550 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.485 align:middle line:90%
This is what shame is.

00:16:06.485 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
This is your
definition of shame.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm changing your
definition of shame.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Shame is to push
yourself away from you.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that, can you?

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
On a physical level.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, if
I was to take a knife,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.990 align:middle line:84%
draw it down my body,
I can't do that.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm not living anymore.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
That's not how
physicality works,

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.130 align:middle line:84%
but it is how
consciousness works.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The way that I
manage to push myself

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.500 align:middle line:84%
away is by splitting
myself in half.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Now the scary part-- and this
is where most of you are going

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:84%
to relate to this
as a self-concept--

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%
all of us have done this, OK?

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So all of us have
parts of ourselves

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
that rejection of,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:90%
and so we created that shame.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
This is the biological
affective reaction

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
of pushing that part
away from ourselves.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:90%
All of us have done this.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But if you grew up
in a circumstance

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.980 align:middle line:84%
where you were in specific
roles in childhood,

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:90%
like the scapegoat--

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.319 align:middle line:90%
you guys know what that is?

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, in a dysfunctional
family home,

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.089 align:middle line:84%
everybody has these
different roles.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I
think I've probably

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:84%
met two families in my lifetime
that don't fall somewhere

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:90%
on the spectrum of dysfunction.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:29.187 align:middle line:84%
This is the way that a human
social group functions.

00:17:29.187 --> 00:17:30.270 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond the family.

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
You see these
roles in companies.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:90%
You see them in sports teams.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere that humans congregate.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
It's this funny way of trying
to establish relationships.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And the scapegoat
child in the family

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.030 align:middle line:84%
is the carrier of
the family problem.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So what the family
first does is say, well,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that one's the one
with all the problems,

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and now we're going to
get all of our self-esteem

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.067 align:middle line:84%
by dealing with
that one's problems.

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes the
way that the family

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.400 align:middle line:90%
doesn't focus on themselves.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.385 align:middle line:84%
And the scapegoat
child is the nightmare

00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
for people who are in
the psychological field

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.720 align:middle line:84%
because mom and dad are
always dragging that kid in,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
like, fix the kid.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's really not the kid.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you're in that type
of a dynamic in childhood,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.247 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine that this
happens over and over again.

00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I am a little bit curious.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
How many of you would
relate to the idea

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
of having at least one parent
who you could not please?

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:90%
So a fair bit.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.270 align:middle line:90%
Your self-concept of shame.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.200 align:middle line:84%
The reason is is because
you kept doing this, over

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:90%
and over again.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't just the part of
you that's needy, right?

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's the part of you
that poses as a competition

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%
to that parent.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You ended up fracturing
like this over, and over,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and over, and over, in trying
to establish connection

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.803 align:middle line:84%
with this parent by pushing
this part, and that part,

00:18:53.803 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and this part, and that part,
and this part, and that part

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So now your self-concept is I'm
worth nothing, and I'm no good.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got that type
of a core self-concept,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.223 align:middle line:84%
this triangulation has
happened over and over again.

00:19:11.223 --> 00:19:13.265 align:middle line:84%
You actually look internally
a bit like a matrix.

00:19:13.265 --> 00:19:17.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.775 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to know
how to remedy this issue?

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that I've made you
do a deep dive into hell?

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.440 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
First, I'm actually
curious, what

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.170 align:middle line:84%
are some of the strategies
that you have heard

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
other teachers talk
to you about in terms

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.994 align:middle line:90%
of resolving your shame?

00:19:38.994 --> 00:19:40.398 align:middle line:90%
>> Self-love.

00:19:40.398 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Embrace it.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that would be genius,
but do they tell you how?

00:19:44.302 --> 00:19:45.102 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:45.102 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Personal pet peeve.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually wrote a
book on self-love

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.757 align:middle line:84%
because this was
driving me crazy,

00:19:53.757 --> 00:19:57.852 align:middle line:90%
because this is me as well.

00:19:57.852 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
When I was starting to
learn this whole process

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:84%
of self-love, it drove me crazy
how many people would tell me,

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:90%
you just need to love yourself.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But when this is your
life, it's like, well, you

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.400 align:middle line:84%
might as well tell me to build
a rocket ship, to successfully

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.130 align:middle line:84%
build a new colony on Mars,
because that would be easier.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't understand
exactly what self-love meant.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.790 align:middle line:90%
I can show you up here.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But the majority
of the strategies

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.730 align:middle line:84%
that people have
for resolving shame

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is to try to get you
to see that you're not

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.730 align:middle line:84%
that negative thing that
you have disowned, rejected,

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:90%
and denied.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:35.317 align:middle line:84%
So let's say that
you've got a woman who

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:38.040 align:middle line:90%
feels like she's super fat.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Now most people who are dealing
with that fat-based shame

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
would say, well, let's look at
all the ways you're not fat.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at how
you're beautiful, right?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you've
enhanced the split.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Do you see why?

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:84%
You're making the shame
worse with that strategy,

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:90%
which is why it doesn't work.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.653 align:middle line:84%
Or why you go to
a seminar, and you

00:21:02.653 --> 00:21:05.070 align:middle line:84%
get a tiny bit of Novocaine,
and then it's done the second

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:90%
you leave the room.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:90%
And you're back to square one.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:10%
But just to see if you can
mentally figure this out

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:10%
for yourselves, looking
at this dynamic,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:10%
just physically, how
it's playing out here,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:10%
what is the solution to
shame, knowing that to shame

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.100 align:middle line:10%
is to push something
away from yourself?

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.138 align:middle line:10%
What's the remedy?

00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:25.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Pull it closer.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:90%
So how?

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.482 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.482 --> 00:21:32.928 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:37.266 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.266 --> 00:21:41.567 align:middle line:10%
>> Naming it, like you
did, and then [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:41.567 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, naming it's good.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It's good for us
to become conscious

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.085 align:middle line:84%
of the parts of ourselves
that we are pushing away.

00:21:47.085 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.850 align:middle line:90%
Compassion's the answer.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is the
antidote to shame.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Any of you who
brought your notebook

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.213 align:middle line:90%
should be writing that one down.

00:21:57.213 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Compassion is going to be
your first step towards love.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:09.023 align:middle line:84%
To love something is to take
something as part of yourself.

00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
I want that to be your
new definition of love.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
are approaching

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:84%
love as if it's this just
elated, emotional state,

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.130 align:middle line:90%
you can't get there.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.925 align:middle line:84%
It's actually not
going to work for you.

00:22:20.925 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
If you have a part
of yourself that you

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.970 align:middle line:84%
have been taught is
detestable, a part of you

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
pushing away forever,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to try to just feel really
super warm and fuzzy

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.630 align:middle line:84%
towards that aspect
isn't going to happen.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:90%
What can happen is curiosity.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Now compassion, this is
why I'm saying compassion

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.650 align:middle line:84%
is actually the antidote
to the shame-based process,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
because compassion arises from
commonality, from shared pain.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
That means that the root of
compassion is understanding.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:55.310 align:middle line:84%
By raise of hands,
how many of you

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:57.940 align:middle line:84%
have watched a movie
where there's a bad guy,

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and everyone else in
that theater is like,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:90%
I hate that guy.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.915 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, oh,
crap, I relate to them.

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:04.885 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.170 align:middle line:84%
The reason you feel
that way, and you're not

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
pushing that part away, is
because you relate to them.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:90%
This is how to find compassion.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.830 align:middle line:84%
If you can't relate
to something,

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
you can't have
compassion for it.

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to develop
compassion for something,

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.350 align:middle line:90%
find out how to relate to it.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So if that means that you,
your central consciousness,

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.580 align:middle line:84%
let's call it, you've
got to look at the aspect

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that you really have
been pushing away,

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the one that you currently
hate or have decided

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:90%
is not appropriate.

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And you try to relate to it.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
That means I've got to develop
intimacy with that part.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Intimacy, by the
way, is the opposite

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:90%
of pushing something away.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.600 align:middle line:84%
To have intimacy with something
is to feel into it, to see it

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:84%
completely, to listen
to it, is to come

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
to a perfect understanding
of that thing.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
dive deep into it.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Cousteau could
not do that with the ocean

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.500 align:middle line:84%
if he was doing this
on the shore, you know?

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
become super curious

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:90%
of that part of yourself.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.556 align:middle line:90%
You get that so far?

00:24:14.556 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting, huh?

00:24:16.223 --> 00:24:18.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Now this is what's really fun.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.275 align:middle line:84%
When you feel that
feeling of emotion,

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
that feeling called
shame, right?

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.990 align:middle line:84%
That emotional feeling
that you associate with it.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I actually would rather refer
to this, rather than emotion,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.250 align:middle line:90%
as a feeling signature.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Just like fight or flight
is a feeling signature

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.735 align:middle line:90%
that happens in your body.

00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
It goes off, and you
feel the adrenaline hit.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:90%
That feels a certain way, right?

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.980 align:middle line:84%
When this fragmentation
process happens internally

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.583 align:middle line:84%
as a result of shame, you
feel a signature in your body.

00:24:46.583 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Become familiar with it,
because it's actually

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.760 align:middle line:90%
different for each person.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:84%
That feeling only occurs when
there's a separation internally

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.682 align:middle line:90%
that occurs.

00:24:57.682 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that interesting?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like,
on an emotional level,

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.020 align:middle line:84%
you know how it feels a
certain way to cut your leg.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
It feels a certain way when
two parts are splitting away

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.840 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.680 align:middle line:84%
That's what you're
calling shame.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
If you can, pull
that part that you've

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:20.408 align:middle line:90%
pushed away back into yourself.

00:25:20.408 --> 00:25:23.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Aww.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You no longer
feel the sensation.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:90%
You will not feel shame.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:90%
This is the antidote to shame.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to preoccupy
ourselves with is this.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:84%
When somebody reacts towards
you in a rejecting way,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in that moment, you have the
option to push that part away

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:90%
or to bring it closer.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And if that's how you
continue to react whenever

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:84%
you get that kick, that
feeling that you call shame,

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.248 align:middle line:84%
you will not be
fragmenting anymore.

00:25:54.248 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be walking around

00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:00.182 align:middle line:84%
with this feeling of
what you call shame.

00:26:00.182 --> 00:26:01.222 align:middle line:90%
Sound good?

00:26:01.222 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Do I have any questions so far?

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.750 align:middle line:90%
No?

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
I should do a mic.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's OK.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm loud.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You're loud?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give, actually,
example of situations?

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Describe an actual
feeling sensation?

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.860 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, come here.

00:26:26.115 --> 00:26:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you brave enough
to be up on stage?

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I was brave enough to
give you a hug yesterday.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Very scary.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, for example,
mom, mom, mom.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:90%
Stop.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Pushed away, to be close to mom.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but in your life?

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:90%
>> In mine?

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.883 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now you're making me scared.

00:26:42.883 --> 00:26:45.206 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:45.206 --> 00:26:48.062 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.062 --> 00:26:49.980 align:middle line:90%
What am I ashamed of?

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.700 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to be bold enough.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Here I am.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:27:00.173 align:middle line:84%
I really feel deeply
for you since yesterday.

00:27:00.173 --> 00:27:01.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad I grew
on you so fast.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And part of me
feel shame to show it.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.430 align:middle line:84%
Even to tell you, it's scary,
and I'm using this opportunity.

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And it would make
me feel weak if I

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.840 align:middle line:84%
show my interest to you or even
more love, something like that.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So I push--

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%
and you see me--

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.010 align:middle line:90%
I push that part of me.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I put my warrior pants
on, and I pretend

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I have no feelings of
love for anyone else,

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:90%
especially for you.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm just fine,
whatever, I'm there.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and definitely
feel disconnected.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the part of you that's
not OK is the part that is

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable because it loves.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:49.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:50.958 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what you're saying?

00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Vulnerability,
yeah, intimacy.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think you can
accurately become that?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Vulnerability?

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.270 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll try.

00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, as if you're facing
this aspect yourself,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.780 align:middle line:84%
let's come to
understand it, shall we?

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:05.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:28:05.632 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's the first step
of really seeing into it?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Where did it start?

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Origins are a very
good place, by the way,

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
to start with the part of you
that you feel ashamed about.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.720 align:middle line:84%
When did I begin
feeling this way

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.850 align:middle line:90%
towards this aspect of self?

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:84%
When did you learn
it was not OK?

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up in an
orphanage to be a soldier,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and all the feelings were
literally beat up out of me

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.480 align:middle line:90%
till seven-year-old.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, since childhood.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.120 align:middle line:90%
I did now allow to cry or feel.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So imagine-- this is
where shame cells come in.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.498 align:middle line:90%
You ready for this?

00:28:40.498 --> 00:28:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I love this, because I
want you to pick something

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:90%
today to work on with this.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:84%
When you take the aspect of
you that you're ashamed of,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.118 align:middle line:84%
if you close your
eyes right now--

00:28:50.118 --> 00:28:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I want you to all
try this, actually.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.618 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and think
about the part of you

00:28:53.618 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
that you're the very
most ashamed about.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Like for her, for example,
it's the part of her

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.822 align:middle line:84%
that feels that vulnerability
for loving someone.

00:28:59.822 --> 00:29:02.420 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.210 align:middle line:84%
If you closed your eyes, and
you met this part of yourself

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.790 align:middle line:84%
like it was a
separate being, almost

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.520 align:middle line:84%
appearing to you in a
black or a white room,

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
how would this
part of you that is

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
the embodiment of your shame,
what would it look like?

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.420 align:middle line:90%
How would it appear?

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It could be human.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It could be not-human.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:90%
Just look at that.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.010 align:middle line:84%
How did it appear to
you in your mind's eye?

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Now you can answer the
question for us, for you.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:90%


00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.753 align:middle line:90%
>> Mother.

00:29:30.753 --> 00:29:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It appears like a mother.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I never had one,
and all those feelings are

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.130 align:middle line:84%
associated with a mother
energy, nurturing.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Not what I mean.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.685 align:middle line:90%
You said as if human.

00:29:44.685 --> 00:29:46.523 align:middle line:84%
>> I know, but what
it is, see, that,

00:29:46.523 --> 00:29:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that's you actually trying to
get away from the vulnerable

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.470 align:middle line:90%
aspect.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.000 align:middle line:84%
The part I want
you to picture is

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.577 align:middle line:84%
the part that feels that
that love and that need,

00:29:56.577 --> 00:29:58.660 align:middle line:84%
it's like the embodiment
of your shame-based self,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.450 align:middle line:90%
the one you've made not OK.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.980 align:middle line:90%
Well, weak.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.545 align:middle line:90%


00:30:05.545 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
>> What does weakness
look like to you?

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Ugly.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:90%
Um--

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll give you an example,
and it'll make it easier, OK?

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so I grew up
with a bra-burning hippie.

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant is pink
was not allowed in my house.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That's something that dumb girls
wear, even though I loved pink.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.820 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.100 align:middle line:90%
Femininity was like a hell no.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So when I was maybe
12, 13, 14, started

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.270 align:middle line:84%
getting interested in
dressing sexier and makeup,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:84%
how do you think that went over
with my bra-burning mother?

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Whore.

00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.965 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
she used to call me

00:30:42.965 --> 00:30:45.030 align:middle line:90%
when I'd walk downstairs.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So I learned that to establish
closeness with my mother,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I would have to deny, reject,
and disown my sexuality.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.380 align:middle line:84%
Now the first time
that I did this process

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
with this aspect of
myself, if I closed my eyes

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and saw what that part
that I was rejecting

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.600 align:middle line:84%
looked like, it
looked like a siren.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Now I had an association--
this is what you'll notice,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.840 align:middle line:84%
your parts will always relate
to some association you have.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.710 align:middle line:84%
I had this association
with the sirens,

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, these women who lure
these sailors in from shore,

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:19.830 align:middle line:84%
and then you look at their
feet, and it's bones, right?

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So what it looked like in the
mind's eye was that part of me

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
was this siren,
affixed to a rock.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Now the first reaction
that I had to that image

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.180 align:middle line:90%
was total repulsion, right?

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.510 align:middle line:84%
I want nothing to
do with that aspect.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I especially don't want that
because my feeling that I

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.110 align:middle line:84%
had at the time was like, would
I really want a relationship?

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Now when I looked
closer at this part

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.930 align:middle line:84%
internally, what
I realized was it

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
kept shooting laser
beams out of its eyes.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.030 align:middle line:84%
This is just how it
appeared in my mind's eye.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:52.452 align:middle line:84%
It kept shooting
these laser beams

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and killing all
these men that were

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.190 align:middle line:90%
coming into shore off of boats.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that the
energy of the siren herself

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.127 align:middle line:90%
was totally miserable about it.

00:32:02.127 --> 00:32:03.960 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like she
couldn't control that

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and wanted a relationship,
but every time

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.900 align:middle line:84%
she opened her eyes
towards a man, he'd die.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.240 align:middle line:84%
So that was the first
understanding breakthrough

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.890 align:middle line:84%
that I had towards
that part of myself.

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It actually really desperately
wants a relationship,

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.610 align:middle line:84%
but feels like it is a danger
to men, which is exactly what I

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:84%
felt like based on my mother's
reaction, that sexuality,

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:90%
especially blatant--

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.780 align:middle line:90%
what do you call that--

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.241 align:middle line:84%
seduction was a
danger to others.

00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.680 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make more sense?

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:37.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I think what it was for me
that it's going to be burden.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
My vulnerability, my
weakness, my femininity,

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.590 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, it will be
burden to others.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So the part of
you that is a burden.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.290 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:90%
What does that part look like?

00:32:53.540 --> 00:33:00.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Little orphan,
without needing love.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it a boy or a girl orphan?

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Girl.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>> What's she dressed like?

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Naked.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.455 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of a setting?

00:33:12.455 --> 00:33:13.330 align:middle line:90%
>> What kind of what?

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the setting?

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Abandoned, like
you just mentioned.

00:33:15.683 --> 00:33:16.740 align:middle line:90%
Abandoned on the street.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.328 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:33:18.328 --> 00:33:19.745 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel
towards that part?

00:33:19.745 --> 00:33:23.070 align:middle line:90%


00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, now I embrace it.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.380 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> If that was the truth, you
wouldn't have that reaction

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.610 align:middle line:90%
towards me.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:36.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's knee-jerk reaction,
a habit, until I observe it.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:42.050 align:middle line:84%
But OK, if I go back,
yeah, it feels--

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:42.890 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.460 align:middle line:90%
Like nobody wants it.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:45.260 align:middle line:90%
Nobody wants it.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It's in the shelter, and
everybody takes the good ones.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And then bold, little
one, black with bold eyes,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.690 align:middle line:90%
nobody wants it.

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:55.490 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.407 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's how you
actually feel, isn't it?

00:33:57.407 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> This is where
compassion comes in.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.440 align:middle line:90%
You can relate to that pain.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, of course.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it wrong for
that aspect to need?

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:10.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course not.

00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>> What does she really deserve?

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here, back to
self-love, at least, first,

00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:18.215 align:middle line:90%
to love itself.

00:34:18.215 --> 00:34:20.830 align:middle line:90%


00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it deserves love.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:90%
At least, your own, my own.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So here's this one,
tiny, little step.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Now this is just one part
of the process, by the way.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Mentally, if you can
imagine that orphan child,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine what can
be done in that scene

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to create an improvement in
the way that that child feels?

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'd pick
her up and hug her.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So close your eyes and do it.

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Do it.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:47.244 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'd pick her
up, and embrace it,

00:34:47.244 --> 00:34:54.400 align:middle line:84%
and say thank you for this, and
just connect deeply from heart.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And then what?

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Embrace it and love it.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you going to keep that
baby with you all the time?

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:34:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Well-- um--

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.560 align:middle line:90%
It's there.

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It's there, of course.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And it will show up, like
today, even 30 years later.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And just embracing
that part, like, OK, I

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:13.540 align:middle line:90%
know where you're coming from.

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there is no need
to show up right now,

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.720 align:middle line:84%
but loving and embracing that
part of me, and knowing it's

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.200 align:middle line:90%
there--

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I suggest something?

00:35:21.325 --> 00:35:23.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, of course.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Sitting with you right now,
it feels like you're playing

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:30.160 align:middle line:84%
the role that caregivers
played in your childhood again,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
which is like, I
get it, I see it,

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.490 align:middle line:84%
I can't really do
very much about it,

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.160 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not really a mom.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.930 align:middle line:84%
Have you thought about bringing
a mother into that aspect?

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What mother?

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Any mother.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:90%
The ideal mother.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.620 align:middle line:90%
Just play with me for a minute.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
scene where you've

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.038 align:middle line:84%
got this little orphan child,
what would the perfect mother

00:35:52.038 --> 00:35:53.380 align:middle line:90%
be like?

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:54.610 align:middle line:90%
I know you imagined one.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:55.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, to pick her up.

00:35:55.908 --> 00:35:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but what
does she look like?

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.220 align:middle line:90%
What does feel like?

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.020 align:middle line:90%
Is she big?

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.670 align:middle line:90%
Is she skinny?

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.875 align:middle line:90%
What's she dressed like?

00:36:01.875 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel it's still me.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> You really want to be a mom?

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:09.083 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but I'm a mom to
that orphan, it's within me.

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's what you want?

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:13.040 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Do I want it?

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.808 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I am it.

00:36:15.808 --> 00:36:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm trying to stretch you a
little bit because you've got

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:20.935 align:middle line:84%
the mentality that I
have to do it all myself.

00:36:20.935 --> 00:36:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Got you.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:21.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, yes.

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> That's part of that dynamic
that's keeping you stuck.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.477 align:middle line:90%
>> Blind spot, OK, I see it.

00:36:24.477 --> 00:36:25.600 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:10%
>> So my suggestion is it might
be more healing to bring--

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Someone else for
that mother energy.

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:30.710 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.560 align:middle line:10%
Do you want me to
look at you for that?

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.130 align:middle line:10%
>> If you want.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that what you're saying?

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Like my reaction--

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
But that's what you're saying,
that my reaction towards you

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.290 align:middle line:84%
was looking for
that part in you.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.220 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I saw it.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.270 align:middle line:90%
I can relate to it.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:44.197 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course.

00:36:44.197 --> 00:36:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If you want to use
me, it doesn't matter.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.863 align:middle line:90%
That'd be wonderful.

00:36:46.863 --> 00:36:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this example,
instead of imaginary,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that's actually example
of what I felt yesterday.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.217 align:middle line:84%
I felt like I turned to
face something that was

00:36:54.217 --> 00:36:56.800 align:middle line:84%
intimidating, but then-- and I
was sharing it with some people

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.600 align:middle line:90%
here--

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.060 align:middle line:84%
the way you were, it was that
feminine, nurturing energy.

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And actually, related to what
you said, you went to hug,

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:08.430 align:middle line:84%
and in that embrace, I
felt that I can be myself.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was really
an experience.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.547 align:middle line:90%
>> So use me.

00:37:13.547 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I just did.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I want you to imagine.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Just do it.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, right now,
imagine me coming in

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.350 align:middle line:90%
with this orphan child.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Now feel what it feels
like for me to say,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
care of her forever.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to worry
about her anymore.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.057 align:middle line:84%
You can see her whenever you
want to, but all of her needs

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:41.140 align:middle line:90%
are going to be met by me.

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:90%
Now imagine the attunement.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.150 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is
that every time this child

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.100 align:middle line:84%
makes a noise, I'm going
to try to understand

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.150 align:middle line:90%
exactly what she needs.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:38:00.042 align:middle line:90%


00:38:00.042 --> 00:38:04.260 align:middle line:84%
What does that feel
like in your body?

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Peace.

00:38:05.338 --> 00:38:09.372 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.372 --> 00:38:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel the feeling of
pushing yourself away in this

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.630 align:middle line:90%
moment?

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.223 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There you have the
antidote to shame.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:25.494 align:middle line:90%


00:38:25.494 --> 00:38:26.947 align:middle line:90%
Now you can do this exercise.

00:38:26.947 --> 00:38:29.030 align:middle line:10%
This is just an easy one
to do in your mind's eye.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.690 align:middle line:10%
I like to give you
guys this exercise,

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.500 align:middle line:10%
because how many times do we
run into these circumstances

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.300 align:middle line:10%
in a day, where
somebody says something,

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.040 align:middle line:10%
we feel it as a
rejection, and we

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.737 align:middle line:10%
respond by rejecting that
part of ourselves, right?

00:38:40.737 --> 00:38:42.570 align:middle line:84%
If, in that moment, you
can close your eyes,

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and see the part of
you you're rejecting,

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and do anything like this, it's
basically a mental resolution

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.880 align:middle line:84%
process, it's just
a visualization,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.650 align:middle line:84%
you will feel the
sensation vanish.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It's really creepy,
actually, you guys.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:59.621 align:middle line:84%
It's really creepy
how easy it is.

00:38:59.621 --> 00:39:01.569 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:01.569 --> 00:39:02.543 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:39:02.543 --> 00:39:04.978 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.978 --> 00:39:15.513 align:middle line:90%


00:39:15.513 --> 00:39:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys want to understand
a tiny bit more about

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.510 align:middle line:84%
how the fragmentation
process works

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:90%
in terms of protector parts?

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Since I've got you
guys on stage, ha ha.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Because you actually got to
see a really good one just now,

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:37.010 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to
use that as an example.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.715 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you
got a little girl.

00:39:38.715 --> 00:39:40.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be the
little girl this time again.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.789 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:42.997 align:middle line:90%
>> You're good for this role.

00:39:42.997 --> 00:39:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.613 align:middle line:84%
So you've got a
little girl here who's

00:39:46.613 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:90%
in an orphan-type situation.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It does not matter whether
this child wants a family,

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.510 align:middle line:90%
wants a dedicated mother or not.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not happening, is it?

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the type of circumstance
where there is no resolution.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Do you guys
understand resolution?

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You get to a place,
it's like you're getting

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:90%
to the opposite place, right?

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So resolution is if
something's broken, it's fixed,

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.390 align:middle line:90%
or healed, or put together.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:16.030 align:middle line:84%
If someone's lonely, there's no
loneliness, there's connection.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
If you're in this
type of a situation,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.398 align:middle line:84%
there's no resolution
because this child is not

00:40:19.398 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
going to have a parent.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is when we have to cope.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.722 align:middle line:84%
Coping, even though it saves
your ass in the beginning,

00:40:28.722 --> 00:40:30.430 align:middle line:84%
always leads to problems
in the long-run.

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.110 align:middle line:90%


00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:37.360 align:middle line:84%
So in this circumstance,
how is she going to cope?

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.830 align:middle line:10%
Knowing that coping
is all about,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.950 align:middle line:10%
how do I keep myself safe
and feeling the best possible

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:45.578 align:middle line:10%
in the scenario that I
can't change anything?

00:40:45.578 --> 00:40:46.620 align:middle line:90%
You just saw it on stage.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.420 align:middle line:90%
What's the answer?

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.172 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't need it.

00:40:49.172 --> 00:40:50.158 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:40:50.158 --> 00:40:53.120 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So she's going to split into
a part that does not need it

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and the part that's suppressed,
which really needs it.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the one that
kept her safe her whole life,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:10.590 align:middle line:84%
this is one she's
going to identify with.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.120 align:middle line:90%


00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Now there's this connection
that happens here.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the one
that keeps you safe,

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.920 align:middle line:84%
the connection's
here, which means

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.780 align:middle line:84%
that this part of
the personality

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:26.430 align:middle line:84%
is what's feeding through
the physical embodiment.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.188 align:middle line:84%
And so when you guys
are sitting here,

00:41:28.188 --> 00:41:29.730 align:middle line:84%
looking at this
person, like you just

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.490 align:middle line:84%
were, looking at this
person from the outside,

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.850 align:middle line:84%
how are you going
to describe them?

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Tough.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Strong.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's a tough person,
that's a strong person,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:90%
pretty scary.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Little bit scared to
cross that person.

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Definitely doesn't need anyone.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.180 align:middle line:84%
You will literally describe
this person this way.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.619 align:middle line:90%
Is it the truth of them?

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:50.597 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:41:50.597 --> 00:41:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:56.570 align:middle line:90%
>> The truth is actually both.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.400 align:middle line:84%
See, in an integrated space,
which is what's healthy for us,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
we are actually the
fusion of all polarities.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.680 align:middle line:84%
So we are as independent
as we are dependent.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.350 align:middle line:84%
But when we polarize like
this so as to stay safe,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.770 align:middle line:84%
we become profoundly unstable
and profoundly unhealthy,

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.795 align:middle line:84%
because we have split
ourselves in order to cope.

00:42:17.795 --> 00:42:19.170 align:middle line:84%
This gets us into
a hell of a lot

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.750 align:middle line:84%
of trouble in our
day-to-day life

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:26.670 align:middle line:84%
because she wants
a relationship.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.445 align:middle line:84%
This part is still
a part of her.

00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Now she's going to reject,
and deny, and disown it,

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.510 align:middle line:84%
so this is going to be delegated
to the subconscious mind,

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.810 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:39.160 align:middle line:84%
You've done enough healing
that you're aware of it.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.452 align:middle line:84%
But I can't tell you how many
people I meet, especially

00:42:41.452 --> 00:42:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in the special ops--

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:43.560 align:middle line:90%
I love working with those guys.

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:45.768 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:42:45.768 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, this is
going to take a few more

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:52.620 align:middle line:84%
years to even
admit that we might

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.050 align:middle line:84%
have a little kid inside
still who needs someone.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.970 align:middle line:84%
If something is delegated
to the subconscious,

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.150 align:middle line:84%
it's in the process
of being suppressed.

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And what makes that so dangerous
is that suppression is still

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.880 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So to the degree
that we feed this one

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.000 align:middle line:84%
with our conscious energy, we
feed that one with just as much

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.848 align:middle line:90%
equal subconscious energy.

00:43:16.848 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%
The more that you
suppress something,

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the bigger of a monster it
becomes in the floorboards.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we all know about
what happens with monsters.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.310 align:middle line:84%
They can't stay under
the floorboards for long.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.080 align:middle line:84%
They always end up breaking
through in some way.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you're in a time-space
reality that is based off

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.272 align:middle line:90%
of the law of attraction.

00:43:35.272 --> 00:43:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It drives me nuts what
people teach about that.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:84%
But a better way of calling
this is the law of mirroring.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:84%
If you live in a world
that is based off

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of the law of
mirroring, which you do,

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:46.260 align:middle line:84%
everything that is
internal is going

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:52.460 align:middle line:84%
to reflect in the
external as someone else.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:56.030 align:middle line:84%
So this means you're going to
be attracting people who reflect

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.408 align:middle line:90%
both this part and this part.

00:43:59.408 --> 00:44:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But have you noticed
something funny?

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:05.052 align:middle line:84%
A magnet-- positive
and negative do what?

00:44:05.052 --> 00:44:07.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Attract.

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So is she going to be
attracted to people like this?

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:10.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.330 align:middle line:84%
She's going to be attracted
to people like that.

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:15.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a way, actually,
that the universe

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.610 align:middle line:90%
helps you to integrate.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Loving, slash, obnoxious, right?

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.515 align:middle line:84%
When you meet somebody who is
the external representation

00:44:26.515 --> 00:44:28.640 align:middle line:84%
of an aspect of yourself
that you have pushed away,

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.562 align:middle line:84%
you will feel instantly
one of two ways.

00:44:31.562 --> 00:44:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Either you're going
to fall in love

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.550 align:middle line:84%
with this person,
head over heels,

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.520 align:middle line:84%
have no idea why you
can't live without them.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Or you are going to want
to run so far and so fast,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.390 align:middle line:84%
you never want to
see them again.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Fun, huh?

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So when people are
talking about everything

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.960 align:middle line:84%
you meet in the
outside is actually

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:55.040 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of the inside, this
is what they're talking about.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Fun, huh?

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.210 align:middle line:84%
But most of you are not
even aware of the parts

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:02.030 align:middle line:84%
that you've
subconsciously suppressed.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So this means any
time you meet somebody

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:84%
in your external
reality, that is you.

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You actually have to own
it as part of yourself.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot easier
said than done.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Do I have any questions so
far about this whole thing?

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I should get a microphone
in the audience somehow.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.500 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think through this one.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:34.360 align:middle line:90%


00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So since shame is so
effective at keeping us away

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.320 align:middle line:84%
from each other, if
you're a woman or a man,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and I do what you're
saying to do, like,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.362 align:middle line:84%
I become one with myself
and these different aspects,

00:45:47.362 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:84%
so now, I've got to relate
to all these people.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
bad people out there.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.445 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
people who don't

00:45:52.445 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:90%
have my self-interest intact.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.177 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I don't
want to lose my shame,

00:45:56.177 --> 00:45:59.080 align:middle line:84%
because if I get close to these
people, I'm going to get hurt.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you up to
working up here?

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:46:07.515 --> 00:46:09.990 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:16.930 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying
you enjoy your shame?

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.265 align:middle line:90%
>> I was sort of being sardonic.

00:46:21.265 --> 00:46:24.070 align:middle line:90%


00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.393 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so say it again in
a way that's not that way.

00:46:26.393 --> 00:46:27.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Um.

00:46:27.379 --> 00:46:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So when I feel shame, I'm
not getting close to people

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:44.600 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:50.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would like to with
my son and other people.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I'm very successful in
some ways, so it's worked.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.910 align:middle line:90%
So why do I want to give it up?

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're
lonely as hell.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I what?

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you're lonely.

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But I have a lot of
amazing people in my life.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.520 align:middle line:84%
>> That you're
not very close to.

00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:08.458 align:middle line:90%
>> But I'm not lonely.

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.450 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I love myself.

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:12.626 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you don't.

00:47:12.626 --> 00:47:14.385 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:14.385 --> 00:47:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but I came here, and
I learned how to love myself.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I went to a bunch of seminars.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.260 align:middle line:90%
I read your--

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but here's the thing--

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:90%
self-love is a process.

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.195 align:middle line:90%
Self-love is a process.

00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:31.570 align:middle line:84%
I can't look at
you today and say

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.860 align:middle line:90%
I am completely self-loving.

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how much
work I do on myself?

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably more than
most people ever do.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably more than most
people do combined in this

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.810 align:middle line:90%
room.

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.770 align:middle line:84%
To be sitting in this
position where I am today,

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:56.230 align:middle line:84%
this is what I'm doing when
you're at the movie theater.

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.563 align:middle line:84%
This is what I'm doing when
you're working your day job.

00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:00.370 align:middle line:84%
This is my life,
day in and day out.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.088 align:middle line:90%
I do not love myself completely.

00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:03.880 align:middle line:84%
There is no possible
way you can look at me

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.535 align:middle line:84%
and say, "I love
myself completely."

00:48:05.535 --> 00:48:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then that's
why you're not happy,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.880 align:middle line:90%
because you don't love yourself.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Why am I talking
to you like this?

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking to you because
you've got to get this.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
We have this idea
that there's going

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.270 align:middle line:84%
to be some pill
we can take where

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:24.910 align:middle line:84%
overnight, [SNAP] the entire
process of fragmentation

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:25.990 align:middle line:90%
is resolved.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell you, if I find
that button, I will teach it.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.140 align:middle line:90%


00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I will throw everything that
I have done out the window.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason I'm teaching
what I am teaching today.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I have not found
that button yet,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and I have not met someone
who has that button.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I have met a lot of people
who lie that they have it.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:50.235 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
scares me to death.

00:48:50.235 --> 00:48:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And those people have
a lot of power, sometimes,

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in our life, and a lot of money,
and they can hurt us really

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.830 align:middle line:90%
bad.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they can.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.820 align:middle line:84%
But where are we
going with that?

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.563 align:middle line:90%


00:49:05.563 --> 00:49:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Love is a practice.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.147 align:middle line:84%
Do you want me to tell you how I
got the closest that I possibly

00:49:09.147 --> 00:49:11.050 align:middle line:90%
could get to it?

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:13.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.540 align:middle line:84%
It is the rejection
of self that is

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.190 align:middle line:84%
causing this problem that
you have with other people.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's actually self-betrayal.

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Now you should be
listening to this.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I go into
the space of this

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.720 align:middle line:84%
is a problem because something
you, yourself, is doing,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:84%
it's a big deal, because I
like to teach relationships.

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that doesn't
teach that you're

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.538 align:middle line:90%
the root of everything, right?

00:49:39.538 --> 00:49:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm not teaching you that
everything you can find

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.150 align:middle line:90%
is from within.

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So when I tell you that there's
a pattern that's originating

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:48.270 align:middle line:90%
internally, listen carefully.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.340 align:middle line:84%
What causes us to
fear other people

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.060 align:middle line:90%
is actually self-betrayal.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And we are doing this
towards ourself all day

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.100 align:middle line:90%
long, all day long.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I watched myself
do it yesterday.

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I needed to go up to my room
probably an hour before I

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.580 align:middle line:90%
actually went.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.940 align:middle line:84%
I was bulldozing a part of
myself for an hour straight,

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.110 align:middle line:90%
and I teach this stuff.

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.508 align:middle line:84%
>> But the self-betrayal,
we're taught that,

00:50:16.508 --> 00:50:17.800 align:middle line:90%
and we can earn a lot of money.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm denying
the aspect of myself,

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.930 align:middle line:84%
my creative side, my music
side, I make a lot of money

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.940 align:middle line:84%
as a lawyer or a
financial accountant.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.487 align:middle line:84%
And then I can buy a
house, and then I'm cool.

00:50:27.487 --> 00:50:29.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that the way you
want the world to be?

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:29.690 align:middle line:90%
I mean this literally.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:30.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No, absolutely not.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you got to stop it.

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.550 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:37.550 align:middle line:90%
There comes a point--

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I swear to God, there comes this
point-- you're probably there,

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.170 align:middle line:90%
aren't you?

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Where it's like,
I either continue

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.240 align:middle line:84%
to perpetuate a world that
is this way because this

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.510 align:middle line:84%
is the way that it
works so far, or I

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:51.500 align:middle line:90%
decide I can't do it anymore.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.930 align:middle line:90%
And what I'm hoping--

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm wanting this to
be a whole movement here--

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:58.923 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping that people
are willing to be

00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:01.090 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable enough to
change the way the world is.

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.378 align:middle line:90%


00:51:03.378 --> 00:51:04.670 align:middle line:90%
This is the opposite of coping.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:05.470 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:06.365 align:middle line:90%
>> But a lot--

00:51:06.365 --> 00:51:07.606 align:middle line:90%
but when we're in--

00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:10.582 align:middle line:90%


00:51:10.582 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:84%
when we're in relationships,
and we're having this dynamic,

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.290 align:middle line:84%
let's say I watch your videos,
and interact with people,

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.288 align:middle line:84%
and I make them
uncomfortable, they run.

00:51:18.288 --> 00:51:19.830 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh,
you're not supposed

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.872 align:middle line:90%
to make me uncomfortable.

00:51:20.872 --> 00:51:24.590 align:middle line:84%
If I'm feeling bad, this is
wrong, so I'm going away.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:25.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Then get different friends.

00:51:25.892 --> 00:51:28.302 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:28.302 --> 00:51:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> What if that happens to
be your mom or your son?

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with children,
that's a whole other shebang.

00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:84%
I might do a whole
separate workshop

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.910 align:middle line:84%
on just parenting
for this reason.

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But there will
come a point where

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:46.500 align:middle line:84%
a person has to be lonely enough
to decide into relationships,

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.000 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.470 align:middle line:84%
We've got this
attitude where it's

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.520 align:middle line:84%
like, I've got to change
the way that everybody is.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to change them so that
they can be in a relationship.

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:57.300 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you have to
choose with your free will

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.590 align:middle line:90%
to be in a relationship.

00:51:58.590 --> 00:52:00.620 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make
you uncomfortable.

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And we can't make
people make that choice.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.578 align:middle line:84%
>> But a lot of people, they
think they're exercising

00:52:04.578 --> 00:52:06.960 align:middle line:84%
their free will when they're
engaging in things that

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.705 align:middle line:90%
aren't making them comfortable.

00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:10.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to engage
their authentic free will

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.020 align:middle line:84%
to be uncomfortable
to be close to people.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have
a relationship.

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't have a
relationship with that.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But if we're being
rewarded for that,

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:25.290 align:middle line:90%
how do we change that?

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that we're
rewarded in the marketplace

00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:30.700 align:middle line:84%
by being an asshole accountant
or an asshole lawyer.

00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.700 align:middle line:90%
You make a lot of money.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Start a different
marketplace.

00:52:33.176 --> 00:52:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of you, by the way, who
are sitting in this room,

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.515 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be in this
position, where it's not

00:52:41.515 --> 00:52:43.807 align:middle line:84%
going to work anymore to fit
yourself into a world that

00:52:43.807 --> 00:52:44.610 align:middle line:90%
is dysfunctional.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.608 align:middle line:90%
It will not happen.

00:52:46.608 --> 00:52:48.150 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to be a pioneer.

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:49.860 align:middle line:90%
That day sucks.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.030 align:middle line:90%
It sucked for me.

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:54.055 align:middle line:84%
There was a day when I
realized I don't fit in here.

00:52:54.055 --> 00:52:55.180 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to happen.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:53:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because what my vision
is, it doesn't exist yet.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So then it's about I got
to be the one to do it.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you meet people who
are actually also doing it.

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're stepping
out on the wave of expansion,

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:12.270 align:middle line:84%
thinking, I'm the
only one out here.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:15.713 align:middle line:84%
And then you look sideways,
and you're like, oh, crap.

00:53:15.713 --> 00:53:17.130 align:middle line:84%
You were just in
a different city.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.690 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's this uncomfortable
transition

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.970 align:middle line:90%
is where you are right now.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think that's
emblematic of a lot of people.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:33.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not wanting to
be uncomfortable.

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.340 align:middle line:84%
The one you talk about in
one of your videos where

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:37.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a sinking
boat, and then you're--

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that one called?

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't remember.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Endurism.

00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the universe
will sink your ship.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember that one.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.180 align:middle line:90%
What about it?

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Meaning that it's difficult
to jump ship from the sinking

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.412 align:middle line:84%
boat that we're used to swimming
in or living in, and jump

00:54:00.412 --> 00:54:01.620 align:middle line:90%
on that other boat, because--

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.662 align:middle line:84%
>> But are you worried
about doing that yourself,

00:54:03.662 --> 00:54:06.515 align:middle line:84%
or are you worried about
forcing other people to do that?

00:54:06.515 --> 00:54:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a
combination of both.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Because why would I want
to jump off my boat,

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and then there's no
one else in the sea?

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.450 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I jump on
that lifeboat that's cool,

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:20.953 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else is on
the Titanic that's sinking.

00:54:20.953 --> 00:54:22.120 align:middle line:90%
Why would I want to do that?

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not going to be able
to make this safe for you.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.030 align:middle line:84%
See, what you're watching,
I hope you can recognize.

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.400 align:middle line:90%
See, this is a perfect moment.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I want you to recognize
this in yourself.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We got to own this
as ourselves, right?

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.800 align:middle line:90%
All of us have this aspect.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.065 align:middle line:84%
All of us have this
aspect that say--

00:54:40.065 --> 00:54:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm dramatizing
it on purpose too.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.990 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.434 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm actually not this
difficult in real life.

00:54:49.434 --> 00:54:51.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:54.633 align:middle line:84%
Actually, some people
would disagree with that.

00:54:54.633 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I love this though.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I love that you're like, well,
I'm not really like this.

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:58.390 align:middle line:90%
This is just an entire act.

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.223 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I can't
have relationships.

00:55:00.223 --> 00:55:02.628 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:02.628 --> 00:55:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:07.792 align:middle line:90%
You know I love you, right?

00:55:07.792 --> 00:55:10.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I don't even understand
where we're going with this?

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.510 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going with this?

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.010 align:middle line:84%
There's no way that you can
make somebody comfortable enough

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:90%
to take that risk.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.090 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the hardest
things about being awake

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:18.890 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:20.182 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not in this boat alone.

00:55:20.182 --> 00:55:22.390 align:middle line:84%
I know you guys
are in this boat.

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Where you understand what
cliff someone's headed

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
towards if they don't
shift something,

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:30.535 align:middle line:84%
and you still can't
make it happen.

00:55:30.535 --> 00:55:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what
I'm talking about.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.807 align:middle line:90%


00:55:34.807 --> 00:55:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Other than realizing that
everyone has their own free

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.557 align:middle line:84%
will and being willing to feel
your emotions when they hit

00:55:39.557 --> 00:55:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the cliff, there is
nothing you can do.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.653 align:middle line:84%
You can't steal someone's free
will from them, no matter what.

00:55:45.653 --> 00:55:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But a lot of people aren't
really exercising it though.

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:48.880 align:middle line:90%
You know that.

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:49.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course I know that.

00:55:49.922 --> 00:55:52.715 align:middle line:84%
But I also can't
force them to, can I?

00:55:52.715 --> 00:55:54.840 align:middle line:84%
But this is the thing that
I wish that we would all

00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.530 align:middle line:84%
get about the universe, if
only just for ourselves,

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:02.030 align:middle line:84%
the universe not
so lovingly, slash,

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:06.110 align:middle line:84%
lovingly, does this thing
where if you won't shift,

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.480 align:middle line:90%
the reflection will get bigger.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.927 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't shift,
it will get even bigger.

00:56:11.927 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the day comes-- this
is the day most people are ready

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:16.550 align:middle line:84%
for my workshops--
the day comes--

00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.177 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:56:18.177 --> 00:56:20.510 align:middle line:84%
The day comes where you hit
a wall so big that you can't

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:90%
run away anymore, can you?

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter whether
you're uncomfortable.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Then you're ready to do
the real work of healing.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm hoping people can
choose that before they

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:33.160 align:middle line:84%
get so uncomfortable
they get forced into it.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.220 align:middle line:84%
But I have never found a
way to force them into it.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Nor would I really want
to because free will

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.125 align:middle line:90%
is so important.

00:56:40.125 --> 00:56:43.380 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree, but I don't see it.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.340 align:middle line:90%


00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean--
meaning that I see

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:54.470 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people who say like
you were saying earlier,

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that they're loving themselves,
and they're all independent,

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing
their own thing.

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.690 align:middle line:84%
But they're really
not, and they're

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.648 align:middle line:84%
really good at convincing
themselves and others

00:57:01.648 --> 00:57:02.568 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:57:02.568 --> 00:57:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so listen for
the people that are saying

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:06.320 align:middle line:90%
they're not there yet.

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:07.700 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Following the teachers
who say, I am enlightened,

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.820 align:middle line:90%
is a dangerous, dangerous game.

00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Find the ones who are
like, nope, not there yet.

00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:15.500 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be safe.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:17.958 align:middle line:84%
The same way as somebody who's
like, no, I'm not completely

00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:19.395 align:middle line:84%
in love with myself
yet, probably

00:57:19.395 --> 00:57:21.520 align:middle line:84%
actually is closer to
self-love than the people who

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:24.992 align:middle line:90%
are in denial about it.

00:57:24.992 --> 00:57:27.944 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:31.460 align:middle line:90%
You good?

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.448 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:35.444 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:35.444 --> 00:57:41.920 align:middle line:90%


00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.210 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so that being
said, my message today,

00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:47.450 align:middle line:84%
if you didn't get it already,
is that you have got to embrace,

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that is accept, own, the parts
of yourself that people have

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.190 align:middle line:84%
told you are not OK and help
other people do the same.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Because it's my
hope that we can end

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the fragmentation in
ourselves and, by doing so,

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.380 align:middle line:84%
end the fragmentation
in this world.

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for standing
with me in this movement

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and know that I love
you guys very much.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:09.190 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:15.382 align:middle line:90%
