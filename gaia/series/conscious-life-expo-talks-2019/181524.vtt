00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everybody.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.035 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the warm welcome.

00:00:11.035 --> 00:00:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.230 align:middle line:10%
This is a first and
thank you for being

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:10%
here for that as well.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.280 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of things
that we'll be getting into.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
And in order to try
and keep it flowing,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:10%
I may move fast on
some of the information

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.580 align:middle line:10%
about some of the history.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:10%
I think that the issue that
we're going to be facing

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.550 align:middle line:10%
is how do we cram
it all into an hour.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:10%
And then I hope
to have 30 minutes

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:10%
at the end for some Q&A.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.230 align:middle line:10%
All right, so let's get--

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:10%


00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:10%
I am Jason Rice.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:10%
I am an SSP officer veteran
as well as a US Army

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:10%
Corps of Engineers veteran.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.755 align:middle line:90%
I am an engineer.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:10%
The talk today is related to my
own experiences with the SSP.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
to keep in mind

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:10%
is that there are
many SSP programs.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:10%
There's not one.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.530 align:middle line:10%
There are probably dozens.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.490 align:middle line:10%
And if you think
about it, somebody

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.560 align:middle line:10%
may be working on a
component for a spacecraft

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:10%
or advanced technology
and they have

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:10%
no idea what they're doing,
except that they're just

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.210 align:middle line:10%
piecing this part together.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:10%
They are a member of the
SSP, but they don't know it.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:10%
So there are lots of pieces
and parts to the SSP puzzle.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:10%
And my discussion today is
only about my own experiences

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:10%
within the SSP, within
the IDARF program.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.340 align:middle line:10%
Because of the extreme
compartmentalization,

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.700 align:middle line:10%
there is a lot of information
that people in one program

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.560 align:middle line:10%
aren't going to
know about another.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.460 align:middle line:10%
Even those at the very
top of the rank structure

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.932 align:middle line:10%
are not going to know
about other SSP programs.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:10%
And we'll get into
that in a few minutes,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:10%
why they designed
the system like that

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:10%
and why they designed
the programs like that.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.180 align:middle line:10%
And I think only disclosure,
when it happens, not if,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.120 align:middle line:10%
when, because it
will, when it happens,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:10%
I think we'll find
out a lot more

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:10%
about the various programs.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:10%
Now if you're looking at
the screen here, you see--

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:10%
what is this wheel?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you've
seen this before.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
This shows the Bilderberg Group,
how many people are involved

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.556 align:middle line:90%
in it, their interconnections.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:08.240 align:middle line:10%
And this gets back to
the Cabal, their control

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:10%
of every aspect of our
lives, from the media,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:10%
to education, to
national defense.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:90%
This is a compartmentalization.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
The people that work for
these, the people that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
operate in this world,
are not entirely

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.100 align:middle line:84%
aware of the other
aspects of the SSP

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%
that they may be involved with.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
things that we can

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
expect to have happen as
disclosure happens, is that--

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the only suggestion
I can make is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.100 align:middle line:84%
that expect anything and
everything, from one end

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.070 align:middle line:90%
of the spectrum to the other.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be momentous
joyful disclosure technologies

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.500 align:middle line:84%
that we'll find out
about, but there will also

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
be some very tough truths that
we will have to work through.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:10%
One of the things
that I'd like to ask

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.850 align:middle line:10%
is, is there anyone in here
that likes being lied to?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.360 align:middle line:10%


00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Nobody.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:10%
I didn't think so.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.230 align:middle line:10%
I know I don't.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:10%
Well, as disclosure
happens, one of the things

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:10%
that people are going to have
to deal with are the lies.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:10%
Individually, we're
going to go through,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:10%
as well as civilization, as
well as the entire planet, what

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:10%
is referred to as the
five stages of grief.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:10%
You've got the
denial, anger, that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.103 align:middle line:10%
was one for me, bargaining,
depression, and acceptance.

00:05:14.103 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:10%
The list of offenses,
there's going to be lies.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:10%
There's going to be cheating
you'll find out about,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:10%
stealing, murder, greed, pretty
much every form of bad actions

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:10%
are some of the things
that we'll find out.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, they've been
perpetrated on our mothers,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:10%
on our fathers, brothers, and
sisters, sons, and daughters.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And these things go
back 80-plus years.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:10%
As far as the plan,
these guys, to get us

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.130 align:middle line:10%
all under one world government.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And despotic control means that
nobody can argue with them.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:10%
So that was the plan.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:10%


00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:10%
Elected officials, unelected
officials, they're involved.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.100 align:middle line:10%
There's people in corporations
that are involved.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:10%
There's people in every
level of government.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:10%
Now one of the things that
I'm sure you're going to say

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:10%
is, well, gosh, I'm awake.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:10%
I've got my eyes open,
and throw it at me,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:10%
come on, give me all the truth.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:10%
The only thing that
I would say to that

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.890 align:middle line:10%
is that to be careful
what you ask for.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:10%
Because while we may be able
to handle all the truths, how

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:10%
about your neighbors, or your
family, or your co-workers?

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.800 align:middle line:10%
And the same thing about
toxins, and getting

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:10%
used to it, from a standpoint
of the global consciousness,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:10%
how are you going to
react to your family,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:10%
or friends, or neighbors that
are going through those five

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:10%
stages of grief?

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:10%
How is it going to affect us?

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:10%
Because we're caring,
we're compassionate,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.220 align:middle line:10%
we want to help people.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:10%
So naturally it is
going to affect us.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.760 align:middle line:10%
We're not machines.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:10%
We're not cold.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.680 align:middle line:10%
We're not going to just sit
idly by why our loved ones are

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:10%
crying over the fact
that they've been

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:10%
lied to for their entire life.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:10%
OK, so what is the
Secret Space Program?

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, as I mentioned a few
minutes ago, one of them

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.510 align:middle line:84%
is the IDARF, the Interplanetary
Defense And Reaction Forces.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:10%
So where did that come from?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:10%
Well, in order to
get there, we're

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.820 align:middle line:10%
going to have to go back
in time a little bit

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:10%
and talk about some
of the history,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:10%
going back to the 1930s.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And how did we get from this
to this, advanced technologies,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.980 align:middle line:90%
or to that?

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:90%
How did we get there?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
We went from almost
seemingly overnight

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:84%
from advanced
anti-gravitic technologies

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.564 align:middle line:84%
and a wide range of other
technologies, medical, science,

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:35.364 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:10%
So let's get into the
history, how we got there.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
1930's Germany, the Germans
prior to World War II,

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
were very interested in
esoteric mysticism as well as

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of
alternative views

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
on life, and connections,
and energies.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They scoured the entire planet
looking for further clues

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:90%
and more information.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Now in 1936-37 is when
they began their contacts

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and communications
with the Draco.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.790 align:middle line:10%
Well, who are the Draco?

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:10%
Well, they are an
alien race that

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:41.420 align:middle line:10%
is reptilian based that are not
very nice, to put it mildly.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:10%
These are negative ETs.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:10%
They are definitely
service, self oriented.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.420 align:middle line:10%
So shortly after their first
contacts with the Draco,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:10%
the Germans decided,
OK, well, they're

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.280 align:middle line:10%
saying that there's some
technology down in Antarctica.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.720 align:middle line:10%
So we should go down there.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.190 align:middle line:10%
So in 1938-39, they had
an expedition down there.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:10%
The SS Neuschwabenland
was the ship.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.310 align:middle line:10%
And they carved out
a particular area.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.635 align:middle line:10%
And I think you'll see that the
area they carved out is in--

00:10:18.635 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:10%


00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:10%
does this have a laser?

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.100 align:middle line:10%
No, OK.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:10%
It's in the Queens Land, Queen
Maud Land area on the map

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:10%
And on the right
hand side, you'll

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.690 align:middle line:10%
see those orange pieces
are actually mountains.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:10%
So the entire boundary
from a defensive,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:50.155 align:middle line:10%
from a military standpoint,
is essentially an offset.

00:10:50.155 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:10%
It gives them some property, and
protection, and some defense,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.960 align:middle line:10%
and depth from the
mountains, where

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:10%
they ended up putting
Base 211, the first one.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.370 align:middle line:10%
So let's go through the
timeline a little bit.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:10%
They departed Antarctica
in February 1939

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:10%
and made it back to Germany
a couple months later,

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:10%
April time frame.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:10%
And guess what else happened,
just a few short months later.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's exactly
right, they invaded Poland,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:10%
in September, five--

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:10%
four or five months later.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't know about
you, but I don't believe

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:10%
in those kinds of coincidences.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:10%
So they must have seen
something, found something,

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.110 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, they were
told what was there.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:10%
And they confirmed it.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.560 align:middle line:10%
And then once they confirmed
it, that furthered their plans

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.335 align:middle line:10%
for world domination.

00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And so 1940s, let's go
through a little bit,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:10%
they started building out
and stocking their base

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:10%
in Antarctica, so
that they would

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:07.987 align:middle line:10%
be able to contain, feed, house
upwards of 300,000 people.

00:12:07.987 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:10%
There were thousands
involved with it.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.120 align:middle line:10%
Most of them were
native Germans,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.148 align:middle line:10%
so that they could keep the
information compartmentalized.

00:12:16.148 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:10%
Again, there's that word.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:10%
They were able to use
the geothermal properties

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:10%
underneath the mountains for
their power source initially.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.520 align:middle line:10%
Later on, they developed
alternative advanced

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:10%
technologies so
they wouldn't have

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.080 align:middle line:10%
to rely solely on geothermal.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:10%
But it was there.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:10%
And they already had some
advanced civilization

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:10%
that had been abandoned,
that they were told

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:10%
to go investigate by Draco.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.960 align:middle line:10%
Draco wanted that technology.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:10%
So around 1940, the Germans
make their first visit

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:10%
to the moon in the Haunebu
I. And the same time period

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:10%
back on Earth was the period
when the German Navy had

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:10%
commissioned some auxiliary
cruisers, which basically

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.970 align:middle line:10%
are converted civilian ships.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:10%
One of them was named Penguin.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:10%
And the other one, surprisingly
enough, was named Atlantis.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.560 align:middle line:10%
Again, another
interesting convenience.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:10%
It's not a touch screen.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:47.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.970 align:middle line:10%
All right.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.770 align:middle line:10%
So during that time in the
war, the Cabal was in charge

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:10%
and had resources in which
they had loaned Germany money.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Germany was paying
back the loans.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:10%
They had financed them through
their rebuilding efforts

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.400 align:middle line:10%
in the '30s, as
well as financing

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.380 align:middle line:10%
their military expeditions
of the early '40s.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:18.040 align:middle line:10%
What happened is that Germany
decided that, hey, you know,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:10%
we really don't need
this central bank.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.830 align:middle line:10%
We're going to instead start
bartering with other countries

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:10%
so that we don't have to use
a fiat centralized currency.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Well this of course
upset the central banks.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:10%
And the central bankers decided
to get other people involved.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:10%
And walla-- the world is at war.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:10%
In 1941, the US
declares war on Germany.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.880 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:10%
Now this same time frame
was when they were working

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.790 align:middle line:10%
on building up their base.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And so the U Boat activity
after 1941, they were able to--

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:10%
well, their two
auxiliary cruisers

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:10%
had been sunk by that time.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:10%
But they had enough
U Boats in which they

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:10%
didn't need any surface ships.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:10%
So they were using
the subsurface ships

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.520 align:middle line:10%
for transportation to
and from their base.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:10%
They had advanced
technologies on their U Boats

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:10%
so that they didn't
have to surface.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.703 align:middle line:10%
They were also some of that
first stealth technology

00:15:23.703 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:10%
that had ever been released.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:32.085 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.085 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:10%
Oh, that doesn't look good.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:38.562 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:10%
All right, we'll
work through that.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:10%
In 1944, Germans
returned to the moon.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:10%
And they're scouting for
a base at this point.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:52.806 align:middle line:84%
Now they also visit Mars for
scouting purposes as well.

00:15:52.806 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
In 1945 through '48, the Germans
start infiltrating the allies.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.300 align:middle line:10%
And their purpose was
to get people in place.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:10%
And they started off with
getting people in the military,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:10%
getting people enlisted, getting
people involved in politics, so

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.270 align:middle line:10%
that they could get
them deeply embedded

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.162 align:middle line:10%
into the Allies' governments.

00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:23.940 align:middle line:10%


00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:10%
The public portions that
have been advertised

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.142 align:middle line:10%
are Operation Paperclip.

00:16:32.142 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:10%
In 1946-47 was when the
Antarctic Germans, the AG,

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:10%
started negotiations
for a moon base.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:10%
Because they found out that
the property on the moon is

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:10%
occupied by other
alternate alien races.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:10%
And so they had to negotiate
with someone to get a base,

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.870 align:middle line:10%
to get property, to get a lease.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:10%
The Draco had done
their homework

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:10%
and had assured that nobody else
would deal with the Germans.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:10%
So the Germans were forced
to work with the Draco.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:10%
So 1947 was when the Antarctic
Germans enacted their lunar

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:10%
base.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:10%
Now what did the Draco want in
exchange for 20 acres of lunar

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:26.849 align:middle line:10%
landscape?

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:31.560 align:middle line:10%
And I tell you, 20 acres
is really not that big.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.260 align:middle line:10%
There's not much you
can do with 20 acres,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:10%
except for building down, which
is what they eventually did.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:10%
The Draco wanted 225 humans and
25 years worth of first refusal

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:10%
rights on the technology.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.411 align:middle line:90%
That's what they wanted.

00:17:51.411 --> 00:17:54.840 align:middle line:84%
At first they
wanted all females.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Germans knew
that in order for them

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:84%
to have a successful
civilization,

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
they needed as many females
for propagation purposes

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.300 align:middle line:90%
as they could.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So they didn't even bother
with answering that.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Came back later, six months
it took them to finally reach

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:90%
an agreement.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:10%
They came up with
still the 225 citizens

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:10%
and 25 years of technology
first refusal rights.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:10%
Now to give you an idea
of the kind of negativity

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:10%
that these Draco
are, when they landed

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:10%
to come collect
their prisoners, they

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:41.930 align:middle line:10%
used technology to freeze
people, to lock them in place.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And they also used memory
alteration technology

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
that was feeding everybody
in that cave images

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of mutilations, images of every
type of atrocity imaginable.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And the people couldn't
do anything about it.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Why did they do that?

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they thought
it was funny.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It was their own sense of humor.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Something that is sick
by any normal standards.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Two guards escaped because
they were outside the--

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
they were outside
the freeze field,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
way of putting it,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
the mobilization field.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
make it to the exit.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was how
the security forces

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
were able to discover what
had happened, and the images

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that they were sent, the things
that they were experiencing

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.040 align:middle line:90%
while they were in that chamber.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
After that, the 278
losses, because eventually

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
those two guards suicided,
five years later,

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.960 align:middle line:84%
and they vowed that
they would never

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:90%
use their own people again.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:90%
So who would they use?

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:90%
The rest of the planet.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:10%
So between the years
of 1947 and 1952,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:10%
the Antarctic Germans
lost about 1,000 people

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.070 align:middle line:10%
on building out their moon base.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Some of them had to do with
building the enclosures

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:10%
so that they would seal.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:10%
Some of it had to do
with sensor technology,

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:10%
because in order to
operate in a vacuum

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:10%
you need to have remote
sensors and they were still

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.370 align:middle line:10%
working on that technology.

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:32.850 align:middle line:10%
Again you got to think that
the Antarctic Germans had

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.470 align:middle line:10%
a mixture of extremely
advanced technology and 1940s

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:10%
technology.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:10%
Now they were on an
incredible learning curve

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:10%
because their lives
depended on it.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:10%
But that was what they
were working with.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:10%
Now there's a lot of things
that happened in 1947.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:10%
In February-- well,
starting in November of '46,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:10%
the US government had sent
a flotilla of Naval ships

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:10%
down to Antarctica to
test Antarctic operations.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:10%
Now given the amount of time
between the end of World War

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:10%
II and the fact that they
had close to 5,000 people

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:10%
down there, I don't buy that.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:10%
The information that I've
gotten while I was in the SSP

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:10%
also didn't support that.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:10%
So February, Operation
High Jump ends

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:10%
and they sail back to the United
States, returning to Washington

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:10%
in April.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:10%
President Truman issues
his executive order

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:53.690 align:middle line:10%
in March, in which the loyalty
of all federal employees

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.720 align:middle line:10%
would be evaluated by the FBI.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.420 align:middle line:10%
This is when that started, for
all federal employees having

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:10%
to go through background
checks to test their evaluation

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:10%
for their loyalties.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Now at the time, McCarthyism
was running really hot.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.450 align:middle line:10%
So they blamed it
on the communists.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:10%
But what was actually
happening is that the Antarctic

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.510 align:middle line:10%
German infiltrators, that's
what they were really after.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:10%
Now later that year, guess
what happened in July.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:10%
Here's one that
everybody should know,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:10%
the Roswell event, that's right.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.560 align:middle line:10%
Now do you find
it highly suspect

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:10%
that the same month that
the Roswell event happened

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:10%
is also when the National
Security Council and the CIA

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:10%
were created?

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.510 align:middle line:10%
The same month.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:49.360 align:middle line:10%
Now the CIA took over
from the Operation

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:56.510 align:middle line:10%
of State Security, OSS, which
was handled by the military.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:00.950 align:middle line:10%
After the president
enacted the CIA,

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:10%
it was now handled by
civilians, which meant

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:10%
that the military was out.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.140 align:middle line:10%
They washed their hands of it.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:11.200 align:middle line:10%
That's right, they were able
to get the civilians in there

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.925 align:middle line:10%
so the civilians
could then control.

00:23:12.925 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:10%
September of later
that year, Majestic 12

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:27.610 align:middle line:10%
was created, again for
dealing with alien politics

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:10%
or alien recovered
craft or technologies.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Now when Admiral
Byrd left Antarctica,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:10%
he took a message with him.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:10%
Now there are alleged reports
that he made a statement

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:10%
to a newspaper about the threat
and about an enemy capable

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:51.590 align:middle line:10%
of incredible feats.

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, the other message
that he took with him

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:58.810 align:middle line:10%
was from the Antarctic Germans,
in which they were requiring

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:10%
a meeting so that
they could negotiate

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.093 align:middle line:10%
a truce, a cease fire.

00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:04.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Antarctic
Germans needed

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.052 align:middle line:10%
to have some time so that they
could build up their defenses.

00:24:07.052 --> 00:24:08.640 align:middle line:10%
That's what they wanted to do.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:10%
They had a fleet of
anti-gravitic craft.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't enough to take
on an entire globe of people

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.830 align:middle line:10%
or allies that would have
been aligned against them.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:10%
So they wanted some time
to build up their forces.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And they also knew
that the Allies

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.760 align:middle line:84%
had nothing that could
compare to their technologies.

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So December,
Operation Windmill was

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:84%
published as a-- we're
going to make our base down

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:84%
in Antarctica, which
in actually what it was

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.660 align:middle line:84%
was part of the negotiations
between the Antarctic Germans

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.790 align:middle line:90%
and the rest of the planet.

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:10%
Guess what happened in the next
year, Operation Mockingbird

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:10%
had its starts.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:04.230 align:middle line:10%
So these all go back to
a very busy 1947, 1948.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.780 align:middle line:10%
Now Frank Wisner was
a member of the CIA

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:10%
and was put in
charge of propaganda

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.410 align:middle line:10%
and the controlling
of the media.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:10%
After what happened
with Roswell,

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.610 align:middle line:10%
they did not want to go through
another incident like that.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.080 align:middle line:10%
So they decided that they
would take it on head first.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:10%
Well how do you do that?

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, you pay a
bunch of people that

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.480 align:middle line:10%
are employees of mainstream
media to do what, and when,

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:10%
and how, and whatever
you need them to say,

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.330 align:middle line:10%
Operation Mockingbird.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:10%
Now in 1972, it came out, oh,
my gosh, that's 25 years later.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:10%
Well, do you really
think that it stopped

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.350 align:middle line:10%
just because they went public?

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:02.510 align:middle line:10%
No, it did not.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:10%
So in February,
Operation Windmill 2

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.550 align:middle line:10%
was finished up, in which
the Antarctic Germans reached

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.620 align:middle line:10%
a ceasefire with the Cabal.

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Now they had expected a
formal treaty to follow.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And so what they wanted was,
again, to buy some more time.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:31.720 align:middle line:10%
So that was what
happened in 1948.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.510 align:middle line:10%
The ceasefire agreement
established the Antarctic

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:10%
Germans as a sovereign nation.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.390 align:middle line:10%
Their existence was
to be kept secret.

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.590 align:middle line:10%
The reasons for that have to
do with the Antarctic Germans

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:10%
were threatening to go public
with advanced technologies

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:10%
and the Cabal did not want
that to happen because they

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.110 align:middle line:10%
wanted to maintain control.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.200 align:middle line:10%
The other thing that the Cabal
had going for it at the time

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:10%
was that if the Antarctic
Germans had gone public

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:10%
there is a very
strong possibility

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:10%
that the rest of the globe,
the personnel, the citizens

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.020 align:middle line:10%
would have said, you know
what, even if it means

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.810 align:middle line:10%
nuclear annihilation for us all,
let's get rid of those Nazis

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:10%
once and for all.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:10%
So they kept it secret.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:10%
Because the politicians knew
that they may not have a choice

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:10%
if it went public.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:10%
It would be out
of their control,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.190 align:middle line:10%
from the citizens of the planet.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:27.220 align:middle line:10%
They establish their embassies.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.590 align:middle line:10%
They have at least
one senior executive

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:10%
and thousands of corporations.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.880 align:middle line:10%
Now what kind of corporations?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.100 align:middle line:10%
Now we're talking about
Ivy League schools.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about
engineering research schools.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.450 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about defense
contractors, agriculture,

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:50.870 align:middle line:10%
medical, research hospitals,
banks, everything imaginable.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.350 align:middle line:10%
They had at least
one senior executive,

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:58.090 align:middle line:10%
because again they had 300,000
people to do something with.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.120 align:middle line:10%
And their plan was to infiltrate
the rest of the planet

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.510 align:middle line:10%
so that they would have
their own people in place.

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.070 align:middle line:10%
One of the consolations that
they provided to the Cabal

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:10%
was that they gave them base
theories, not technology,

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.220 align:middle line:10%
but base theories.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.200 align:middle line:10%
So they had to do
their own homework.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Now having their
own people in place

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.790 align:middle line:10%
meant that essentially
they were giving themselves

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:10%
advanced theories.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.110 align:middle line:10%
So no harm, no foul,
because they're just

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:10%
giving it to themselves.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.320 align:middle line:10%
Well their own people,
being executives

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:43.740 align:middle line:10%
in these companies, the
process of advancement,

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:10%
well, you've got somebody
who has a leg up already,

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.410 align:middle line:10%
because they've got advanced
technology knowledge.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, they are on
a fast track to the CEO,

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:10%
or senior executive, or any
number of other positions.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.290 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:07.490 align:middle line:10%
Now 1948 through 1954, the
Cabal was stalling for time

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:10.670 align:middle line:10%
because they knew that they
could not stand toe to toe

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:10%
with the Antarctic Germans.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.870 align:middle line:10%
The technology level of
the Antarctic Germans

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:10%
was far beyond anything
that they could handle.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they tried with
a Naval task force.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.570 align:middle line:10%
And the Naval task
force was sent packing.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:29.090 align:middle line:10%
So 1949, the USSR fires
their first nuclear bomb.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:35.150 align:middle line:10%
Now there's evidence that shows
that the US gave the Soviet

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:37.100 align:middle line:10%
Union the plans.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.620 align:middle line:10%
Now my thinking
is that they were

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:46.010 align:middle line:10%
trying to spread out more
information so that they could

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.190 align:middle line:10%
keep the Antarctic
Germans in check

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and get more people that
are standing up against you.

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:56.030 align:middle line:10%
Then you have a better
chance of coming out ahead.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:10%
The Chinese communists
take control that year.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.490 align:middle line:90%
1950, the Korean War starts.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Hey, we can't go to the treaty
because we're fighting a war.

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Please, give us a break.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.910 align:middle line:84%
1950 and 1954,
McCarthy's Red scare.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, the US
government was searching

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.440 align:middle line:84%
for the moles and the spies
from the Antarctic Germans.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the things that
they provided as a good faith,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.620 align:middle line:84%
at least that's
what they called,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.550 align:middle line:84%
the Cabal provided the
London debt agreement,

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:90%
in which all of Germany's--

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.000 align:middle line:84%
now conventional Germany,
not Antarctic Germany--

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.900 align:middle line:84%
the Antarctic Germans still
had a connection and a love

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.890 align:middle line:90%
for their homeland.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.260 align:middle line:10%
So the Cabal took
advantage of that and said,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.320 align:middle line:10%
OK, look, give us
some more time and we

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:10%
will forgive all the war debt
before and after World War II.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.310 align:middle line:10%
So this goes back
to World War I.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:31:00.010 align:middle line:10%
Now we think that
the United States

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:10%
debt of what-- $22 trillion, is
high, how about 1,000 trillion

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:14.255 align:middle line:10%
that they forgave in
equivalent modern dollars.

00:31:14.255 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:10%
$1,000 trillion, free
and clear, that's

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:10%
what they gave to Germany.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.340 align:middle line:10%
Now during this time,
the Antarctic Germans

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.140 align:middle line:10%
were working on their moon base.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:10%
Again, they lost
about 1,000 people.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:10%
They had also started working
on their Mars base, New Berlin.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.780 align:middle line:10%
And the problem with
New Berlin is that--

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:10%
well, their goals
for New Berlin was

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:46.270 align:middle line:10%
that they had to
invade the space

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:49.580 align:middle line:10%
and take it over from
another alien race.

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:10%
Now they lost about 17,000
soldiers during that campaign.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.500 align:middle line:10%
Now it may not sound like
a lot, and one is too many,

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:10%
but if you add up all the
Allies' losses during World War

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.730 align:middle line:10%
II, this is what that accounts
for from a perspective

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.290 align:middle line:10%
of their total population.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:10%
Now it also meant that it was
some of the most physically

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.490 align:middle line:10%
fit, some of the most active.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.470 align:middle line:10%
These are the people
that they lost.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.900 align:middle line:10%
And so they knew
that they needed

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.750 align:middle line:10%
to fix their personnel problem.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:10%
And one way to do that
was to acquire more people

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.680 align:middle line:10%
for some of the
jobs and positions

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.600 align:middle line:10%
that their people couldn't
fill or didn't want to fill.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:10%
So they stepped up their
pressure on the Cabal.

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.770 align:middle line:10%
UFO sightings
blossomed, exploded

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.360 align:middle line:10%
during that time frame.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:54.090 align:middle line:10%
There were military pilots
that gave testimony about a UFO

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:57.580 align:middle line:10%
craft that would shadow them,
that the pilot would given them

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.940 align:middle line:10%
the finger and then fly off.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And that the pilot
looked humanoid.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.580 align:middle line:10%
There were mass
sightings over DC.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:08.460 align:middle line:10%
There were mass sightings
over New York City.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:10%
I believe that was an
Andromeda class, the one over

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.960 align:middle line:10%
in New York City.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see that
in just a second.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
There we go.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:90%
That was in 1950.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.210 align:middle line:10%
Now the final straw that
the Antarctic Germans used

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:31.880 align:middle line:10%
to bring the Cabal
to the table was they

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.170 align:middle line:10%
did a nuclear demonstration
strike on a heavy cruiser,

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:41.090 align:middle line:10%
coincidentally on its way
back from Bikini Atoll

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:10%
during the US' nuclear testing.

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.770 align:middle line:10%
The Antarctic Germans
exploded a nuclear weapon

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:10%
close enough to affect the
heavy cruiser from the EMP.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.110 align:middle line:10%
Now it wasn't close enough
that it burned it up.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:10%
It didn't do it that.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.260 align:middle line:10%
They just wanted to disable it.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:10%
They wanted to get the
United States' attention.

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, of course they did.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.570 align:middle line:10%
Because it took them 12 hours
to get the ship moving again.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:10%
And then they limped
back to Hawaii.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:10%
But the Antarctic
Germans took it a step

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.739 align:middle line:10%
further because they knew
that the US government would

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.199 align:middle line:10%
probably say, hey,
you know, there's

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:25.650 align:middle line:10%
a chance that those
Navy personnel were

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.560 align:middle line:10%
too close to Bikini
Atoll and that that

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:31.900 align:middle line:10%
was the explosion that
knocked out the power, and all

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:10%
the electronics, and electrical
systems on the heavy cruiser.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:10%
The Antarctic Germans
weren't taking any risk.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:43.110 align:middle line:10%
So they had filmed
the entire operation

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:48.570 align:middle line:10%
and sent boxes of these films
to pretty much every leader

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.159 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.250 align:middle line:10%
So that there was no
question that number one,

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:54.960 align:middle line:10%
they had nukes.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.969 align:middle line:10%
They were willing to use them.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:10%
And their request
was they wanted

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.040 align:middle line:10%
to meet to come up with
a formalized treaty.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, that pretty much did it.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.910 align:middle line:10%
So as we mentioned
a minute ago, the AG

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.500 align:middle line:10%
finish up their Mars
military campaigns in 1954.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:10%
That was also the same
year that they developed

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:22.390 align:middle line:10%
their memory wipe technology.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.500 align:middle line:90%


00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.190 align:middle line:10%
So '55 through '59 was when the
Antarctic Treaty negotiations

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.990 align:middle line:10%
began.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Now Antarctica, I imagine
that everybody here

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.690 align:middle line:84%
has read or heard some
things about Antarctica.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's about the
size of the United States.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It has every natural resource,
from oil, and coal, to uranium,

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.610 align:middle line:90%
to gold, and silver.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:10%
Now has there been
another spot on the planet

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:02.557 align:middle line:10%
that corporations wouldn't
go into to drill for oil?

00:36:02.557 --> 00:36:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Think about the
depths that they would

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.070 align:middle line:10%
go to in the ocean, or the
fracking, or the lengths

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.080 align:middle line:10%
that they will go to.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:10%
Well, why didn't they
do it in Antarctica?

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.730 align:middle line:10%
It's got all these resources.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's because of
the Antarctic Treaty.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.620 align:middle line:10%
There were two components
to the Antarctic Treaty.

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.078 align:middle line:10%
There was a public
version and then

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.710 align:middle line:10%
there was a classified version.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.860 align:middle line:90%


00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.690 align:middle line:10%
Operation Deep Freeze 1
and 2 was the operation

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.900 align:middle line:10%
in which the Cabal had
built and established

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.580 align:middle line:10%
their base in Antarctica.

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And it also allowed for them
to go through the negotiations

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:90%
with the Antarctic Germans.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:10%
This time was also when the
Antarctic Germans continued

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:10%
their political espionage,
because they wanted

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.000 align:middle line:10%
to infiltrate every country,
not just one, but every country,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.120 align:middle line:10%
every major corporation,
every major organization

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.020 align:middle line:10%
on the planet.

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.062 align:middle line:10%
That was how they were
going to run their things,

00:37:01.062 --> 00:37:03.990 align:middle line:10%
and that's how they were able
to gain control over technology.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:12.220 align:middle line:90%


00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:19.420 align:middle line:10%
So 1959 was the year that the
Antarctic Treaty was enacted.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:90%


00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, what did the Antarctic
Treaty, the classified portion,

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.810 align:middle line:10%
what did it do?

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:36.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, it granted the Antarctic
Germans about 150,000 personnel

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.040 align:middle line:10%
from the rest of the world.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:44.290 align:middle line:84%
They were going to pick
them up from a place

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:90%
and time of their choosing.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.610 align:middle line:10%
They had assured the rest
of the leaders of the world

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.610 align:middle line:10%
that they would pay them,
and take care of them,

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:10%
and feed, and house
them, and give them

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.410 align:middle line:10%
fair medical treatment, and
anything that they needed,

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.260 align:middle line:10%
give them the opportunity
to become German citizens

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:10%
if they so chose at
the end of five years.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:07.220 align:middle line:10%
If they didn't, oh, well, OK,
they would send them back home.

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.560 align:middle line:10%
That didn't happen.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.030 align:middle line:10%
No surprise.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.400 align:middle line:10%
Also, as part of the
Antarctic Treaty,

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.650 align:middle line:10%
is that they had at
least one Antarctic

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.330 align:middle line:10%
German on the governing
board of directors.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.860 align:middle line:10%
So not only do they have senior
executives, at least one,

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.640 align:middle line:10%
the larger corporations
had five to 10,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:10%
but they've got now
their own people

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.080 align:middle line:10%
on the board of
directors on thousands

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.290 align:middle line:10%
of world corporations,
universities, medical research

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:39.990 align:middle line:10%
facilities, banks, financial
institutions, you name it.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:46.980 align:middle line:10%
The other portion
of their plan was

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.600 align:middle line:10%
to have at least one executive,
one of their citizens

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.910 align:middle line:10%
on the executive branch
of every government

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:10%
on the planet, at least one.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:39:00.780 align:middle line:10%
The United States had multiple
civilians from the Antarctic

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.160 align:middle line:10%
Germans within the government.

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.740 align:middle line:10%


00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.360 align:middle line:10%
Now again, their society
was to remain classified.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.460 align:middle line:10%
They didn't want it coming
out because they didn't

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.877 align:middle line:10%
want the world
ganging up on them,

00:39:13.877 --> 00:39:16.140 align:middle line:10%
and the Cabal would lose
their power and control

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.940 align:middle line:10%
if that happened.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.380 align:middle line:10%
So it was a win-win
for both of them.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.980 align:middle line:10%
The AG stopped and
ceased their overflights

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.985 align:middle line:10%
and their shadowing of both
civilian and military aircraft.

00:39:27.985 --> 00:39:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.510 align:middle line:10%
Through the '60s, the Cabal
and the Antarctic Germans

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.730 align:middle line:10%
continued their
cat and mouse game.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:10%
The Western-- the United States
effort to put a man on the moon

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:54.580 align:middle line:10%
was an opportunity for siphoning
off millions of dollars

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.240 align:middle line:10%
to invest it into
black projects.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.410 align:middle line:90%


00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:10%
They used the Antarctic Germans,
their embedded citizens,

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:10%
to great effect.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:09.410 align:middle line:10%
Because if they had a technology
that turned out-- wow,

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.440 align:middle line:10%
this has a lot of
promise, this may

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:10%
be something that
would actually work

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.290 align:middle line:10%
in a military or
civilian field, well

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:10%
they used their citizens,
both in the government

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:10%
and in the corporations, to
either close the project down

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:31.500 align:middle line:10%
publicly and take it black,
or to transfer it completely.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.940 align:middle line:10%
So that's why you end up
seeing, looking through

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.780 align:middle line:10%
the records in a Google
search, a lot of technologies

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.590 align:middle line:10%
that just, poof,
disappeared during the '60s.

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:43.565 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is why.

00:40:43.565 --> 00:40:46.690 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.750 align:middle line:10%
The AG and the
Cabal both continue

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.420 align:middle line:10%
to work on their mind
control programs.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And this includes technology,
as well as pharmaceuticals

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.950 align:middle line:10%
during the '60s.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:41:01.060 align:middle line:10%
Now keep in mind that the
World War II Germans, the Third

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:06.310 align:middle line:10%
Reich, had pioneered a lot of
things, and included among them

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.060 align:middle line:10%
were mind control.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:10%
And so the scientists, and
engineers, and doctors,

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:21.220 align:middle line:10%
and technicians that were
part of the Antarctic German

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:26.620 align:middle line:10%
society, they had and continued
their mind control programs.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.970 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Cabal wasn't
going to be turned out.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.780 align:middle line:10%
So they started their own,
which we can see and hear

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.350 align:middle line:10%
about now, some of
the disclosure that's

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:42.940 align:middle line:10%
coming about relating to
the use of LSD on prisoners,

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.270 align:middle line:10%
and they're trying and
attempts to do mind control.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's just scraping
the very surface of it.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:10%
When disclosure
happens again, we'll

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.250 align:middle line:10%
find out the full depth of how
deep this particular rabbit

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.110 align:middle line:10%
hole goes.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Now the 1960s is
also when AG built

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.850 align:middle line:10%
their new base, New Wuerzburg,
that was their second city.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:11.630 align:middle line:10%
They also were building out
their first carrier task group,

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.310 align:middle line:10%
that picture I
showed you earlier

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:19.180 align:middle line:10%
of the cigar-shaped ship,
that's one of their carriers.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:10%
The AG also expanded further
into the solar system,

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.120 align:middle line:10%
including a series--

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:32.430 align:middle line:10%
the moons around Saturn, the
Kuiper Belt, the Oort cloud.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.090 align:middle line:10%
There's so many resources
out there that all it takes

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.580 align:middle line:10%
is setting up a
base and operations.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And then you can go and
find your own small planet

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.540 align:middle line:10%
that has whatever you need.

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.870 align:middle line:10%
So that's what they were doing.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:10%
This is also the time frame that
they had obtained the Jump Gate

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:53.910 align:middle line:10%
technologies.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.520 align:middle line:10%


00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:01.230 align:middle line:10%
During this time frame was when
the five-year loaner program

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.340 align:middle line:10%
had ended.

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:10%
Now they were supposed
to return these people.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.840 align:middle line:10%
Now they weren't
kidnapped, per se.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.370 align:middle line:10%
But what happened is, that they
would return them, and then

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:19.530 align:middle line:10%
re-abduct them, or they would
write false death reports.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So they ended up keeping
about 90% of the people

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.380 align:middle line:84%
that they had acquired
from that deal.

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.220 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.000 align:middle line:10%
This is also the frame in
which the Cabal had learned

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.490 align:middle line:10%
more about some of
the threats to Earth

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:36.845 align:middle line:10%
from certain alien sectors.

00:43:36.845 --> 00:43:41.170 align:middle line:90%


00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:47.230 align:middle line:10%
Any advanced dimensional,
scalar, time, advanced physics,

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.985 align:middle line:10%
those were the projects
that were buried.

00:43:48.985 --> 00:43:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.960 align:middle line:10%
So let's get into the '70s.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.040 align:middle line:10%
The Cabal are continuing to
buy as much time as they can,

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.990 align:middle line:10%
because still they know that
number one, they're infiltrated

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:11.088 align:middle line:10%
and there's not much
they can do about it.

00:44:11.088 --> 00:44:13.130 align:middle line:10%
They tried to do something
with the McCarthy era,

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.760 align:middle line:10%
but that didn't really
work out so well.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:22.130 align:middle line:10%
Incidentally, Senator
McCarthy died three years

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:30.935 align:middle line:10%
after stopping the Red Scare,
At Bethesda Medical Center,

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:36.127 align:middle line:10%
the same place that the former
Secretary of Defense died.

00:44:36.127 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Forestall.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, forestall, that's right.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:10%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:45.380 align:middle line:10%
>> If you get sick, don't
ever go to the Bethesda.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:46.700 align:middle line:10%
No, I'm just kidding.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.233 align:middle line:10%
It apparently is a
great hospital, but--

00:44:50.233 --> 00:44:51.710 align:middle line:10%
>> If you survive the fall.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:55.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, if you
survive the fall.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.690 align:middle line:10%
The 1970s are when
the Cabal learned

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.220 align:middle line:10%
that the Antarctic Germans
had memory wipe technology.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Before then, they
hadn't known about it.

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:12.950 align:middle line:84%
So the mind wipe technology
was really on par

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.630 align:middle line:90%
with the Manhattan Project.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:21.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it allowed a
government to operate in 100%

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.570 align:middle line:84%
certainty that the
information that

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.490 align:middle line:84%
was going out with their
personnel was locked down.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to keep
people from remembering things.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.790 align:middle line:90%
So they had nothing to tell.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:39.110 align:middle line:84%
You've got nothing to tell,
you're not a security risk.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And the Cabal really
wanted that technology.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So it took them a few years,
but eventually, in 1979, they

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.680 align:middle line:84%
had a joint KGB, CIA
operation, in which they

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.440 align:middle line:84%
had gotten one of
the security forces

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Antarctic
Germans to turn.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.780 align:middle line:10%
And they acquired the
technology and made

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.670 align:middle line:10%
it look like an
accident that happened

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.210 align:middle line:10%
at altitude over the
Pacific, with nothing

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:09.800 align:middle line:10%
left in an expanding
ball of white plasma.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.680 align:middle line:10%
Now they took that and
reverse engineered it.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:18.430 align:middle line:10%
It took them a few
years to get that done.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:23.390 align:middle line:10%
1972 was also the time
frame that the Draco 25-year

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.460 align:middle line:10%
first refusal rights had ended.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:28.040 align:middle line:10%
So after that time frame,
the Antarctic Germans

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.280 align:middle line:10%
were able to keep the
technologies that they had

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.900 align:middle line:10%
acquired or were digging up.

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.590 align:middle line:10%
They reached their targeted
self-sustaining worker

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:10%
population for their
outlying colonies,

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:48.550 align:middle line:10%
their outlying manufacturing
facilities, the locations

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:51.840 align:middle line:10%
in the rest of the solar system.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.160 align:middle line:10%
The Antarctic Germans started
working on their own time

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.360 align:middle line:10%
travel.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:02.490 align:middle line:10%
What they found was
that there were problems

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.250 align:middle line:10%
with temporal interference.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:09.060 align:middle line:10%
If they messed around or
tried to monkey with timelines

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.940 align:middle line:10%
in the past, what they
found strangely enough

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.360 align:middle line:10%
was that when they go back
and try and change something

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.830 align:middle line:10%
by altering whether someone
crossed the street here

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.480 align:middle line:10%
or there, they didn't
get hit by a car.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Well, what they found was that
within a reasonable amount

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.080 align:middle line:10%
of time, the person
would die anyway,

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.560 align:middle line:10%
something else would happen.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Or the outcome that they
were trying to avoid

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.650 align:middle line:10%
would happen anyway.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:44.140 align:middle line:10%
And so now they're dealing with
multiple problems in the past.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.813 align:middle line:10%
And so they stopped, thankfully.

00:47:46.813 --> 00:47:49.230 align:middle line:10%
But I found it interesting
that that was one of the things

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.380 align:middle line:10%
that they discovered through
trying to manipulate with time,

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.540 align:middle line:10%
was that the things
that they were

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:59.807 align:middle line:10%
trying to prevent or happen
ended up happening anyway.

00:47:59.807 --> 00:48:06.280 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.590 align:middle line:10%
So 1980s, 1982
was when the Cabal

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.540 align:middle line:10%
finished their reverse
engineering of the mind

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.420 align:middle line:10%
wipe technology.

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:21.290 align:middle line:10%
The time frame that they
had built their technology

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:23.960 align:middle line:10%
for memory wipe was
also the same time frame

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.270 align:middle line:10%
that Voyager 1
and 2 were passing

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.920 align:middle line:10%
the Jupiter, Saturn area.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:33.230 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
Voyager 1 did for the Cabal was

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:36.800 align:middle line:10%
it informed to them just how
much build-out the Antarctic

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:43.340 align:middle line:10%
Germans had, just how much
infiltration alien races were

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.080 align:middle line:10%
making into our solar system.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:10%
It scared them.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.430 align:middle line:10%
They didn't realize just how
much the Antarctic Germans

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.740 align:middle line:10%
had built out.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.910 align:middle line:10%
And so they altered their
plans for world domination

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:57.555 align:middle line:10%
to speed up the timeline.

00:48:57.555 --> 00:48:59.180 align:middle line:10%
Originally they were
thinking that they

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.970 align:middle line:10%
would do it over a period
of a century or more.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, they shortened
the timeline

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.560 align:middle line:10%
to make it happen faster.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:11.360 align:middle line:10%
Now the reasons and how
they did that was by--

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.120 align:middle line:10%


00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:16.710 align:middle line:10%
you create a disease
and you create

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:10%
the cure at the same time.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:20.160 align:middle line:90%
You poison the food.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:23.430 align:middle line:84%
You dumb down the
education system.

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:27.720 align:middle line:84%
You keep promoting a
Fiat currency system.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:32.370 align:middle line:10%
You conduct false flags
so that the people

00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:37.980 align:middle line:10%
ask for more security, so
that the people are wanting

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:40.350 align:middle line:10%
to have a security state.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.980 align:middle line:10%
So eventually, that's what
they were wanting to do,

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.082 align:middle line:10%
is to get under a single,
despotic, one-world government.

00:49:48.082 --> 00:49:50.740 align:middle line:10%


00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.890 align:middle line:10%
Well, that was around
the same time frame

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.590 align:middle line:10%
that the Antarctic
Germans, around 1986,

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.270 align:middle line:10%
discovered that
their memory wipe

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:00.520 align:middle line:10%
technology had been stolen.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.080 align:middle line:10%
And they did a few things
in response to that.

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:11.020 align:middle line:10%
The destruction of the space
shuttle Challenger was one.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.650 align:middle line:10%
And then two months
later, the destruction

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:18.460 align:middle line:10%
of the cooling towers at
Chernobyl was the second one.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.040 align:middle line:10%
They also moved all
of their manufacturing

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.980 align:middle line:10%
and R&D off planet.

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:27.490 align:middle line:10%
And they sent a
plain brown paper

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:30.160 align:middle line:10%
package with a
non-operational memory

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.060 align:middle line:10%
wipe technology to the
President of the United States

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.650 align:middle line:10%
and to the president of
the Soviet Union, Mikhail

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:39.520 align:middle line:10%
Gorbachev.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.740 align:middle line:10%
Both of them got a
non-operational memory

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:47.920 align:middle line:10%
wipe device with the time, date,
and stamp from 1979 on the box.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.520 align:middle line:10%
They would have done more.

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:53.680 align:middle line:10%
But the Antarctic Germans were
worried about the cowboy US

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:58.340 align:middle line:10%
President Reagan doing,
and resulting to nukes.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.650 align:middle line:10%
So they left it at that,
plausible deniability.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:15.640 align:middle line:10%
The 1990s, the moving of
the Antarctic Germans,

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:18.430 align:middle line:10%
of the majority of their
civilization, and their R&D,

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.170 align:middle line:10%
and their manufacturing
off planet,

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:24.460 align:middle line:10%
now changes them over
to the Mars Germans.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.790 align:middle line:90%
That's my term.

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.880 align:middle line:10%
The people that I met
while deployed just

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.180 align:middle line:10%
referred to
themselves as Germans.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:38.930 align:middle line:10%
But this is just my terminology
for keeping track of it.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:44.170 align:middle line:10%
So in 1990, the Mars Germans
acquired a new property

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.270 align:middle line:10%
on the moon so that
they did not have

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.520 align:middle line:10%
to be as close to the Draco.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:53.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, their lease
originally included a clause

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that if they were
to get out of it,

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.175 align:middle line:10%
they had to find a new tenant.

00:51:57.175 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, where do you think
they found the new tenant at?

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:02.510 align:middle line:10%
The Cabal, right?

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.130 align:middle line:10%
So they didn't have to go far.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.270 align:middle line:10%
It was right there.

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:11.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, what did the Cabal have
to pay for this moon lease?

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:17.690 align:middle line:10%
Well, they ended up paying
for the moon lease with 25,000

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:22.670 align:middle line:10%
ground troops so that the
Mars Germans could use them

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:26.113 align:middle line:10%
for border control.

00:52:26.113 --> 00:52:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, what that
turned out to mean

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.710 align:middle line:90%
was the conquering of planets.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:35.450 align:middle line:10%
So in order for the Cabal
to get their moon base,

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:38.050 align:middle line:10%
they provided 25,000 troops.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, where did they come from?

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.820 align:middle line:10%
Well, they came
from every country

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.040 align:middle line:10%
on the planet that
has a central bank.

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.100 align:middle line:10%
So 1991 was when the
Cabal and the Mars Germans

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.740 align:middle line:10%
signed the cooperative
action treaty

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.450 align:middle line:10%
for the Cabal takeover
of the moon base,

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.050 align:middle line:10%
as well as the
creation of IDARF,

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.910 align:middle line:10%
the Intergalactic Defense And
Reaction Forces, the fleet,

00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.700 align:middle line:10%
the SSP program that
I was involved in.

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for bearing
with me through all

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that to get to this point of
how we got there for IDARF.

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.490 align:middle line:10%
I think we went
through that already.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:10%


00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:30.330 align:middle line:10%
The earth units were split
into two separate groups.

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.470 align:middle line:84%
There was the Third Panzer
Division and the Fourth Panzer

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:34.370 align:middle line:90%
Division.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:36.470 align:middle line:10%
Now the unit that
I was a part of

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:39.080 align:middle line:10%
was the Third Panzer Division.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:44.660 align:middle line:10%
And we were told that
we would be helping

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:47.990 align:middle line:10%
indigenous populations
defend their planet

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:52.880 align:middle line:10%
from an alien aggressor that
was there to wipe them out.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.680 align:middle line:10%
Now what we didn't realize
was that the alien aggressors,

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.680 align:middle line:10%
as well as our own forces,
were being controlled

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.440 align:middle line:10%
and manipulated by the Draco.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.170 align:middle line:10%
They were controlling
both sides of it.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:14.610 align:middle line:10%
An idea on the patches for
the Third and Fourth Panzer

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.410 align:middle line:10%
Division, and
everybody from Earth

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:19.520 align:middle line:10%
had the center one
to identify them.

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:10%
Now, again, as I mentioned
just a minute ago,

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:30.630 align:middle line:10%
the propaganda that
they spread was

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.715 align:middle line:10%
that IDARF was there to
help other planets fight off

00:54:33.715 --> 00:54:34.515 align:middle line:10%
invasion.

00:54:34.515 --> 00:54:36.295 align:middle line:84%
Now who wouldn't
want to do that?

00:54:36.295 --> 00:54:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Sure as service to
others, we're going

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.920 align:middle line:84%
to help them defend
their home turf.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:43.920 align:middle line:10%
Well, if they had
told us the truth,

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.850 align:middle line:10%
was that we were all operating
under the same command

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:55.320 align:middle line:10%
structure, then they would
have had major, major mutinies.

00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:58.200 align:middle line:10%
There would have been a
lot of fighting internally.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.030 align:middle line:10%
And I think that it would have
turned out very differently.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:04.060 align:middle line:10%
So they did not tell the truth.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.340 align:middle line:10%
Again, more of those lies.

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.310 align:middle line:10%


00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:10.890 align:middle line:10%
So my involvement in IDARF.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:15.410 align:middle line:10%
The first 18 months were
locked up in training.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:10%
The training
included eight months

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.280 align:middle line:10%
at an underground
facility that was

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.440 align:middle line:10%
referred to as the FIG, the Fort
Indiantown Gap cave structure.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:34.650 align:middle line:10%
Now if you can imagine something
the size of an NFL stadium

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:39.150 align:middle line:10%
underground, with
that much open space.

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:43.650 align:middle line:10%
Probably another
five or six stories

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.140 align:middle line:10%
above that-- we weren't
allowed in that area

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:50.380 align:middle line:10%
because they claimed
it was radioactive.

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:54.030 align:middle line:10%
But it was at least
32 stories high.

00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.860 align:middle line:10%
So it's a big structure
and it's all underground.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:59.610 align:middle line:10%
It was essentially
a small city so

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.665 align:middle line:10%
that we would have
the space in the room

00:56:01.665 --> 00:56:03.540 align:middle line:10%
to do all the training
and everything that we

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.290 align:middle line:10%
needed to do.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:09.030 align:middle line:10%
So the first eight
months were when we

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.750 align:middle line:10%
learned how to work with our--

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:16.590 align:middle line:10%
work with our own nanite
enhancement therapies.

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.500 align:middle line:84%
The next six months,
we spent on the moon,

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.590 align:middle line:84%
learning about shipboard
operations, firefighting,

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:26.820 align:middle line:90%
to where is the can at.

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:29.363 align:middle line:84%
It takes time for
ground troops to learn

00:56:29.363 --> 00:56:30.780 align:middle line:84%
all the different
things that they

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.150 align:middle line:84%
need to do in order to
get deployed from a ship

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.527 align:middle line:90%
to the ground.

00:56:34.527 --> 00:56:36.360 align:middle line:10%
And then the last four
months of my training

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.320 align:middle line:10%
was spent on Mars, in which we
were doing combat deployment

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.290 align:middle line:10%
training.

00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And it was essentially
life in a suit,

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.470 align:middle line:10%
life in a combat suit for
those last four months.

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:50.500 align:middle line:90%


00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:57.300 align:middle line:10%
Here's a picture of the FIG,
an idea of just how big it was.

00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:59.460 align:middle line:10%
Around the top of
the facility there

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:05.890 align:middle line:10%
were these steel platforms
that they used to great effect.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.560 align:middle line:10%
I remember when I
first walked in,

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:10%
and I would see up
to 175 feet of rope

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:15.565 align:middle line:10%
with the carabiner at the
end, just kind of dangling

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.780 align:middle line:10%
and moving around.

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.260 align:middle line:10%
It was very surreal
because it is like they

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.700 align:middle line:10%
each had their own frequencies.

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.820 align:middle line:10%
And so my first thought, why
do they have trapeze training?

00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.180 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out that it
was an anti-gravitic training.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And so you have to go
through the process.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.395 align:middle line:90%
And the lines were for safety.

00:57:34.395 --> 00:57:38.730 align:middle line:90%


00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:40.070 align:middle line:90%
It was essentially a small city.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.895 align:middle line:90%
It included a range.

00:57:41.895 --> 00:57:45.980 align:middle line:84%
It included hand-to-hand combat
areas, hand-to-hand training,

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:48.630 align:middle line:90%
classrooms.

00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the first eight
months of our training

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:57.420 align:middle line:84%
involved learning how to use our
nanite enhancement therapies.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And there's a technique
that is a biofeedback, where

00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:10.030 align:middle line:84%
you are able to identify
every part of your body,

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and which parts, and
what feels like what.

00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:17.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, if you've got a small
cyst on one of your knuckles,

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.240 align:middle line:10%
you'll know exactly
what that feels like.

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.290 align:middle line:10%
That allows you to use the
nanite enhancement therapies

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:26.990 align:middle line:10%
to great effect
for muscle control,

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:30.140 align:middle line:10%
for being able to turn
on the night vision,

00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:33.290 align:middle line:10%
for being able to turn on
the auditory enhancements,

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.430 align:middle line:10%
for being able to turn down
the need for sleep, for being

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.070 align:middle line:10%
able to turn off
the need for food,

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:43.390 align:middle line:10%
so that you don't get
the growling stomach.

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:46.850 align:middle line:10%
So the majority of the--

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:49.340 align:middle line:10%
I'd say the biggest piece
of our initial training

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:54.920 align:middle line:10%
was incorporating the nanite
enhancement therapies.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:59.300 align:middle line:10%
Now after finishing
up the training,

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:05.160 align:middle line:10%
we were deployed to what I'm
referring to as Planet 1.

00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.650 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't recall the
name of this planet.

00:59:09.650 --> 00:59:17.030 align:middle line:10%
But this was where we came up
against the werewolf hybrids.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:19.100 align:middle line:10%
They are eight to
nine feet tall.

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:23.270 align:middle line:10%
And a mechanical
biological being,

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:27.050 align:middle line:10%
they had hoses and different
mechanical parts that were

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:28.880 align:middle line:10%
exposed through their skin.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.520 align:middle line:90%


00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:37.480 align:middle line:84%
They carried a bladed
projectile weapon with them

00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.800 align:middle line:84%
that was a cryogenically
operated projectile weapon.

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.810 align:middle line:84%
That was-- before we
get into destruction,

00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to
concentrate on that.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:53.150 align:middle line:84%
The type of planet
that this was,

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:57.710 align:middle line:84%
where we were
stationed at, reminds

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:03.200 align:middle line:84%
me a lot of Holland, in that
the canals were the main method

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.330 align:middle line:90%
for moving around the city.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.670 align:middle line:84%
So there were canals
everywhere in the cities

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.468 align:middle line:90%
that we were deployed to.

01:00:09.468 --> 01:00:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So that gives you an idea
of what they look like.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:13.070 align:middle line:90%
These pictures are from Holland.

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you a good
idea of what they look like,

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
as well as what the hybrid
werewolves looked like.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Now the planet was about
2% larger than Earth.

01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:35.145 align:middle line:84%
It had 60% landmass and
40% freshwater, two moons.

01:00:35.145 --> 01:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%


01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I want to get through this so
we can get to some question

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:44.930 align:middle line:90%
and answer.

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Planet 2, which is Caladus
3, is the name of the planet

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.950 align:middle line:90%
that I have recalled.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.050 align:middle line:90%
That was our next deployment.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And we were there for 67 months.

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Now these are the
spider-bear like hybrids.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.005 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are created beings
specifically for a purpose.

01:01:06.005 --> 01:01:08.680 align:middle line:90%


01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
They included
anti-gravity within

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
their biological
mechanical makeup,

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.790 align:middle line:84%
so that they were able to
change directions, alter

01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:20.680 align:middle line:90%
their line of attack on a dime.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%


01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:30.010 align:middle line:10%
This planet, Caladus
3, had a 32-hour day,

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:33.070 align:middle line:10%
and it was about the
same size as Earth,

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:36.760 align:middle line:10%
maybe 4% or 5% larger.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.790 align:middle line:10%
This landmass on
Planet 2 had about 70%

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:45.100 align:middle line:10%
land and 30% freshwater,
again freshwater, no salt.

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.500 align:middle line:10%
This one had four moons.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:52.750 align:middle line:10%
And the black moon
that was there,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.050 align:middle line:10%
we had named Waldo because
it was so hard to find.

01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:57.880 align:middle line:10%
So the joke was where's Waldo.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.660 align:middle line:90%


01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The settlements were all
below 50 degrees latitude.

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:10.870 align:middle line:10%
And none were ever
built over 60 degrees.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.960 align:middle line:10%
The population of
about 4 billion

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.860 align:middle line:10%
when we made our first landfall.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:23.710 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, that
was severely decreased.

01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Their civilization was at about
the start of the Industrial

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Revolution equivalent
here on Earth.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.190 align:middle line:10%
So they had some
technologies, but again think

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:37.400 align:middle line:10%
gauges, and steam, and tubes.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.850 align:middle line:10%
But nothing compared to
modern advanced technologies.

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:46.690 align:middle line:10%
Their governments were
locally organized and run,

01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:51.730 align:middle line:10%
either a village, or town
elder, or town elders.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:55.420 align:middle line:10%
They did not have
large countries

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.860 align:middle line:10%
under a single government.

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:12.992 align:middle line:90%


01:03:12.992 --> 01:03:13.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to skip that.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.790 align:middle line:90%


01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
The parts I'm skipping have to
do with the destruction, death,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
and fighting.

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
The third planet that we went
to, I was there for 15 months.

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
This was the first
planet encountered

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:37.100 align:middle line:84%
that had more than
just a humanoid race.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:41.270 align:middle line:84%
This planet also had a
cyclopean race as well as

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
an insectoid kind of race.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:49.730 align:middle line:10%
Now the cyclopean looked
just like regular humanoids,

01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:52.040 align:middle line:10%
except for the single eye.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:56.840 align:middle line:10%
And they were also
somewhat telepathic.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:02.990 align:middle line:10%
Now the insectoid race
was very telepathic in how

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:04.770 align:middle line:10%
they communicated.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.180 align:middle line:10%
They were not
telekinetic or some

01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.760 align:middle line:10%
of the other psychological
or psych abilities,

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:14.187 align:middle line:10%
but they communicated
telepathically.

01:04:14.187 --> 01:04:17.110 align:middle line:10%


01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:18.820 align:middle line:10%
The first 15 months
we were there,

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:22.675 align:middle line:10%
again our MO was to help
the civilian government

01:04:22.675 --> 01:04:25.520 align:middle line:10%
and the civilian
population get organized,

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.720 align:middle line:10%
help them build up their stores,
help them to create a defense

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.480 align:middle line:10%
industry so that they could
supply their own people

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.640 align:middle line:10%
with weapons that they needed.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And so our mission on
this particular planet

01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:40.450 align:middle line:10%
was challenging
beyond what we had

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:44.140 align:middle line:10%
experienced before, because
of the presence of the two

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.010 align:middle line:10%
other races.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:48.520 align:middle line:10%
They had already been fighting
and warring with each other

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.650 align:middle line:10%
for over a century.

01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:54.020 align:middle line:10%
And so they didn't
trust each other.

01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.020 align:middle line:10%
And that made our
job a lot harder,

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:01.220 align:middle line:10%
because we had to get them all
pulling in the same direction

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.950 align:middle line:10%
if they were going to survive.

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.610 align:middle line:10%
Well, it just so happens
that the insectoids didn't

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:09.490 align:middle line:10%
trust any humans or humanoids.

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.000 align:middle line:10%
And there were incidents
that started happening.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.640 align:middle line:10%
Because again, we were trying
to get them to get on board.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.040 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't like
some of the things

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.900 align:middle line:10%
that the leadership was doing.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.467 align:middle line:10%
And they struck back.

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:27.550 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
they ended up striking back

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:31.630 align:middle line:10%
was a shuttle that I happened
to be on at one time.

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:35.200 align:middle line:10%
The medical injuries I sustained
during that shuttle crash

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.820 align:middle line:10%
were too much.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:40.430 align:middle line:10%
And the local medical
facilities weren't enough.

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:43.630 align:middle line:10%
So I was shipped back
to Mars for 11 months

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.690 align:middle line:10%
of regeneration
therapies and recovery.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:51.010 align:middle line:10%
And also learning to use my
nanite enhancements again

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.680 align:middle line:10%
and the new limbs
that I had been given.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:59.410 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:04.980 align:middle line:10%
When those 11 months of medical
treatment and relearning

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.230 align:middle line:10%
were over, I was sent
back to Caladus 3

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.690 align:middle line:10%
to help with the
rebuilding efforts.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.730 align:middle line:10%
And it gave me a
chance, an opportunity

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:16.380 align:middle line:10%
to see what happened after
the war, what they were doing.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.850 align:middle line:10%
And the war period,
they were very

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:25.020 align:middle line:10%
strict on the use of additional
advanced technologies.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.200 align:middle line:10%
And what that means is,
they wouldn't let us use it.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.500 align:middle line:10%
Now, I realized later
the reason for that

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:36.990 align:middle line:10%
was because they were trying to
get the losses as high as they

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:39.780 align:middle line:10%
could before they
started allowing

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.990 align:middle line:10%
the use of advanced
technologies.

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:48.810 align:middle line:10%
After the war, Caladus 3,
it was just the opposite,

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:53.040 align:middle line:10%
how fast can we get to a
super advanced technology.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.080 align:middle line:10%
And they opened all the gates.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, this turned their
civilization upside down.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.870 align:middle line:10%
Because their religious
beliefs, and they

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:11.760 align:middle line:10%
had their own versions, their
family structures, their town

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:17.550 align:middle line:10%
structures, it forced
them to change the way

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:20.280 align:middle line:10%
that they did things
from a family level

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.910 align:middle line:10%
on up through the top
of their civilization.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:27.460 align:middle line:10%
Now surprisingly enough,
when I got back to Caladus 3,

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.640 align:middle line:10%
I also learned
that there had been

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:35.640 align:middle line:10%
a number of families
that were given charge

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.540 align:middle line:10%
of certain geographical areas.

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.030 align:middle line:10%
Now sounds awful familiar.

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:47.880 align:middle line:10%
There are a number of families
here on Earth that have,

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.800 align:middle line:10%
shall we say
responsibilities that they

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.560 align:middle line:10%
feel that they are entitled to.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.770 align:middle line:10%
What it turned out
that was happening

01:07:57.770 --> 01:08:01.970 align:middle line:10%
through these false flags
was they were setting up

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:03.650 align:middle line:10%
Cabal operations.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:07.595 align:middle line:10%
If you can imagine a--

01:08:07.595 --> 01:08:08.890 align:middle line:10%
oh, what's it called--

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:11.440 align:middle line:10%


01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.540 align:middle line:10%
they were trying to
set up the planet

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:17.109 align:middle line:10%
for a Cabal-like operation.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to
wait 100 years or more

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to reach a single
world government.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.080 align:middle line:90%
So they sped it up.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.370 align:middle line:90%
They made it go faster.

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
That was the reason behind
the war and all the losses.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:37.260 align:middle line:10%
Because these people were
willing to agree to the terms,

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.791 align:middle line:10%
because the alternative
was defeat and extinction.

01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:47.410 align:middle line:90%


01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:52.100 align:middle line:10%
That was quite a
realization to come to.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.250 align:middle line:10%
And that the whole purpose
was to speed up the one world

01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:01.740 align:middle line:10%
government process by the
techniques that they used.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.899 align:middle line:10%
They didn't have
to wait 100 years.

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:05.189 align:middle line:10%
They did it in about 10.

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:09.810 align:middle line:90%


01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:16.300 align:middle line:10%
Now when I was there, I was able
to help them rebuild, help them

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.819 align:middle line:10%
to build orbital facilities.

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:24.640 align:middle line:10%
I recall standing on the
observation deck of one

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.330 align:middle line:10%
in particular, in which it
was a large glass wall--

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.130 align:middle line:10%
and when I say glass,
it's transparent

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:33.790 align:middle line:10%
steel and which was looking
out over the planet.

01:09:33.790 --> 01:09:38.680 align:middle line:10%
And I could remember looking out
and seeing lights on the shadow

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.130 align:middle line:10%
areas and seeing the rest
of the planet lit up,

01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:47.310 align:middle line:10%
and feeling like I was
standing on the edge of space.

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:48.863 align:middle line:10%
It was unimaginable.

01:09:48.863 --> 01:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%


01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:57.870 align:middle line:10%
We completed a lot of missions
in which we were bringing

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:01.710 align:middle line:10%
people from the
sticks, or the boonies,

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:08.700 align:middle line:10%
or from the extremely rural
areas and helping them to make

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:13.860 align:middle line:10%
their way into more urbanized
areas so that the governments

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.110 align:middle line:10%
that had been set up,
those 12 families,

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:20.100 align:middle line:10%
could provide a place for
them to work-- how nice--

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:25.980 align:middle line:10%
food, and water, and shelter,
and taxes, and Fiat currency,

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and all the other things
that came with it.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.220 align:middle line:10%
Now I did that for 26 months
before my next deployment,

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:40.700 align:middle line:10%
which was returning
to be a trainer.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.940 align:middle line:10%
The policy of IDARF
is that they do not

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:48.950 align:middle line:10%
allow any trainers, any people,
any soldiers to become trainers

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:52.550 align:middle line:10%
unless they have served at
least one combat deployment.

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And their reasoning is
actually quite simple.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.330 align:middle line:10%
It's combat Darwinism.

01:10:56.330 --> 01:11:00.950 align:middle line:10%
If you survive, then you
are eligible or can teach.

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:06.140 align:middle line:10%
So I went back to
the 333rd training

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:11.270 align:middle line:10%
regiment in which I was
helping to train new soldiers.

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:16.590 align:middle line:10%
One of the questions I get is,
well, how did that work out?

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:18.050 align:middle line:10%
What did you think about that?

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, that was around
the time that I

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:23.870 align:middle line:10%
had started putting pieces
together and realizing

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:27.500 align:middle line:10%
the duplicity of
the false flags.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:31.850 align:middle line:10%
And so I had mixed feelings.

01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:38.180 align:middle line:10%
Because here I am helping to
train these soldiers to go out

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.840 align:middle line:10%
and to do the same
things that I had done

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.890 align:middle line:10%
to help defend these planets.

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And I was, on one hand,
very proud of the soldiers,

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.440 align:middle line:10%
and what they had
done, and overcome,

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.650 align:middle line:10%
and the training that
they had accomplished,

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:59.460 align:middle line:10%
and all of the many things
that they were able to do.

01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:04.700 align:middle line:10%
But I was not happy about
it because of the duplicity

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.450 align:middle line:10%
of what was involved.

01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:13.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I had spoken
out, they probably

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:17.080 align:middle line:10%
would have my mind
wiped the memory from me

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.640 align:middle line:10%
so that I would continue
on as a non-troubling,

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.390 align:middle line:10%
a non-problem soldier.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:28.210 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't recall
if that had happened.

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:32.110 align:middle line:10%
But knowing myself,
and I think that that

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:35.080 align:middle line:10%
is one of the challenges
that we are faced with,

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.670 align:middle line:10%
is know yourself,
and knowing myself,

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:40.000 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't have been
able to stay quiet.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, one of the deals is
that in order for them

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.420 align:middle line:10%
to use some of the
technologies, they

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.960 align:middle line:10%
had to do everything
within their power

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:55.120 align:middle line:10%
to return each of the soldiers
back to their departure time

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.370 align:middle line:10%
and place, which meant they
couldn't space me or get

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.220 align:middle line:10%
rid of inconvenient problems.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
What it means is
that they would have

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
used a mind wipe
technology to help

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.760 align:middle line:90%
erase those nagging problems.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.890 align:middle line:90%


01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wrong direction.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:24.130 align:middle line:90%


01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:31.590 align:middle line:10%
OK, at this point, I would
like to open up for questions.

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.950 align:middle line:10%
I know that the
time that we had,

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:39.780 align:middle line:10%
I really had to blast
through it quickly.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.264 align:middle line:90%
So, yes--

01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:43.755 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you prepare--

01:13:43.755 --> 01:13:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you prepare for your
brain after the mind wipe.

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:59.925 align:middle line:10%
And had you had any after
effects from the limbs that

01:13:59.925 --> 01:14:00.870 align:middle line:10%
were regrown?

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.740 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't hear
it, the outcome

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:12.450 align:middle line:84%
of taking care of your mind and
the changes in the limbs that

01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:13.250 align:middle line:90%
were replaced.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%


01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:19.170 align:middle line:10%
You know, Randy
Cramer said it nicely,

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:22.950 align:middle line:10%
when he said it's a
20-year process of healing.

01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:25.840 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't agree more.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And that the mental
process of going through

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to healing and
clearing the traumas

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
is going to be individualized
for each person.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And there are thousands of
SSP experiencers of volunteers

01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:45.510 align:middle line:84%
out there that have gone
through some version of the SSP

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and have had their
minds tinkered with.

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Now your question
about the limbs,

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
restless leg, restless arm

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.385 align:middle line:84%
syndrome is present in the
limbs that were replaced.

01:14:57.385 --> 01:15:01.840 align:middle line:90%


01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So this all started on Earth?

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm still a
little unclear as to what

01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the motivation is for this Cabal
to go from planet to planet

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:22.031 align:middle line:84%
and ostensibly looking like
you're helping the people

01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:25.800 align:middle line:90%
of these various planets.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:27.792 align:middle line:90%
What's in it for them?

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Is it a resource-based thing?

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.096 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get something
tangible for Fiat money

01:15:33.096 --> 01:15:34.630 align:middle line:90%
or it's not worth the effort.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:36.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:15:36.212 --> 01:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you talk about
the economics and stuff--

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, that a great question.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The Cabal were not the
ones calling the shots.

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
It was the Draco and
their bosses, the AI,

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that were
ultimately calling the shots.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
They were franchising evil
is what they were doing.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Cabal weren't
involved with the control

01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.820 align:middle line:90%
over those planets.

01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.470 align:middle line:84%
But they had to provide soldiers
to pay for the Earth Moon base

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:07.320 align:middle line:90%
that they had taken over.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.100 align:middle line:90%
So does that answer?

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
The economics of
what was involved

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:19.950 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the AI and the
Draco wanting to gain control

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
over additional populations.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.120 align:middle line:90%
They were using--

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.260 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE] to do that.

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, all right, so, yeah,
all right, well, all right,

01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.570 align:middle line:90%
I got a few more questions.

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you able to talk a
little bit more about some

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.920 align:middle line:90%
of the technology [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.360 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.240 align:middle line:90%
>> The what?

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.040 align:middle line:90%
The last one?

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The shuttle being
taken out by the--

01:16:52.170 --> 01:16:56.640 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yes, the shuttle
being knocked out.

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Medical technologies and
nanite enhancement therapies,

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.690 align:middle line:84%
when I first received that
shot, it was the second day

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
that I was in the FIG.

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
The medical end processing
that I went through,

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:16.100 align:middle line:84%
I guess I had expected
it to look like mercury

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.880 align:middle line:90%
in a shot, a hypodermic needle.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was kind of cloudy.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It was very-- it just
looked like cloud liquid.

01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
What it does is the
base level of nanites

01:17:29.010 --> 01:17:35.550 align:middle line:84%
go in because they are created
with a generic DNA structure.

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
the nanites have to do

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
is they have to go in
and create a foundation

01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:48.600 align:middle line:84%
in which the
soldier's DNA is then

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:54.550 align:middle line:84%
used to create the various
systems that the nanites need.

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:55.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, they created
what appeared to be

01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
circuitry on the outside of
the eyes that didn't affect

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.810 align:middle line:84%
the vision negatively, but it
gave us the ability to zoom,

01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.100 align:middle line:90%
as well as night vision.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.620 align:middle line:90%


01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Every single gland in
the body was altered.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So that you could
control your sleep.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, the biofeedback that
I had mentioned earlier,

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:25.290 align:middle line:84%
in which you're able
to isolate and control

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:27.930 align:middle line:84%
different portions of
your body, because they

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:31.060 align:middle line:84%
were able to, during
the learning process,

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
they were able to, for lack
of a better way of putting it,

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
make a certain area either
electrically shocked or vibrate

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
from the nanites, so that
you could identify it--

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
OK, that that's
such an such gland.

01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
If there was no sensory organs
there, then what they would do

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.670 align:middle line:84%
is they would create a
chain from the location

01:18:56.670 --> 01:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
with no nerves, so
that you could then

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.400 align:middle line:84%
have a created
pathway in which you

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.570 align:middle line:90%
could identify glands, tissue.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:12.310 align:middle line:84%
You could focus your nanites to
a particular part on the body

01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:16.890 align:middle line:84%
so that the healing
process would speed up.

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:20.310 align:middle line:84%
The nanite
enhancement therapies,

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:23.730 align:middle line:84%
the way that it was
first explained to me,

01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and having seen it through
my own experiences,

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:34.720 align:middle line:84%
was that it gave the soldiers
the best chances for survival.

01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So that hopefully, I
hope that answers your--

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Mind wipe.

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:42.460 align:middle line:90%


01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, well we've
got five minutes left.

01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:47.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:48.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Good evening.

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:50.820 align:middle line:84%
You kind of touched
on this already.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to get your
opinion on if you're

01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
for drip-drip disclosure
or full disclosure now.

01:19:56.550 --> 01:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, you know, one of the
things about the drip-drip

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
disclosure is that
it's taking forever.

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the problem with it.

01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other side of that is
having seen a civilization get

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.030 align:middle line:84%
turned upside down
because of technology

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
being injected into it,
that's not something

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that I would want my
brothers, and sisters,

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and loved ones to go through.

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the disclosure plan
that's being acted out

01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and carried out
right now was made

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
by the very people that
kept it secret from us

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.570 align:middle line:90%
for 80-plus years.

01:20:39.570 --> 01:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The same people
that kept it secret

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:43.250 align:middle line:90%
developed this disclosure plan.

01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And what is it?

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the disclosure plan
is to release technology

01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:51.200 align:middle line:84%
that, by the way we have already
paid for through black budget

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.150 align:middle line:84%
projects, to companies
and universities

01:20:54.150 --> 01:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
so that they can release or
discover this new technology,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
like transparent steel, like
a neural interface for three

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
separate drones, those
kinds of discoveries.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.440 align:middle line:84%
That is the
drip-drip disclosure.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.400 align:middle line:84%
What I would like to see
happen and working on

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:20.750 align:middle line:84%
is a crowdsourced, transparent,
civilian involved transition

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.160 align:middle line:90%
process.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
The people that made that plan
that we're seeing right now--

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, thank you for holding the
helm for the last 80 years,

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
and lying to us, and
keeping truth from us.

01:21:33.050 --> 01:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
This is where I think that the
people need to get involved

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.230 align:middle line:90%
and to develop.

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to have to
cover medical, transportation,

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.330 align:middle line:90%
environmental, power.

01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Once we reach advanced
technologies on power,

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
guess what, the power
industry is now obsolete.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So what are the workers,
the millions of people

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that work for power
company's going to do?

01:21:57.110 --> 01:22:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, they get transitioned
into another job.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:04.640 align:middle line:84%
They have to do-- well, that's
what we need to figure out.

01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
That's the kind of thing
that I'm working on and one

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:12.250 align:middle line:84%
of the projects that
I'm working through.

01:22:12.250 --> 01:22:13.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:22:13.050 --> 01:22:14.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:18.490 align:middle line:84%
So to answer your question,
I'd like to have it quick.

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:23.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think that we need
to get more people involved

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:24.690 align:middle line:90%
with that process.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't want their plan.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.680 align:middle line:90%
I want our developed plan.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.840 align:middle line:90%


01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just curious about
the time that you were away,

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the time that you were away,
did you make friends among

01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:41.390 align:middle line:90%
your fellow comrades in arms?

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> And so, are they out now too?

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.330 align:middle line:90%


01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:51.280 align:middle line:90%
>> There are about--

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.070 align:middle line:84%
after they established and got
the program up and running,

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
there are about 5,000 a year
that transition in and out.

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the similarity
between the friends

01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:05.170 align:middle line:84%
that I had in the US
Army Corps of Engineers

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and the friends
that I had in IDARF

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.960 align:middle line:90%
was that, yes, you make friends.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:18.400 align:middle line:84%
As an officer, they didn't
want us to interact too much.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And that same thing
applies to the US army.

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:23.500 align:middle line:84%
They keep a separation
between officers

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and enlisted because of the need
to maintain positive control

01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:29.710 align:middle line:90%
over command structure.

01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:31.780 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I did
make some friends.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I made some people that I
didn't recall, or don't recall

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:38.660 align:middle line:90%
and haven't run into.

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I've got one person that
I knew from my deployments

01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not sure if
this person is awake yet.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in
free will and I'm not

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:56.980 align:middle line:90%
going to force that on somebody.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And one other
quick question is,

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
you say that they think these
plans out and they go for 100

01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:02.980 align:middle line:90%
years out.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:04.907 align:middle line:84%
But the ones who are
setting up these plans

01:24:04.907 --> 01:24:06.490 align:middle line:84%
are not going to be
here in 100 years.

01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:24:07.290 --> 01:24:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Or are they?

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Do they just reincarnate
into the same families,

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.730 align:middle line:84%
like they did the 12
families, they just kind of--

01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:14.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great question.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.350 align:middle line:84%
My thoughts on that are
the medical technologies

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.350 align:middle line:84%
are sufficient enough
that they can extend

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:24.430 align:middle line:90%
the life to 150, 180 years.

01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So the very people
that are making those

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:35.740 align:middle line:84%
plans at the top, the ones that
die, my suspicion is that they

01:24:35.740 --> 01:24:40.330 align:middle line:84%
are either moved off
planet so that they're

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.940 align:middle line:84%
no longer within the
public realm here,

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and are still alive.

01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Or the consciousness
transfer technology,

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
in which they're able to
relocate a consciousness

01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:54.880 align:middle line:90%
into a new body.

01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:02.070 align:middle line:90%


01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I was just curious
about the timelines

01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that you listed for how
long you were deployed.

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Is that in earth time?

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.850 align:middle line:90%
As that in interplanetary time?

01:25:10.850 --> 01:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
Or are they the same?

01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The time dilation, depending
on where you're at--

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.600 align:middle line:84%
let me start by saying
that time is an illusion.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can take a
test in which you

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:27.952 align:middle line:84%
have a clock on the
top of a mountain.

01:25:27.952 --> 01:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It's going to read
different than a clock

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:31.610 align:middle line:90%
at the base of the mountain.

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:33.590 align:middle line:84%
If you've got enough
accuracy on that clock,

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:37.040 align:middle line:90%
you can measure that difference.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So the side real time
that I was deployed,

01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
would have been
close to Earth time.

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
So the months of deployment
would have been close to that.

01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:54.890 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, thank you.

01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:57.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:25:57.893 --> 01:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, thank you for
sharing your story.

01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:26:01.650 --> 01:26:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned all these
planets that you were deployed

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.590 align:middle line:90%
on and all these various wars.

01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Did you have interactions
that you can remember

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.050 align:middle line:90%
with the native people?

01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And could you possibly
describe some of those?

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure, great question.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:24.030 align:middle line:84%
The interactions that
we had with the natives,

01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
we had to work very
closely with them,

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:28.230 align:middle line:84%
because again, we were
helping to train them.

01:26:28.230 --> 01:26:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And so you think
about the mission that

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is publicized of
the special forces

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
within the Western
militaries, they

01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:40.170 align:middle line:84%
are trainers of
indigenous populations.

01:26:40.170 --> 01:26:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had the same mission
with the indigenous populations

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.230 align:middle line:90%
on these planets.

01:26:46.230 --> 01:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
There were cases where we would
sleep out in the same area.

01:26:50.670 --> 01:26:54.480 align:middle line:84%
We were basically
embedded in their units

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.140 align:middle line:90%
to serve as one combined unit.

01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:01.440 align:middle line:90%
We got to know them very well.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Similar to getting
to know somebody

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that you're training
with for years

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:09.120 align:middle line:90%
or fighting alongside for years.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.600 align:middle line:90%
We were involved with lots of--

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:17.280 align:middle line:84%
one particular mission in
which one of the tactics

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
that they used was to melt
the Arctic and Antarctic ice

01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
on those planets so that they
would raise the sea levels

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.070 align:middle line:90%
to flood out coastal areas.

01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And this particular
cave city that we

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
were helping to clear out was
under threat of being flooded.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And we worked with the
city, the village elders,

01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
essentially, to help
relocate all those people

01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:49.380 align:middle line:90%
to a high and dry place.

01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Incidentally, one of the
little kids ended up staying

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and had to go get found
by some of our troops.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Were these human like people?

01:28:00.330 --> 01:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> They are humanoid, yes,
looks and appearances just like

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the human
population here.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:10.890 align:middle line:90%
They have dark hair, light hair.

01:28:10.890 --> 01:28:17.310 align:middle line:84%
The size and height were
a little bit smaller,

01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:19.436 align:middle line:90%
generally speaking.

01:28:19.436 --> 01:28:20.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:28:20.236 --> 01:28:23.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:28:23.652 --> 01:28:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Hey, Jason, thanks so
much for everything you do.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to speak
with the fellow SSP

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
insider or experiencer,
what advice

01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:33.860 align:middle line:84%
would you give them
towards helping them maybe

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:35.235 align:middle line:84%
recall some memories
or integrate

01:28:35.235 --> 01:28:37.027 align:middle line:84%
some of their experiences,
if they're still

01:28:37.027 --> 01:28:38.960 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning and
their awakening process?

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Or would you say that's
a mistaken effort

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:42.443 align:middle line:84%
to do that intentionally,
rather than having

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:45.500 align:middle line:84%
them recover those memories
naturally on their own?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, that's
a great question.

01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:50.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I went
through when I first

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.040 align:middle line:84%
started recalling was, darn it,
I want to remember everything.

01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, like
I said earlier,

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
careful what you wish for,
careful what you proclaim.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.720 align:middle line:84%
There are some things that
I wish I hadn't remembered.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I think trust the
process, seek out answers.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The advice that I would give
to somebody is to do research.

01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:21.260 align:middle line:90%
Do spiritual research.

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:24.380 align:middle line:90%
Do information research.

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The path that I
followed for awakening

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:31.710 align:middle line:84%
is going to be different
than everybody else.

01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:33.800 align:middle line:90%
It's an individual path.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And what I can tell you is
that the path that I followed--

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.510 align:middle line:84%
for instance, I would
go online looking

01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:45.970 align:middle line:84%
for information on, I'll
just pull something random,

01:29:45.970 --> 01:29:47.905 align:middle line:90%
a name, a German name.

01:29:47.905 --> 01:29:49.490 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know where it was.

01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:52.282 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know where to find it.

01:29:52.282 --> 01:29:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I would start
looking, random stuff.

01:29:56.490 --> 01:30:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the ships
that was used as a landmark

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:06.350 align:middle line:84%
during our training was
the SS Schwabenland.

01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now allegedly, it was
sunk by the allies

01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:11.690 align:middle line:84%
after it had been filled
up with chemical weapons

01:30:11.690 --> 01:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in a deep, dark
place of the Atlantic.

01:30:14.610 --> 01:30:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, number one,
there weren't a lot

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.230 align:middle line:84%
of chemical weapons in
World War II, enough

01:30:18.230 --> 01:30:20.690 align:middle line:90%
to fill a ship this size.

01:30:20.690 --> 01:30:23.860 align:middle line:90%
Number two, it's alleged sunk--

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:28.610 align:middle line:84%
its alleged location is still
a national security secret.

01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, this ship, I saw
it when we were training.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:32.960 align:middle line:90%
They used it as a landmark.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing
random searches,

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.300 align:middle line:84%
I found the image of that
ship and knew immediately,

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.520 align:middle line:90%
that's the ship.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Now I did 1930's
cargo ship searches.

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:51.780 align:middle line:90%
The process may take time.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.320 align:middle line:84%
But I think the advice that
I would give to somebody

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.020 align:middle line:90%
is to use that time.

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Don't imbalance or unbalance
the rest of your life

01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:03.230 align:middle line:90%
during the process.

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:06.590 align:middle line:84%
The people that love you, and
that you love and care about

01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:11.720 align:middle line:84%
are going to be even more
important after a SSP

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.760 align:middle line:90%
veteran starts remembering.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So the advice I would
give is continue on

01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.870 align:middle line:90%
with your daily activities.

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:25.182 align:middle line:84%
Don't become unbalanced
in trying to find answers.

01:31:25.182 --> 01:31:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks again, Jason.

01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:29.420 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Do you know if Richard
Feynman was in on the cover

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:34.030 align:middle line:90%
up of the Challenger?

01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:37.430 align:middle line:84%
You described a different
reason for the explosion.

01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not familiar
with Richard Feynman.

01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>> He helmed the investigation
that found it was a cold day

01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and the rubber gasket didn't
expand enough to stop the gas

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.240 align:middle line:90%
from leaking out and exploding.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:53.590 align:middle line:84%
What I can tell you
is that I worked

01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:58.750 align:middle line:84%
at Kennedy Space Center for
a period of about two years.

01:31:58.750 --> 01:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the time that
I was working there,

01:32:00.910 --> 01:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
there were still a lot of
engineers and senior executives

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:10.420 align:middle line:84%
that had been there in 1986
when the shuttle was lost.

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you that the
opinion of the engineers

01:32:14.170 --> 01:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
was that it shouldn't
have happened.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.590 align:middle line:84%
In talking to them,
the information

01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that I had gleaned from
conversations with these rocket

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
scientists was that that
shouldn't have happened.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:29.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Last question.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know which individuals
the Antarctic Germans had

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
in the executive branch,
I think you said,

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:40.150 align:middle line:90%
of US government in '59?

01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:41.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:32:41.386 --> 01:32:44.560 align:middle line:90%


01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:48.920 align:middle line:84%
No, and even if I
did know, I don't

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.840 align:middle line:84%
want members of
my family to start

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.060 align:middle line:90%
disappearing by naming names.

01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of
which, last question,

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.220 align:middle line:90%
why haven't they silenced you?

01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say
that my coming forward,

01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:07.265 align:middle line:90%
I had kept it as quiet and--

01:33:07.265 --> 01:33:10.936 align:middle line:90%


01:33:10.936 --> 01:33:13.360 align:middle line:90%
I kept it as quiet as possible.

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I came forward,
it came out in a big way,

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
as big as I could arrange,
or as big as I could manage.

01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:23.890 align:middle line:90%
Why haven't they?

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm still out
talking to people.

01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I suddenly
turned up hanging

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.790 align:middle line:84%
from a red scarf on
a doorknob, people

01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:35.580 align:middle line:90%
would probably notice that.

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:40.860 align:middle line:84%
So am I being
accredited or sanctioned

01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to come out with
this information?

01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:43.680 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.930 align:middle line:84%
No, but I feel a need to help as
much as I can in the disclosure

01:33:48.930 --> 01:33:53.100 align:middle line:84%
process by telling the
information that I have

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.270 align:middle line:90%
and my experiences.

01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And there are
thousands of people

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that come back from
these SSP programs

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and may not
understand why they've

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.880 align:middle line:84%
got PTSD, or depression,
or any number

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of other psychological problems.

01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And they find help at
the bottom of a bottle

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:19.860 align:middle line:84%
or any number of other
non-healthy means.

01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So why haven't
they done anything?

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
world is awakening

01:34:26.190 --> 01:34:28.790 align:middle line:90%
at an exponential rate now.

01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe they want more
information to come out.

01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the times are changing.

01:34:36.610 --> 01:34:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We can always hope.

01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:45.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a quick question I'm
trying to get clear in my mind.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.590 align:middle line:84%
It seems so confusing when you
talk about the whole timeline

01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of things that
were attributed to the Cabal

01:34:55.050 --> 01:34:57.600 align:middle line:84%
just seems like it was just
plain old US government.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:01.410 align:middle line:90%
So where is like the breakdown?

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Who's who?

01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And you know, who's worse?

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:10.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean that the
things allegedly done

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:16.470 align:middle line:84%
by the German contingency
and the US, who

01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:21.140 align:middle line:84%
get the moniker the
Cabal, I can't see who--

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:25.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't see the difference
in sort of behavior.

01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:27.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So who's who?

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And was there ever
any division that

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.270 align:middle line:84%
was like purely US
government not controlled

01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:34.980 align:middle line:90%
by either faction, I would say.

01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> There was.

01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:36.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> There was.

01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:43.380 align:middle line:84%
I would say that the Cabal's
plans for world domination

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
go back from the
research that I've

01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:54.300 align:middle line:84%
found to the American
War of Independence.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And-- OK, one minute--

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.320 align:middle line:90%


01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:01.830 align:middle line:90%
how do we know who's who?

01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this screen gives you
an idea of who is involved.

01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:09.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are
10 companies that

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:13.900 align:middle line:84%
own the majority, lion's
share of media on the planet.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:21.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I think your
own discernment.

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I think as more
truth comes out, I

01:36:23.610 --> 01:36:30.080 align:middle line:84%
think once we deliver
a transition plan,

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.550 align:middle line:84%
then we have something to
say this is what we want.

01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:35.410 align:middle line:84%
Look, you can lie
to us as much as you

01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:39.170 align:middle line:84%
want about not having this
technology, we know different.

01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:44.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
question is a valid one.

01:36:44.290 --> 01:36:48.220 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know the
answer, because they've

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:53.074 align:middle line:84%
got people embedded everywhere,
Mars, Germans, and the Cabal.

01:36:53.074 --> 01:36:55.324 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't even know
they're working for them.

01:36:55.324 --> 01:37:00.170 align:middle line:90%


01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
>> My question is
regarding the mind wipe.

01:37:02.810 --> 01:37:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Does that work for dreams?

01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Like say, for instance, I'm
dreaming of some of the planets

01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:09.440 align:middle line:90%
that you were talking about.

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Does that-- I mean, how
does the mind wipe work?

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The mind wipe, it's kind of
a misnomer, the terminology.

01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:22.580 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a mind
memory isolation.

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.980 align:middle line:90%
They lock it away.

01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Global consciousness
means that you

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
can tap into the Akashic records
to gain access to information.

01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Or it's your own experiences
that you're recalling

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:41.600 align:middle line:90%
that have been locked away.

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's part
of the journey, is

01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to determine which
part of that it is

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and putting those pieces
of the puzzle together.

01:37:51.810 --> 01:37:52.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:56.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:58.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Jason.

01:37:58.097 --> 01:38:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you everybody,
I appreciate it.

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.670 align:middle line:10%
Thank you.

01:38:01.670 --> 01:38:08.384 align:middle line:90%
