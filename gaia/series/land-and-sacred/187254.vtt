00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Water creates and
maintains a social bond.

00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.760 align:middle line:84%
This same water is
their playground.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:90%
They share it.

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:84%
They take it with one
hand, they leave it

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
for someone else without
a second thought.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to no one.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to everyone.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Here, water is an
everyday element,

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
but it is what brings
people together.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Water is never
a simple substance.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
It is, at the same time,
familiar and mysterious.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It takes us beyond
mere appearance.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Behind its prosaic
character, there

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.900 align:middle line:90%
is often another dimension.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Images, a symbolism, an
almost universal symbolism.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> This clay tablet dates
from the 7th century BC.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It was found in Mesopotamia
in the archives of the King

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Ashurbanipal.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.720 align:middle line:84%
It recounts the
Epic of Gilgamesh,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:84%
a tale famous throughout the
whole of the ancient orient.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:10%
>> These cuneiform characters
tell the story of a flood

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.800 align:middle line:10%
and of a hero who escaped the
fury of the waters by building

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:10%
a boat.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
It is the story of Noah
well before the Bible story.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of the flood
is present in nearly all

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of the mythologies of the
world, China, India, Africa,

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Polynesia, in pre
Colombian America.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
It's always more or
less the same story.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Men have offended the
gods, and to punish them

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the gods decide to cover
the Earth with water

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.495 align:middle line:84%
and drown them
beneath the waves.

00:15:41.495 --> 00:15:54.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The drowning of men
to pay for his sins.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.040 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the oldest
metaphors in the world.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:84%
When they imagine
divine punishment,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.450 align:middle line:84%
people often refer to
the flooding of rivers.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Inundation.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
All the delusional
catastrophes etched

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.390 align:middle line:90%
in their collective memory.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Water is the favorite
weapon of angry gods.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.280 align:middle line:84%
This raging torrent is also
endowed with positive virtues.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It washes away the
misdeeds of the world.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
It comes to punish
man, but it also

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
comes to cleanse the earth to
prepare it for a new beginning.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion of a purifying
flood is very prevalent

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%
in Hindu mythology.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.760 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It concerns mainly the Ganges.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.869 align:middle line:84%
This river rises in the
heart of the Himalayas.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:18.515 align:middle line:84%
There, its waters are
of the utmost purity.

00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:84%
So pure, that they
inspired the authors

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
of the real manor, an epic
poet of the 6th century,

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:90%
to write these lines.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:90%
May its water purify us forever.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.310 align:middle line:90%
He, the sacred river.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:90%
The destroyer and enemy of sin.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Downstream, by the
time it reaches Benares,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:84%
also called Varanasi, the Ganges
has lost its original impunity,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
and its foul waters
flow sluggishly.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.861 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it has lost nothing
of its sacred character.

00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%
In fact, the Ganges is feminine.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
She is Ganga, a
celestial divinity

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.145 align:middle line:84%
that the creator is sent down
to Earth against her will.

00:18:20.145 --> 00:18:23.494 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.494 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Her unrest finally found peace
in the hair of the god Shiva.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle line:84%
With his snakes
and his trident, he

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.460 align:middle line:84%
was charged with the
organization of the world.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The Ganges, flowing
over 2,700 kilometers,

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.240 align:middle line:84%
may not be the longest river,
but there is no doubt it is

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:90%
the most holy.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.970 align:middle line:84%
All Hindus dream of
making a pilgrimage here

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to purify themselves
in the waters of Ganga

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
Mata, the divine mother.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Mother Ganges.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:84%
These polluted waters can
bring 1,000 diseases and death,

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and yet, Indians bathe
here quite happily.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The color of the river and
the waste it carries are of no

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.150 align:middle line:90%
importance.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.940 align:middle line:84%
In Hindu tradition, the
waters of the Ganges

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.830 align:middle line:90%
have a purifying power.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:39.185 align:middle line:84%
To bathe in them is to
wash away all one's sins.

00:19:39.185 --> 00:19:48.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Here, they put into practice
the words of the poet.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Whoever washes his
body and purifies

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
his spirit of all the
stains of an impure age

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
will never again fold into
the ocean of the world,

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.660 align:middle line:90%
but will achieve freedom.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.750 align:middle line:90%
All these people have one dream.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Not to be reborn
after their death.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.020 align:middle line:84%
For every life, even a
happy and prosperous one

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
is a burden compared
to Moksha, the nirvan

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Hindu, the state where
the soul blends peaceably

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.670 align:middle line:90%
into the universe.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The best way never
to be reincarnated

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is to die here on the
banks of the great river

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and to have your ashes
cast upon its waters.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
>> But this dream is
not granted to everyone,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
and many of the pilgrims
were returned to their towns

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and homelands at the
end of their pilgrimage.

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Those who can afford
it have had homes

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.195 align:middle line:84%
built on the ghats, the steps
that lead down to the water.

00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:84%
There are sumptuous palaces
here built by the Maharajah's

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:90%
in days gone by.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.490 align:middle line:84%
At the end of their
lives, they came

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
to live here and
wait comfortably

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.275 align:middle line:84%
for the most holy of deaths
on the banks of the Ganges.

00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:53.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
For Hindus, religion
is very closely

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:90%
associated with everyday life.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.440 align:middle line:84%
There is no separation between
the holy and the profane.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.100 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The washing of the soul
and of the body are performed

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:90%
equally and at the same time.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:90%
Water washes.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.615 align:middle line:90%
Water purifies.

00:22:18.615 --> 00:22:21.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Its proven physical
effectiveness--

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.830 align:middle line:84%
when used on both the
body and on clothing--

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
has inspired prophets and
priests of all the religions

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Water washes away stains.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.570 align:middle line:84%
This simple image is
accessible to all.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And water is a very convenient
medium for sacred things.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
It is available,
it's easy to carry.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.615 align:middle line:84%
It's the ideal
substance for rituals.

00:23:00.615 --> 00:23:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It is present in all
devotions, all ceremonies.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Man at prayer establishes
a relationship with his god.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
By definition, the
relationship is unequal.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
He must appear in his best light
out of respect, out of fear.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.885 align:middle line:90%
He must purify himself.

00:23:41.885 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The figurative meaning is
often the basis of the literal

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.620 align:middle line:90%
meaning.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
When incense is burned, it is
associated with the simple idea

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that the swirls of
smoke themselves

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.180 align:middle line:84%
that are carrying
prayers towards the gods.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
In the same way, crystal
water is the absolute symbol

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:20.665 align:middle line:90%
of the ideal of purity.

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:84%
In the second century, the
Carthaginian theologian,

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Tertullian wrote,
in the beginning,

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:90%
god made heaven and earth.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.630 align:middle line:10%
The darkness was still
formless, the earth unshaped.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:10%
The heavens badly human.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Water alone, a perfect substance

These beliefs have been

that they have survived through

a male or a female saint

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.571 align:middle line:90%
Like the story of St. Noyal

00:48:29.571 --> 00:48:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Noyal Is said to have
lived in the 6th century.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.970 align:middle line:84%
She was the daughter of a King
of the Northwest of England,

who wanted to devote
her life to good works.

Noyal had promised
herself to God,

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:51.000 align:middle line:84%
but her father wanted her to
marry, so she decided to flee.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:01.350 align:middle line:10%
With her handmaiden, she
crossed the sea to France,

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:04.800 align:middle line:10%
but evil befell her.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.640 align:middle line:10%
A local tyrant named
Nisan wished at all costs

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.780 align:middle line:10%
to take her as his wife.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.790 align:middle line:90%


00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:84%
As Noyal rejected his
advances and his gifts,

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.200 align:middle line:90%
Nisan had her beheaded.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:90%


00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> As the sword fell onto
her neck, a miracle happened.

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.000 align:middle line:10%
Instead of falling
to the ground,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Noyal took her head and her
hands and went on her way.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.930 align:middle line:90%


00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.020 align:middle line:84%
The story goes that a
little further on, Noyal

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.740 align:middle line:84%
shed three drops of blood,
and on that exact spot,

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.230 align:middle line:84%
three springs rose
out of the ground.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.080 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Christian version,

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.180 align:middle line:84%
this was the origin
of the three fountains

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.150 align:middle line:84%
that were built here at
Noyal-Pontivy in Brittany

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:09.847 align:middle line:90%
around the year 1600.

00:50:09.847 --> 00:50:12.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of holy fountains
are scattered throughout

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:17.160 align:middle line:84%
the regions of France, and
each one is under the auspices

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of a Saint with a
gift of healing.

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.825 align:middle line:90%
And the beliefs persist.

00:50:21.825 --> 00:50:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Even today, communities
are reluctant to use

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.560 align:middle line:84%
these fountains for irrigating
fields or cleaning the streets.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:38.490 align:middle line:90%


00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Man will never have a
simple relationship with water,

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:45.720 align:middle line:84%
because it is a great
part of himself.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Because it is many things.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it is charged with
contradictory symbolism.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:50:56.050 --> 00:51:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because from the very
beginning, water is transformed.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.690 align:middle line:84%
It changes its nature,
it changes its state,

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:05.635 align:middle line:90%
but it never dies.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.860 align:middle line:84%
So we imagine that
its every drop

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.580 align:middle line:84%
contains the memory of the
world and perhaps the secret

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:18.380 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.
