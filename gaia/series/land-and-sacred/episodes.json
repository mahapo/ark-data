Water as the principal element in rituals — in the India of today, just as in ancient Greece or in Voodoo rites; water the purifier in Hinduism and as in the religions of the book, the myth of the flood, the waters of the Ganges, the deification of the Nile, the river and hell, springs and their miraculous properties.","teaser":"This episode proposes a journey into the realm of water, taking us beyond its everyday dimension to evoke its value as a symbol, its uses in ritual, its powers, its gods.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/26adc4f9-ada7-4ff4-9d75-d95d087eb365/188275_LS_e1_Water-and-Its-Powers_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/687bc003-21a8-4ce9-8ebe-359bfcd2ee07/188275_LS_e1_Water-and-Its-Powers_16x9_clean.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/687bc003-21a8-4ce9-8ebe-359bfcd2ee07/188275_LS_e1_Water-and-Its-Powers_16x9_clean.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/687bc003-21a8-4ce9-8ebe-359bfcd2ee07/188275_LS_e1_Water-and-Its-Powers_16x9_clean.jpg"}},{"seriesId":188273,"seriesTitle":"The Land and the Sacred","seriesPath":"series/land-and-sacred","seriesVoteDownCount":2,"seriesVoteUpCount":83,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2020-02-27","episode":2,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/9638a3a3-54aa-4764-9f17-1948536ca8f6/188276_LS_e2_Animals-as-Divinities_hero-clean.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/animals-divinities","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":1,"title":"Animals as Divinities","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":4,"voteUpCount":33,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":3,"seasonCount":1,"preview":{"duration":159,"mediaId":187250,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":187250,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":3124,"mediaId":187252,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":187252,"isFree":false},"id":188276,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"We examine how, sometimes, man has made an animal into a god.
