>> "Thinking Aloud"--
conversations on the leading

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.290 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.090 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:32.033 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Our topic today is
society in transition.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Jean Houston,
one of the world's

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
great penetrating minds,
psychologists, social thinker,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:90%
agent of transformation.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
She is author of
17 books, including

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.970 align:middle line:84%
the "Hero and the Goddess," "The
Passion of Isis and Osiris,"

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
"The Possible Human-- a
passion for the possible,"

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:84%
"In Search of the
Beloved," and "Jump Time."

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
She is also director of the
Foundation for Mind Research

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and is a consultant
with world leaders

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and great thinkers
from all countries.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jean.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you again.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.085 align:middle line:84%
Lovely to be with
you again, Jeffrey.

00:01:17.085 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You used the term jump time
to refer to the present moment,

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that something exhilarating
is taking place now,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
something unique not only in
the history of human society,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps in the history
of evolution itself.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yes, I actually
use this as a term,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.460 align:middle line:84%
but probably originally derives
from certain neo Darwinian

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
theory, Stephen Jay Gould
speaking of punctuated

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.035 align:middle line:84%
It's marvelous, the
sound and the voice.

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Evolutionary leaps.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the fossil record shows
things go along as they are

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:90%
for a period of time.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly in relatively
few generations,

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
in terms of evolution zoom!

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The fossil record
changes quite remarkably.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm taking
that whole notion

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
of punctuated equilibrium.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm applying it to the human
species and the Earth process

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:84%
that suddenly we are in
such a state of whole system

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.550 align:middle line:90%
transition.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, yesterday looks
nothing like tomorrow.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.837 align:middle line:84%
The maps don't
fit the territory,

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
that we really have
to speak about I'm

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:90%
referring to as jump time.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The word, which seems to me
the drama behind the world.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, never has
there been such a level

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of widespread deconstruction
and reconstruction.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this
applies to human nature

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.375 align:middle line:84%
as well, that our very nature
is in the process of transition.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting to me
that with regard to the theory

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
of evolution, the creationists
use this idea of punctuated

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.450 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium to say that there
must be some sort of divine

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.485 align:middle line:90%
intervention taking place here.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course,
what could it be.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a species at
the edge of its tolerance,

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
whether we're bored
with ourselves,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
there's a kind of divine time
release capsule within us.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it belongs to
things that suddenly we

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
are technologically linked.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
We are in a world of
colossal busy bodyness

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
through the internet
and other agencies.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
The world mind is taking
a walk with itself,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.630 align:middle line:84%
that the crisis of
complexity is so great.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.760 align:middle line:84%
As the poet says, thank
God our time is now.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
When wrong comes up to
meet us everywhere, never

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:90%
to leap leave us.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So we take the longest
stride a soul folk ever took.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is that stride of
soul that is calling us forth,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.905 align:middle line:90%
that lure of becoming.

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So whether it is the
push from the past

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
or the lure of the
future, whether it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.608 align:middle line:84%
is the god structure saying,
it's time to wake up now,

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
the hound of heaven
going woof, woof,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:84%
woof get on with it,
whatever it is, factor's

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:90%
unique in human experience.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.567 align:middle line:84%
The rise of women to
full partnership with men

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and the whole domain
of human affairs,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
surely, the biggest
change in human history.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And this joined to other
just grim necessity

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I think is the fact that
we are all attending

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
a wake for a way of being that
has been ours for hundreds,

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.390 align:middle line:90%
if not thousands of years.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Now I am generally
optimistic because I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:90%
see patterns emerging.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And what I try to do in
my new book, "Jump Time,"

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
is to show what some
of these patterns are

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and what we can do to
farm them in our lives

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:90%
and in our communities.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think suggest that people
conserve as conscious agents

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.612 align:middle line:84%
to help mold the changes
that are taking place.

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I believe that.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And I also talk about various
forces that are happening now.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think there is a
kind of pulse from the Earth

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
and from the universe.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once we saw that picture
of the Earth from outer space,

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.890 align:middle line:90%
we were no longer her baby.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:90%
We were her steward.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
We were her partner.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And we are being pulsed I
think by universal forces.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the need to
repattern human nature.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.707 align:middle line:84%
And now that we know so much
about human development,

00:04:48.707 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and it is subject that
you've talked about so much

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.180 align:middle line:84%
on this program, we know what
we can do and what we can be.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.520 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know that before.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.900 align:middle line:90%
The regenesis of society.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Social structures
are breaking down

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:84%
because they come from old
industrial or church written

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:90%
societies.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:84%
Of the new
cosmology's certainly.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that the
breakdown of the membrane

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.590 align:middle line:90%
between peoples.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.660 align:middle line:90%
We're living in a fusion world.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.090 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter in it called
Walk and Roll in the rainbow

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, new styles of food.

00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:22.882 align:middle line:90%
New styles--

00:05:22.882 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Food.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --of music.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Music, literature.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are
becoming polymorphous

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:90%
perverse in our cultures.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:90%
We are hyphenated.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
We are-- it's not just simply
Afro Cuban, chicano punk.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
It's that hybrid sounds
for hybrid souls.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a kind of
cultural mitosis

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
that is going on that
is germinating literally

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.205 align:middle line:90%
whole new social forms.

00:05:46.205 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And the whole sense of
human identity is changing.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes, and human responsibility.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.645 align:middle line:90%
So it's some of these forces.

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, the
breakthrough of the depths.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.100 align:middle line:90%
The zeit is getting geisted.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is rising.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, you have those
wonderful cultural fusions.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that you
can go to any supermarket

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and find the secrets of
spiritual technologies

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.025 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit and
the wisdom teachings

00:06:09.025 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that before people would have to
spend their whole life looking

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.450 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.555 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, nothing like this
has ever happened quite

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:15.750 align:middle line:90%
in the history of humanity.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> No, never, never, not in
the history as we have it, no.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And so there's
some concern, I think,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
as to whether people are capable
of expanding, of stretching,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:84%
of changing as fast as
everything around us is

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.095 align:middle line:84%
changing, and is it
all for the good?

00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:34.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
we have responsibility.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
We know that
progress is not as it

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
has been defined as just
scientific or technological

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:90%
progress.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we will end
up in an apocalypse.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:90%
But progress is also values.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:90%
Progress is human deepening.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I know so because I travel so
much and see so many people.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I just see people waking
up to a sense of urgency.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.860 align:middle line:84%
And this whole sense that
you hear, it's like a mantra

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.370 align:middle line:90%
What can I do to serve?

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.370 align:middle line:84%
What can I be so that
I can serve better?

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:90%
And my experience knows--

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
I know from my own work for
so many years, 35 years,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
that given teaching, given
training, given opportunity

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
most people can realize
a much larger bandwidth

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
of human possibility.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.015 align:middle line:84%
They can learn to think
in images and words.

00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They can think with
their whole bodies.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:90%
They can orchestrate emotions.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They can enter into the vastness
of their inner space, which

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is as large if not larger
than the outer space.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.862 align:middle line:84%
>> At the same time, there
is a backlash it seems.

00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:35.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, always.

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:36.707 align:middle line:90%
>> A reaction against.

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Always a sunset
effect, always.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:84%
You cannot push the membrane
of the possible without having

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:90%
backlash.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean, look what's
happening to women?

00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The incredible backlash to
women I find around those

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's because the
rules and the situations,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
the expectations of thousands
of years are suddenly changing.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
Of course, there's a backlash.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's good.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
And I mean it's not good.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
healthy if it makes

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.475 align:middle line:84%
you ground yourself and find
greater definition of what

00:08:07.475 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
you want to do and
where you want to go

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.502 align:middle line:90%
and what you want to be.

00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I, for example, I have
a situation where one

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
of my dearest friends, someone
I've known and loved for 30

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
years and traveled all
over the world with,

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.970 align:middle line:84%
a woman who was an inspiration
to everybody who knew her

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
for 30 years, has had a, I guess
I'd call it a tragic reversal

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.795 align:middle line:84%
and has become a
rabid anti-semite.

00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:32.145 align:middle line:90%
>> My goodness.

00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.748 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that
this is partly--

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:34.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is that coming from?

00:08:34.956 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, is it part of some sort
of larger process of the group

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.575 align:middle line:84%
psyche of the world
soul in some way.

00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, one of the things
that's happening is factors

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:51.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're unconscious or
becoming conscious and that

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
if one does not achieve a kind
of balance and inner space,

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
then these repressed forces
that you've been sitting on can

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.010 align:middle line:90%
emerge.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But isn't that
the case for us?

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out
of Western culture.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.522 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out of, I think,
maybe the darkest century

00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:09.322 align:middle line:90%
of human kind.

00:09:09.322 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> A holocaust of centuries.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Never were there so many wars,
so many people killed, so much

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:90%
antagonism.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.198 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of it was just
that you never had the numbers.

00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:19.095 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't think
we've digested that yet.

00:09:19.095 --> 00:09:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the history or
the study of simpler societies,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.570 align:middle line:84%
they simply did
not have this level

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.005 align:middle line:90%
of warfare and of antagonism.

00:09:28.005 --> 00:09:29.380 align:middle line:84%
We are dealing
with a complexity,

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
a level of complexity that
has overloaded our circuits.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I agree.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'm saying we
have to cook on more burners,

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.650 align:middle line:90%
that we cannot--

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
one of my chapters
deals with personality.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I am a practitioner of a
very dubious art of making up

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:90%
limericks on the spot.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
If you give me two or three
words and a minute or so,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.110 align:middle line:84%
I can generally come up with
something, sometimes funny.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And not too long ago
somebody challenged me

00:09:58.890 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
from the audience.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.570 align:middle line:84%
They said, OK, Jean,
here's three words.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Duluth, Minnesota,
gender and drunk.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So I went into my
creative reverie.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I came out with this little
metaphysical masterpiece.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
A mean little man
from Duluth was

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:90%
unclean and unkind and uncouth.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.310 align:middle line:84%
He went on a bender and while
drunk changed his gender

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.480 align:middle line:90%
and is now our beloved Dr. Ruth.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Now what is implied here
is the fact that we have--

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:90%
that we are shape shifters.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.387 align:middle line:84%
Since the Renaissance,
the dominant archetype

00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:38.095 align:middle line:84%
in the Western world
has been Prometheus.

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
He snatches fire from
heaven and from the Earth

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.380 align:middle line:90%
and finds the secrets in nature.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's changing now I think
to Proteus, the shapeshifter

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.705 align:middle line:90%
in this figure.

00:10:47.705 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The god who can
turn into any form.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Can turn into anything.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And even as I said,
my little poem,

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.870 align:middle line:84%
even changing one's
sexual identity

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.101 align:middle line:90%
is not out of the question.

00:10:55.101 --> 00:10:56.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Hundreds of
people do it, yes.

00:10:56.476 --> 00:10:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but the thing is
we live in such complexity,

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
that the frail craft of ego,
the little local self is really

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.440 align:middle line:84%
very-- is insufficient to
deal with present complexity.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what we fracture.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:90%
We go neurotic.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Or we go fundamentalist.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we can't stand
the muchness of it.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Better by far that we take
on-- we become protean and take

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.810 align:middle line:84%
on a much larger identity, which
includes being polyphrenic,

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.420 align:middle line:84%
rather than schizophrenic,
where we have realized

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.530 align:middle line:90%
that we have a huge group.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.078 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I
would ask you now--

00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold on just a second, Jean.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
take a short break.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Aloud."

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Jean Houston--

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
one of the world's great
treasures, frankly.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.809 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
society in transition.

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:50.642 align:middle line:84%
You were about to pose
a question I believe.

00:11:50.642 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you if you really

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
look at how many
different selves you have,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.970 align:middle line:90%
different roles, just name some.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.155 align:middle line:90%
Name about 10 or 15.

00:11:59.155 --> 00:12:00.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it wouldn't
be too hard I think.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, go ahead.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm a para psychologist.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clinical psychologist.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm a radio interviewer.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm a business man.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm a husband.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm a reader.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm a runner.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm a yoga practitioner.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm a son.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm a homeowner, a tax payer.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, go a little wilder
in other kinds of things.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a ufo
researcher for example.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm a person who travels to
sacred sites at holy times.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a person who
when I was a kid

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
I used to take
off all my clothes

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.155 align:middle line:84%
and go up on the roof of my
house top and talk to God.

00:12:40.155 --> 00:12:45.285 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and healer and meditator
and possibly cook and mechanic.

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:46.085 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:12:46.085 --> 00:12:48.085 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't call me
Jeff the chef for nothing.

00:12:48.085 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, there we go.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, and we would
probably have 40 or 50.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.202 align:middle line:90%
>> I could go on.

00:12:52.202 --> 00:12:56.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, if I were to say
to you name something,

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
one of the roles that you find
that you're not particularly

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.975 align:middle line:90%
skilled at, just name anyone.

00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:90%
>> A typist.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, don't say typist.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Or writer isn't yours
like it is mine.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Guitarist.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm a terrible guitarist.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Guitarist, OK.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a guitarist, OK.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
But Jeff the Chef, if you were
to bring Jeff the Chef forward,

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.070 align:middle line:84%
and you took on the
guitar with the shades

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.685 align:middle line:84%
and the subtleties
of Jeff the Chef,

00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:84%
you would not have
the usual kind

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of blocking that you would
have as the musician.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, of my
many roles, the one

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:84%
that I'm known for that I have
the worst possibly is writer.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Jean the little local
Jean is a lousy writer.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:37.878 align:middle line:90%
But Jean who is also a cook--

00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:38.678 align:middle line:90%
>> You fooled me.

00:13:38.678 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No, but Jean the cook is not.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Jean, who is high like
you, a high kinesthetic--

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a fencer--

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.600 align:middle line:84%
I don't have
problems as a writer.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I bridge
from one of my crew.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
You see, this is a
polyphrenia, to a weakness.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
the usual blocks

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.760 align:middle line:84%
and the shibboleths and
the encapsulation's that I

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.660 align:middle line:90%
would have.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, so that one of the
things that I talk about

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.520 align:middle line:84%
is how do you develop all these
different persona in such a way

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:90%
that they can come forward?

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Because often they have
a gestalt of experience.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:13.450 align:middle line:84%
They have skills that have
been developed unconsciously

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.340 align:middle line:84%
that your little local self
didn't know anything about.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
So for example, not long
ago, I took up a violin.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not a violinist.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
But I do have a deep
appreciation of music.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.365 align:middle line:84%
And I would take
on a part of myself

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:90%
that could play the violin.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
learn quite rapidly.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
I had a trainer who wanted me
to take lessons in baseball.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I hate baseball.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Football I understand.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Football is ritualistic.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:90%
It's mythic.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.900 align:middle line:84%
11 young heroes
carrying the holy egg

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
through the womb of the
goalpost while the air slots

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:90%
virgins dance on the side.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Football I understand,
not baseball.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So what I did is I discovered
within myself Mickey Mantle,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.675 align:middle line:90%
who was the great champion--

00:14:54.675 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> A New York Yankee, sure.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:90%
>> --of my youth.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so I assumed the
mantle of Mickey Mantle.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
And I learned I'm pretty good.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.000 align:middle line:90%
I don't play baseball much.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.083 align:middle line:90%
But I'm good at grounders.

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:05.950 align:middle line:90%
I throw very well.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
My dogs absurdly happy
because the Frisbee

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:90%
goes much further than it did.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's a sense of assuming
some of the qualities

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.600 align:middle line:84%
of these different persona
that we have within us,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
but directed by what
I call the entelechy.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:84%
The entelechy is
that divine self.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:84%
It is yourself as if
you'd had 1,000 years

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:90%
to do your human homework.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's the essence
self, the diamond self

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.425 align:middle line:90%
in the Sufi religion.

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a Greek term.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Entelechy, yes.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the entelechy of--

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:90%
it's the divine.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a deep purposefulness.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.315 align:middle line:84%
It's the entelechy of a baby
to be a grown up human being.

00:15:38.315 --> 00:15:40.415 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of like our
destiny calling out to us.

00:15:40.415 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> A higher pattern,
more than destiny,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
necessarily fulfill it.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.900 align:middle line:84%
It's the destiny of the
entelechy of an acorn

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to be an oak tree,
of a popcorn kernel

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to be a fully popped entity.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And of you and me to be
only our entelechy knows.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the things
I show is how do you

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:84%
begin to have a sense of
that divine persona who

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:84%
becomes the orchestrator
of these many, many parts

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:90%
And I show ways of doing that.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:90%
And then to let that--

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.730 align:middle line:84%
the probable is
wonderful to emerge,

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the higher pattern,
the deeper sense.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, ever since I
first met you, Jean,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.085 align:middle line:90%
which is nearly 30 years ago--

00:16:16.085 --> 00:16:16.885 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:16.885 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I have loved the way
you evoke that sense of that

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.272 align:middle line:84%
there's something within
calling out to be born.

00:16:25.272 --> 00:16:27.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to do an
entelechy exercise, right?

00:16:27.355 --> 00:16:28.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, all right, sure.

00:16:28.563 --> 00:16:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, so put
your hands up here.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Like this?

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I want you to
imagine this entelechy self

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.390 align:middle line:84%
in front of you, almost
as a palpable present.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:84%
As I said, yourself as
if you'd had 1,000 years

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.460 align:middle line:90%
to do your human homework.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And this entelechy
has a deep sense

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of you, a lovingness,
an understanding

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of your potentials of your
past, of your possibilities,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
of the pathways, and
is looking at you

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and regarding you with
such absolute loving

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.160 align:middle line:90%
sense of wonder.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And do you have a sense
of that entelechy?

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:07.054 --> 00:17:09.829 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to move
slightly, just move slightly.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.553 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, go into
the place of the entelechy.

00:17:12.553 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
OK, it's hard to
do it right here.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:16.160 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get that, OK.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And now you are the entelechy
looking at Jeff Mishlove.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And but you are looking from the
perspective of the entelechy,

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
and that entelechy is
regarding the human self.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And you are that entelechy
with that tremendous knowledge,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
that tremendous sensibility,
that deep kindness looking

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.800 align:middle line:90%
at local Jeff.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.073 align:middle line:90%
And can you do that?

00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now go back to local Jeff
with hands to the entelechy

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
self, that high self, and begin
to even have even a more subtle

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and yet more palpable sense of
being seen, of being empowered,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:00.270 align:middle line:84%
of being called forth,
evoked by the entelechy.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.535 align:middle line:84%
And what you would do is
you would go back and forth.

00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel now?

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.653 align:middle line:90%
>> What a gift this is.

00:18:04.653 --> 00:18:05.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me what you're feeling.

00:18:05.945 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the sense for me is
we talked earlier about all

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
of these many parts of myself,
and that there's some part

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
of me that understands all of
it, that sees the connections,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
that realizes that this isn't
all just chance that I have

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:84%
these various facets, that
they're coming together

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.530 align:middle line:84%
for a reason, that there
is something unifying.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.185 align:middle line:90%
There's a unifying factor.

00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to
verbalize what it is.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.530 align:middle line:84%
But I had a sense of
it flowing, energizing.

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and it energizes.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you would take
that entelechy self

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
and call forth Jeff the Cook.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:84%
You see, at the time
of doing the guitar.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you would bridge between
higher parts of yourself.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's just a
simple exercise.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.860 align:middle line:84%
>> What a gift you bring to
remind people of that enormous

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.125 align:middle line:90%
potency.

00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we remain as
mysteries to ourselves.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And part of my work is to
school you in the mystery

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it
into time and space

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.500 align:middle line:84%
so that we do become
adequate stewards

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:84%
of this evolutionary
jump time in history.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have for decades
now been traveling all over

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the world, calling forth
this innate potential,

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:20.442 align:middle line:90%
this entelechy.

00:19:20.442 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> We are the lives of flies.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.212 align:middle line:90%
We have very short lives.

00:19:23.212 --> 00:19:25.757 align:middle line:84%
So by God we go out there
and we do what we can.

00:19:25.757 --> 00:19:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And I've been work--
yes, I work with people

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
individually and seminar
groups, and of course, even

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.142 align:middle line:90%
with cultures.

00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:33.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's something--

00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> In my group--

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.135 align:middle line:84%
>> --to work with
a whole culture.

00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's not
a whole culture.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You work with individuals
of the culture,

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.902 align:middle line:90%
and then they work with others.

00:19:38.902 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
But what you do, for
example, is that you

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
say if I was working with the
Maoris, you appreciate them.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:90%
And you call forth their genius.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.115 align:middle line:84%
And you say my god, what
you have is so important.

00:19:50.115 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And look at what you're doing
with your beautiful maraes,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
the great houses of the
ritual and ceremonial

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and your congregation.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Look at this
incredible language.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Look at this-- and you empower.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you bring
them to situations

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:90%
where they were not empowered.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to show people
just how extraordinary they

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.020 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.070 align:middle line:90%
You re-appreciate them.

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And then they begin to
deepen their culture.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.447 align:middle line:84%
And I've done this
in about 40 cultures.

00:20:16.447 --> 00:20:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> For so many of
these cultures,

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.650 align:middle line:84%
they have this inferiority
complex in comparison

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to the affluence of the west
when their spiritual gifts may

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.450 align:middle line:90%
be greater than ours.

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and so what I
show them is the affluence

00:20:28.492 --> 00:20:31.400 align:middle line:84%
of their culture compared
to often the inferiority

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of the west.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And you do--

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.750 align:middle line:90%
>> They have another bandwidth.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.225 align:middle line:84%
They just have a
larger bandwidth.

00:20:35.225 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> You do the same
thing with people.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I try.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:90%
I try.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You are a great inspiration
to me in your steadfast

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.120 align:middle line:84%
insistence that there is no
such thing as psychopathology.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I prefer
not to pathologies.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.300 align:middle line:84%
I always try to mythologize
and to look at the larger

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.820 align:middle line:84%
story, the larger picture, the
many, many different patterns

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
of connection that are there
because I look at a person.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
And I see who they are.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:84%
But I also see the great
story that is behind them.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I see you Krishna behind
those aviator glasses.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:90%
I saw you.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I see you, Parsifal.

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Hey, Mary Magdalene.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
How are you doing with
your clients these days?

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And so one does see
the larger story.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And because you see it
and you hold it for them,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.862 align:middle line:84%
then they can begin
to release themselves

00:21:24.862 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:90%
into that larger story.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we tend to get
caught up in the littleness

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:30.287 align:middle line:84%
of our lives and
in the affairs--

00:21:30.287 --> 00:21:31.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Serial monotony.

00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:31.887 align:middle line:90%
>> --of the ego.

00:21:31.887 --> 00:21:33.595 align:middle line:84%
>> One darn thing
after another, yeah.

00:21:33.595 --> 00:21:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>> You're looking at everybody
from the mythic perspective.

00:21:36.635 --> 00:21:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, mythic or a larger
pattern of connection.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.980 align:middle line:84%
When you've had as
much experience,

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not putting
myself on a pedestal here.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.020 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't really true.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I've had a lot of experience.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And from that experience,
I try to bring

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.390 align:middle line:84%
that to seeing a
person and placing them

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.710 align:middle line:90%
in the larger story.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
But anybody can
do it for anybody.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.520 align:middle line:90%
But the greatest gift that--

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.680 align:middle line:84%
the greatest potential
there is for one person

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to look at another and
say, I see you hole.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you may be involved
in what we might

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:90%
refer to as unskilled behavior.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's just so
much more to you.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And I hold you in
that greatness.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.568 align:middle line:84%
In northern India,
they have a practice

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:18.110 align:middle line:84%
where one person
will say to another,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm in a time of
depression and dispair.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
Will you be God for
me for three months?

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Help me to hold on
to what I really am.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, Indeed.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
I'll be God for you
for three months.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And so you have--

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and I try to encourage
people to join

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
in teaching learning communities
that are also places where we

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:38.060 align:middle line:84%
hold each other's dream
as well as to grow in

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.410 align:middle line:90%
body, mind, and spirit.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean Houston, what a joy it
has been to share this program

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:84%
with you and to feel renewed and
reawakened and touch with some

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.080 align:middle line:84%
great entelechy
calling me forth.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.855 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:22:52.855 --> 00:22:54.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much, Jeff.

00:22:54.845 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.540 align:middle line:90%
