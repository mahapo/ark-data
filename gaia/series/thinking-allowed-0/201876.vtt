00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.970 align:middle line:10%
Today we're going to be
exploring determinism,

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.580 align:middle line:10%
free will and fate.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And my guest, Arthur
Young, is the inventor

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of the Bell helicopter, also a
philosopher and a cosmologist,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.550 align:middle line:84%
the author of "The
Reflexive Universe"

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and "The Geometry of Meaning."

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Arthur.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Arthur, when you spent
much of your life

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
developing they Bell helicopter,
the first commercially licensed

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
helicopter, you came up with
some interesting concepts

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
about free will, because
as I understand it,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:84%
in the helicopter,
for the first time,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
a human being could move
in any direction in space.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Up, down, right, left,
forward, back, quite freely.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.840 align:middle line:84%
And from the physics
of the helicopter,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you developed a notion
of free will, didn't you?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:90%
>> You could say so, right.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Could we get into that a bit?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, we're talking
really about determinism,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:10%
which is always considered to
be the antithesis of free will.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:10%
>> In the classical
physics, yes.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And still amongst
many people today.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> The freedom which referred
to in the helicopter is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
because the helicopter
is determined.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
If you push the control
and it didn't work

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.380 align:middle line:84%
or if you put on
the brakes in a car

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
and they don't apply
the brakes, then you

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
don't have as much freedom
as you have if the car works.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
A great deal of our time
making the helicopter

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
was what we called,
getting the bugs out.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Getting the uncertainties
out of the mechanism.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
The bug was an uncertainty,
a little will of its own

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.300 align:middle line:90%
that would battle you.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Like gremlins or something.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:90%
Gremlins, right.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
But they were
referred to as bugs.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
But when you get the bugs
out, then the machine

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:90%
is entirely determined.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Determined by what?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:90%
By the operator.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It'll go where
you want it to go.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it won't go
1,000 miles an hour,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
but within its range
of performance,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
you have complete
freedom to control it.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> What you seem
to be saying then,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.280 align:middle line:84%
is that in the macro
world, mechanical objects,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
when they work perfectly,
are perfectly determined,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and that somehow
gives us humans,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
who operate and use
these machines, freedom.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Although it's generally
read the other way.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
For instance, on one occasion I
was being introduced to a class

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to talk
to about philosophy.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced as
a soft determinist.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.290 align:middle line:84%
which is the position
you took when

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.375 align:middle line:90%
we were talking before this.

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.270 align:middle line:84%
The soft determinist
is contrasted

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.430 align:middle line:90%
with a hard determinist.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
A hard determinist
says determinism

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.420 align:middle line:90%
determines everything, period.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
A soft determinist
says, well, there

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
are little leaks and holes and
things where it doesn't quite

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.560 align:middle line:90%
fit, and that's indeterminate.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080 align:middle line:90%
So that's a soft determinist.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>> That would tend to be
very close to my position.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.925 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're saying
that's not really yours.

00:03:31.925 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I say it's not a question of
determinism versus free will,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.320 align:middle line:84%
it's free will on
top of determinism.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And if the determinant isn't
thorough or almost complete,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
then your car isn't going to
work the way you want it to.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Your machine, your
body, whatever.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
If it has its own bugs,
its own free will, then you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.810 align:middle line:90%
don't have as much free will.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the case
of the helicopter,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.830 align:middle line:84%
if we can continue to
stay with this metaphor,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
the pilot who controls the
stick of the helicopter,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.840 align:middle line:84%
can move in any
direction in space,

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.430 align:middle line:90%
is exerting his free will.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, his body
must obey him perfectly

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:90%
for him to do that.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what
learning to fly would be,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:84%
teaching your body
what motions to do.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:84%
I remember one
flying the helicopter

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:84%
without touching the stick,
just by moving my body this way

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.150 align:middle line:90%
and that.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
You could make it
fly in any direction.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that right?

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:90%
Is that an early version?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> No, that was, in fact,
that was fairly late,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:84%
but it was just a
sort of a stunt.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.957 align:middle line:84%
But of course, people like
to have a control stick,

00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:90%
it makes them feel better.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I would think so.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But if the body then obeys the
will of the part of us that

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.935 align:middle line:84%
does will, then the
body you're saying,

00:04:56.935 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:90%
is like a machine, as well.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It's like a helicopter.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:90%
It is mechanical in some sense.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm perfectly willing to take
the position that the body is

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.010 align:middle line:84%
a machine, but it's much more
intricate machine than anything

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.210 align:middle line:90%
we make.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
One single cell of our
body, of which there

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
are many trillions,
one single cell

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
is more complex than the entire
organization of General Motors.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in that complexity,
is there a way in which will

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:90%
emerges from the complexity?

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.610 align:middle line:84%
That it's so complex, that it
can't really be determined?

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Where does free will arise from?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.430 align:middle line:90%
No, it's the other way around.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The reason it's complex, is
because it's grown always

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.470 align:middle line:84%
under the control of the
forces, of the function

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:90%
that it's supposed to have.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.270 align:middle line:84%
If it deviated
from that function

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:84%
at any point in its
evolution, it would collapse.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't survive.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It's taken millions
of years to create

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.660 align:middle line:90%
this device that can survive.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And for instance,
just to digest sugar,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
there are 100 different
chemical reactions

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:84%
per second occurring
in each cell.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is all done
in a very precise way.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain molecules
that provide templates

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
that as it were, create
million times more probability

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
that a certain chemical
reaction will occur.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's made as certain
as it possibly can be.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is left to chance
there, except the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's extraordinarily complex,
and yet exquisitely designed.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In order that you
can play with it.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.785 align:middle line:90%
You do what you want with it.

00:06:57.785 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you're a designer,
you're an inventor.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
You invented one of the most
important and relatively

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
complex machines that we
have around, the helicopter.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I suppose as you look
at the human body,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.750 align:middle line:84%
you begin to wonder yourself
about the inventor of the body.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it's way beyond me.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:10%
But everything they find is
more detail on the intricacy

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.865 align:middle line:10%
and complexity and
precision of the body.

00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But there's another thing
about the helicopter that might

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.050 align:middle line:90%
help with this free will thing.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's led me
to the, you could say,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.615 align:middle line:90%
the mathematical proof thereof.

00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The mathematical
proof of free will.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever
thought of such a thing?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
interesting that you can

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:90%
mathematically demonstrate it.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That would be interesting.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
>> The helicopter rotor is a,
the blades move in a circle

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:90%
swept disk.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.810 align:middle line:90%
So all this represented my hand.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Now if I'm in the helicopter
and I want to go toward you,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I cause a motion,
which will control

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
the rotor to tip that way,
and then it's pulled that way.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Or if I wanted to go
sideways, I'd tip it this way

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
and go that way.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do I tip the rotor?

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:84%
This was this secret I
latched onto early on.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The control has to be 90 degrees
in advance of the direction

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:90%
that you want to dip.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Anticipating it somehow.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Anticipating.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like a gyroscope.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And that control at 90
degrees to the desired force

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.840 align:middle line:84%
can be translated directly
into human language.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
You control a
situation 90 degree

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
by anticipating 90
degrees ahead of it.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's much the way
the judge controls,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:90%
or judges a tennis match.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:03.460 align:middle line:84%
He has to be at right angles
to the play of the opponent.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
If he favors one or the
other, it isn't right.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Can we even get our
meaning of the word,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
right, from that angle?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is an interesting
aspect of your philosophy,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.560 align:middle line:84%
where you'll take linguistics
and somehow combine it with

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.822 align:middle line:90%
>> And with mechanistics.

00:09:20.822 --> 00:09:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that point, my
mind usually goes, huh.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but that's how our
language came that way,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
by modeling itself
after reality.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And there isn't any way
to explain what just is.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look it up
in the dictionary,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.230 align:middle line:84%
it'll say just decision
is a right decision,

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and you look up right decision,
it says it's a just decision.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:90%
You're going around in a circle.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So the reference there
ultimately has to be an angle.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.930 align:middle line:84%
The difference between an
angle and an obtuse angle

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.990 align:middle line:90%
is one that's bent over too far.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.140 align:middle line:84%
An acute angle is one
that's not enough.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But the right angle is exactly
at right angles, et cetera.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis of my
geometry of meaning.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Drawing meaning from
the words, right and so on.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But now, are you connecting
this with free will?

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, because I'm saying
free will is at right angles

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:10%
to the situation
it's controlling.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're biased one way or
the other, you can't be free.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in a funny way,
what you're saying reminds me

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.310 align:middle line:84%
of sort of an American folk
cliche that comes so much from

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.322 align:middle line:84%
the evangelists when they
say, get right with God.

00:10:37.322 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, OK.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Well then, that gives
determinism its function.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's a very useful thing.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But it also leaves freedom able
to use the determinism instead

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
of putting them at
loggerheads, as though they

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:90%
were fighting one another.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of by staying
one step ahead of.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.975 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I'd rather say above.

00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:14.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's a higher
that controls what it can

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:90%
comprehend.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It can't control the
higher things beyond it.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.830 align:middle line:90%
That's the way the body works.

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, each function controls,
the hand controls its fingers,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
but the arm controls the
hand and you control the arm.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I remember when I first
attended one of your lectures,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Arthur, oh, well
over 10 years ago,

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
you made an intriguing
statement that really caught

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:90%
my attention.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And you dealt with
quantum physics

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and the notion of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And what you said
is, that free will

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.240 align:middle line:90%
is the flip side of uncertainty.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that still your position?

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were
two basic things

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
I said when I was going to prove
the mathematics of freedom.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
One is, that it's
at a right angle.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you translate
that into mathematics,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
it's the derivative
of acceleration.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The derivative
of acceleration.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to come to your
point about indeterminacy,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
but first I want to
clear that up this.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.960 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone who drives a car
actually is more advanced

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
in their science than
is science itself.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Science is limited
to consideration

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
of the first and second
derivative, velocity

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.990 align:middle line:90%
and acceleration.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It explains the motion
of the planets in terms

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.820 align:middle line:90%
of velocity and acceleration.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
That was what Newton's
contribution was.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.757 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, acceleration
is a derivative in calculus,

00:12:49.757 --> 00:12:50.715 align:middle line:90%
I think, from velocity.

00:12:50.715 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And the rate of change.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And velocity is a
derivative of length, isn't it?

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.120 align:middle line:84%
So the derivative of
velocity itself is--

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Is an acceleration.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you think the
derivative of acceleration is?

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is the one that
you're introducing now.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Would be the derivative
of acceleration would be

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to acceleration what
acceleration is to velocity.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:14.592 align:middle line:90%
>> So it would be a change in.

00:13:14.592 --> 00:13:15.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Change in acceleration.

00:13:15.675 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> In acceleration.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you do
when you drive a car?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.183 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you do that.

00:13:20.183 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:90%
You change the acceleration.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Acceleration.

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:23.490 align:middle line:90%
Put on the brake.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Push the accelerator.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And steering is another
form of changing.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Changing the acceleration.

00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you're
changing the direction.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Now.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And that would.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> That third derivative,
that steering,

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is not mentioned
in the textbooks.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> In the physics textbooks.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And I've tried over and
over again to convince good

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
physicists and engineers, and
they just look blank and don't.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Either they don't agree
with me or if they do

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.790 align:middle line:84%
agree there's a third
derivative, they say,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:90%
why bother with it.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only free will, it has
nothing to do with us, right?

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the
first principle,

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.550 align:middle line:84%
because the third
derivative is control.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not just something
floating around,

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it has a station, a
sanction in mathematics.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Now the next thing is,
what uses that control.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.602 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:14:19.602 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I was going to ask
you about that.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's where the
uncertainty principle comes in.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if I know exactly
what you're going to do,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.390 align:middle line:84%
then you have as far
as I'm concerned,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:90%
you're not dangerous.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Because I'm predictable.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you have freedom and
can do something I don't know,

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
can't predict, then you're
well, you're uncertain to me

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'm afraid of
you, you see, I

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's
going to happen.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.780 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.275 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what I meant by
the freedom is the flipside

00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:00.075 align:middle line:90%
of uncertainty.

00:15:00.075 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:90%
My point of view is--

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What you seem
to be saying is,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
there's a fear
here of free will.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, a fear is one form.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Most people are
afraid of uncertainty.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We might be amazed by it or
excited or there might be other

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:90%
emotions.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.417 align:middle line:84%
I'm just curious why
you mentioned fear.

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I just asked
somebody what lotto was.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's uncertainty.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:90%
But people enjoy that.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> They hope they'll
get the ticket.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so fear is
just one example.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What you're saying
is, we confront free will

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:90%
at an emotional level.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the point is, that the
treatment that the uncertainty

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
is given by physics, because
physics discovered this,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
you see, is to treat
it as something bad.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
They shove it under the
rug and say, oh, well,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.100 align:middle line:84%
it's the third decimal point
or the fourth decimal point.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to bother
with it or something.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean, uncertainty?

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Uncertainty.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:84%
The Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
has been kind of an
embarrassment to physicists.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> One aspect of it.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The aspect, yes.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> But uncertainty even like
the bugs in your helicopter.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Rather kind of.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you don't want the
uncertainty in the helicopter.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:84%
You don't want it in the
things you're going to use.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to have the
uncertainty yourself,

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:90%
which you use as you please.

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So you see, you have to
look at it from two sides.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:84%
My attitude toward
your uncertainty

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:30.890 align:middle line:90%
is that it's threatening.

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I were inside of you,
that would be your freedom.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
>> In other words, let's say me.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I might not know what question
I'm going to ask you next,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
but that gives me the
freedom, it gives me options.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:84%
If I knew exactly every
question I was going to ask you,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I would not be free in effect.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, also, this is
how you tap intuition.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Remember there was a
story about somebody said

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
to the woman, why don't you
think what you're going to say

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.290 align:middle line:90%
before you speak.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, how
do I know what I think

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:90%
unless I've heard myself speak.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Often you can come
out with things

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.715 align:middle line:84%
that surprise yourself if you
let go, let that uncertainty

00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:18.515 align:middle line:90%
reign.

00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me just twist this
around to you and talk about

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the creative process,
the process of invention.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:90%
You did something remarkable.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It changed the planet in a way,
by developing the helicopter.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Where did your free
will or your intuition

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:90%
fit into that, Arthur?

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's difficult to know.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:10%
You see, you're hedged
about with various things.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.390 align:middle line:10%
You want to go to lunch or
you want to stop working

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.550 align:middle line:10%
or you don't want to.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:90%
There are all kinds of things.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you're perfectly
free, you may just

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
be like water, just roll
down the nearest hill.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Path of least resistance.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Path of least resistance.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, to
be open to your intuition

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
requires, which
is a true freedom,

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.090 align:middle line:84%
but it requires that you be
free of your rational mind.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Frederick Marion, who is
a remarkable psychologist

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.992 align:middle line:90%
that I worked with.

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> In other words, a psychic.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Psychic.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And in fact, the most
impressive that I've known.

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And you've known many.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>> He tried to teach people.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of his teaching
was to buy tickets

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.240 align:middle line:84%
for the best show in town and
go to the theater and just

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:44.010 align:middle line:84%
as you enter the door, tear
up the tickets and go home.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Be free from commitment
to something,

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:90%
just because it's rational.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:50.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I find that very impressive.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there was another
one similar to that One

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
of the helicopter pilots made
a study of the no-shows when

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.780 align:middle line:90%
there's an accident.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.390 align:middle line:84%
When a plane has a
crash, they have a list

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:90%
of who were the no-shows.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And there were more no-shows in
the trips that ended fatally.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Than in the regular trips.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Showing that somebody was
obeying their inner knowing.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Their intuition
about avoiding.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:10%
>> So that's, something
will happen, I mean,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:10%
something is going to happen,
and you give yourself a chance

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:10%
to know is to tap
your intuition.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.675 align:middle line:84%
>> And to do that, you sometimes
have to avoid the certain,

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
like a deterministic force
that patterns and events set

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:90%
into motion.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You may have tickets, you
have plans, expectations.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And the ability to exercise your
free will to change those plans

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.440 align:middle line:84%
is somehow related
now to intuition.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And yes, it is
related to intuition,

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:01.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's related to a higher
plan that's larger than

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:90%
your own plan.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And it's, well that's the thing.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds like we're
talking about fate.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can tap into that,
then things like inventing come

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:84%
I've frequently found I
would invent something

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%
before it was any need for it.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, it turned
out that it was right invention

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.102 align:middle line:84%
to lead up to this
other invention.

00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:29.060 align:middle line:84%
It was though I was
fitting something together,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.220 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
>> As if you, yourself, were
an instrument of some sort

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:90%
of higher intelligence.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all, to the extent
that things happen on a larger

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
scale, we are part of a
plan larger than ourselves.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And that would be fate.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Arthur, after you
invented the helicopter,

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
which was about 1947, you've
devoted the rest of your life

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
to really plumbing these
mysteries of philosophy

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.380 align:middle line:84%
and man's role in the universe
and our relationship to our own

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and to
higher consciousness.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
What more can you say
about fate in this regard?

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the
first things to say,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to say them
in a certain order,

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:24.240 align:middle line:84%
because people have
ideas about it.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Fate conflicts with free
will is what people think.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's very
similar to the conflict

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
of determinism and free will.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a hierarchy
between them.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
An example I give of
freedom, is at the time

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that I had my
basic design ready,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.560 align:middle line:84%
the helicopter, a stable model
that I could fly out the door

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and back again, I was
looking for a backer.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.610 align:middle line:84%
But I looked for
almost two years.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
There were people
coming to see me,

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
different places,

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:10.562 align:middle line:90%
to the Navy, the Army, various.

00:22:10.562 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I had, oh, a dozen
different visits.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> All kinds of effort and
energy was being expended.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Possible backers.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> On your part.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.330 align:middle line:90%
To no avail for two years.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had perfect
freedom about this.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I was as though,
hammering at the door,

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.475 align:middle line:84%
was perfectly free to
hammer at the door,

00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
but the door didn't open
until fate opened it.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Fate controls what is going
to happen on a larger scale.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't prevent
you from doing things.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think I'm
beginning to understand

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:84%
a remark you made
before the show began,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that there's a sandwich
with determinism.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Free will and fate.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.060 align:middle line:84%
If we're in the
middle with our free

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.040 align:middle line:84%
will and we have
deterministic control

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.040 align:middle line:84%
in a sense over our
bodies, over our machines,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
but we are also under this
larger umbrella of fate.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.220 align:middle line:90%
The environment.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've come to look at that
larger umbrella as beneficial.

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:84%
It is what makes your
petty actions enlarge.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I could predict
now from the fact

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:24.590 align:middle line:84%
that time Arthur Block called
me, the moon was in Pisces.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, at the moment of this
show, the moon is in Pisces,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's just past
Jupiter, which

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.360 align:middle line:84%
means that Jupiter will
come to the moon, which

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
means that this whole thing
will get large expansion.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.306 align:middle line:84%
My estimate would be a
year and a half from now.

00:23:45.306 --> 00:23:47.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you really have
thrown me for a loop here.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.720 align:middle line:84%
What will happen in a
year and a half from now?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And why is this related
to Jupiter and the moon?

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Our efforts will
be on a large scale.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.140 align:middle line:84%
We'll be on big
time or something.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Millions of people.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about Jupiter
coming to the moon.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:90%
The moon is the image.

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The thing that television
is dealing with.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it shines by
reflected light and so on.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter is the
principle of expansion.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:24:13.276 --> 00:24:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And when Jupiter
comes to the image,

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.823 align:middle line:84%
the image gets
larger and larger.

00:24:18.823 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Arthur,
I have to say this.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't entirely follow
you at this point,

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.280 align:middle line:84%
but I think the
significant thing here

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
if I understand
you, is that somehow

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:84%
in the symbolism of these events
and the archetypal forces that

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
are represented by the
moon and by Jupiter,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.740 align:middle line:84%
there is a handle on which you
as an inventor, as a scientist,

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:44.270 align:middle line:84%
feel that we can begin
to understand the larger

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:90%
nature of things.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm being very
naughty, you might say,

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.110 align:middle line:10%
and sort of putting
my thing on the line.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But I'm trying to illustrate
what we're talking about.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:02.343 align:middle line:84%
A larger script, shall we
say, in which we're a part.

00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's valuable
but you're looking at this,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.910 align:middle line:84%
because so many people,
the debunkers, so to speak,

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.170 align:middle line:84%
say that no decent scientist
or person who thinks would ever

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.110 align:middle line:84%
deal with this language,
would ever employ the kind

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:90%
of concepts you're using.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And the very fact that you're
willing to commit yourself

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.320 align:middle line:84%
on television in
this regard, and I

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.920 align:middle line:84%
know your theories amplify
this in great detail in a very

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
precise and also elegant
way, stands in contradiction

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.880 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.963 align:middle line:84%
And it's important for
people to be aware of that.

00:25:31.963 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a question of,
you're trying to listen to what

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%
nature is saying.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you listen,
you learn something.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:90%
And I've listened.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
I haven't listened
to scientists,

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.495 align:middle line:90%
but I've listened to nature.

00:25:49.495 --> 00:25:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Now when I was
making a helicopter,

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I had to make
models and let them

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
fly and find out what
was wrong, irrespective

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.590 align:middle line:90%
of what the theories were.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
I found the theories that
prevailed were not correct.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.830 align:middle line:84%
But nature, you can't
say nature is incorrect,

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
obey the theory.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You have to go by
what nature says.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.990 align:middle line:84%
In the case of astrology,
well, I've just checked it out,

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.320 align:middle line:84%
and it works the way
they said it worked,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ancients said it
worked, not the way the moderns

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:90%
say it works.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, probably very
few people in this country

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.450 align:middle line:84%
in our society might think that
a person of your sophistication

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and intelligence
might think that way.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But you're a testimony to
that in the accomplishments

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.610 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been looking for
intelligent people all my life,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and I find most of them are
quite familiar with astrology.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not the hidden thing
it's supposed to be.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
It's, might not
be the scientists,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:90%
but they're a special breed.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Arthur.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to have to grow
them in the dark like mushrooms.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.640 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Arthur, we're out of time.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
having you on this program,

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.775 align:middle line:84%
and we're certainly
going to have

00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:10.510 align:middle line:84%
to have you on again to go
into these things in even

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:90%
greater depth.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being with us.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeff.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very much
for being with us also.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:29.000 align:middle line:90%
