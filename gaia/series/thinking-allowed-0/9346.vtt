This is part 2 of

of the Upaya Zen Center in Santa

Welcome, Joan.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> In part 1, of our
two-part program,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:90%
you told a fascinating story.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We didn't quite
finish it, and I'd

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:84%
like to share it again with
our viewers, of the encounter

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:84%
between RD Laing, the great
psychiatrist, and founder

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.620 align:middle line:84%
of what some people call
the antipsychiatry movement,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and your Zen teacher.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> The story was--

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:84%
I remember the story because
you asked me about teachers.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.005 align:middle line:90%
Who were my teachers?

00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
Or what were my teachers?

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And so the story
was that Seungsahn,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
who is a Zen teacher--

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:90%
>> A Korean Zen teacher.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was my first teacher,
my first Buddhist teacher.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And he was at the
Ojai Foundation,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and he was giving a lecture.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And in the audience,
sitting beside me,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.970 align:middle line:84%
was psychiatrist RD Laing,
and Ronnie was just snarling,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:90%
as he was wont to do.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And, at a certain
point, in the midst of--

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
middle of Seungsahn's
lecture, he said, excuse me.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And Seungsahn stopped and looked
at him, and Ronnie snarled,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:90%
you're no teacher.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And Seungsahn picked up
his stick, and he said,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.390 align:middle line:90%
does the Sun teach you?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:90%
And Liang said, yes.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Do the stars teach you?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Does the Moon teach you?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Does the grass teach you?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Do the trees teach you?

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Yes, said Liang.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.276 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, if they
teach you, then I teach you.

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:36.132 align:middle line:90%
[JEFFREY LAUGHS]

00:02:36.132 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And the point being that
you yourself have learned from

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.840 align:middle line:84%
the forests, and from the
deserts, and the mountains.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the most
important qualities

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.235 align:middle line:84%
that arises in meditation
is a mind of inquiry.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:58.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.620 align:middle line:84%
In the Zen Peacemaker
Order, Tetsugen Roshi,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Glassman Roshi calls
it not knowing.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Suzuki Roshi called
it beginner's mind.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.960 align:middle line:84%
It's that mind which is
open and interested in--

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:90%
awake to the world.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, from that point of
view, everything is teaching us.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
But from another
point of view, there

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.270 align:middle line:84%
have been particular
individuals who

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.170 align:middle line:84%
have been very important
in my life as teachers.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.062 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
Glassman Roshi has--

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a very profound
relationship with,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and grateful for
his faith in me.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And Thich Nhat Hahn, who
is my second Buddhist

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:84%
teacher, and Seungsahn,
my first Buddhist teacher.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Many other teachers, and
friends, and scholars.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And even my ex-husband, Stan
Grof, I learned so much from.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> But it is true that--

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that the natural world,
so to speak, the wilderness,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.620 align:middle line:84%
continues to be my greatest
friend and the teacher

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:90%
I feel closest to.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a sense in
the spiritual traditions

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.839 align:middle line:84%
of the world that people
sometimes need to push

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:21.269 align:middle line:84%
themselves outside
of their own skin,

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.850 align:middle line:84%
outside of the limitations
they think they have,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
and certainly outside
of the conditionings

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:90%
of their particular culture.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is done through
initiation rituals,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
through fasting, and
solitude, and many things.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370 align:middle line:84%
My sense of your path is that
you've gone around the world

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in every direction,
pushing yourself

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
beyond what certainly an outside
observer might have thought

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.770 align:middle line:90%
were your limits.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a line from the
"Tao Te Ching" that goes,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
going on means going far,
going far means returning.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.360 align:middle line:90%
And I think it is true that--

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I was a war baby, and
in my 20s in the '60s.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And it brought about a
certain quality of mind which

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
was fundamentally initiatic.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to go down and in.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
My emphasis in my
whole life, really,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
has been about exploring
suffering, partly

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.200 align:middle line:84%
because I've experienced
a lot of suffering,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
and partly because
my heart breaks

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of suffering.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
So working with dying
people, or working

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
in the penitentiary system,
on death row and maximum

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
security, which I currently
do, is a way for me

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to continue to deepen, deepen
my experience of compassion.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.106 align:middle line:90%
And I think, without that--

00:05:57.106 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
you were saying I
live on the edge.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, when you're on
the edge, you don't know it.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
But without that impulse to
go down and in, whether it's

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
into the really dark places of
our society, of our culture,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.270 align:middle line:84%
or of a human life,
or of my own life,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
or into a place of
suffering like Tibet,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.800 align:middle line:90%
I think that I would just--

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I would have no
reason, really, to--

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just the idea of a
house, and a car, and a bank

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.140 align:middle line:84%
account, and a good job, and
the country club, it just--

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just--

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:90%
it's not-- it's trivial.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You've gone way beyond
that a long time ago.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but it's interesting,
because my parents valued that.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And, really, without
them valuing that,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have
gone beyond that.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was their
incredible hard work

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
which made it possible
for me to, in a way,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:84%
to jettison everything
that was important to them.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But, in a way, to not
abandon my culture at all.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I feel that-- part of the
work that spiritual people

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:84%
in this country, part of the
work that is opening up to us

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.750 align:middle line:84%
is what's called
engaged spirituality.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
cross-cultural exoticism,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
but it's how can we
put our good hearts

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:90%
into service for the world?

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
How can we help with
education, for example?

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.820 align:middle line:84%
How can we help in terms
of medical services?

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to create
a justice system that's

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:90%
compassionate, not punitive?

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:53.950 align:middle line:84%
How can we create
practices of caregiving

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that leave caregivers
intact, and honor

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:90%
the experience of dying?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have an
extraordinary opportunity

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
with the current abundance in
our country to really refine

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
a gift to society that
has to do with moving

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
into a sort of post-industrial
vision of compassion

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.160 align:middle line:84%
in the world, of
act of compassion.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And my life hasn't
really, Jeffrey,

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
been so much about an
exploration of the exotic,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
but I've used, if you will, the
strange, the alien wilderness

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or culture as a way to kind
of expose my psyche to myself,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:84%
which I couldn't do with
conventional psychological

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.440 align:middle line:90%
strategies in an adequate way.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And, in the process of this,
really seeing this life

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
is really about
helping other beings.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're
wearing Buddhist robes.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And although you've traveled
to many parts of the world

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:84%
and been in many cultures,
the Buddhist spiritual path

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the
one that fits you.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so practical, Jeffrey.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
when I read DT Suzuki and
Alan Watts in the '60s,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:84%
it was a thing that just
completely made it real for me,

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that there was an
absence of obfuscation,

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.830 align:middle line:84%
that it was practical, that
it met in a certain way

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:90%
my needs as a woman.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:84%
That it wasn't involved so
much in the experience of faith

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
that I, who had been
brought up as a Christian,

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
had been pressed into, and I
even went to church school.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And Zen practice, I've studied
with some really extraordinary

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Tibetan teachers.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And I did this
after Zen practice,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of Zen
practice, because I

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
wanted to have more
concrete teachings.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to read the
sutra, the direct teachings

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
of the Buddha, after studying
with Tibetan teachers,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
because I realized that the
core teachings of the Buddha

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
made such extraordinary
sense to me.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.130 align:middle line:90%
They weren't exotic at all.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.410 align:middle line:84%
They just work
cross-culturally, which I think

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
is why Buddhism has moved into
so many different cultures

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%
successfully.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening with
Buddhism in America today is

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, because it's
being, in a very positive way,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
secularized through,
for example,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.760 align:middle line:84%
work like Jon
Kabat-Zinn is doing,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.817 align:middle line:84%
or I'm doing in the
penitentiary system, or--

00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> What is Jon Kabat-Zinn doing?

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Jon Kabat-Zinn
works, in a huge way,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
with stress reduction using
Buddhist meditative strategies

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.220 align:middle line:84%
as a way to help individuals
work with the mind-body

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:90%
conflict.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And working in the
penitentiary, which

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
has been a very inspiring and
challenging experience for me.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Which-- in a way,
our penitentiaries

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
are like downbeat monasteries.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And I work in maximum security,
in a men's maximum security

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
facility in New Mexico,
and on death row, where men

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.300 align:middle line:90%
are locked down 23 hours a day.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
interesting opportunity

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:84%
to work with individuals who
are in fundamental isolation.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Joan, we'll
come back to that--

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.813 align:middle line:90%
>> --after a minute.

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:90%
We're going to take a break.

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.222 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:25.222 --> 00:11:29.596 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:29.596 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.840 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Joan Halifax,
Roshi of the Upaya Zen

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.615 align:middle line:90%
Actually, Abiquiu, I think.

00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's Santa Fe.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:45.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Santa Fe?

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And she is author of
"Being with Dying,"

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
"The Fruitful Darkness,"
and other books.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
cross-cultural approaches

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to spirituality.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking about your
work in the penitentiaries,

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:84%
and much of your
work, a great deal,

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:90%
has been with dying people.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right, Jeffrey.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I started this--
this sort of began

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to open for me when
my grandmother died,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:90%
who was an extraordinary woman.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And she herself had been
involved with dying people.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a long story.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I won't go into the whole thing.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You talked about how
she made the sculptures

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.600 align:middle line:90%
for the cemetery--

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --in Augusta, Georgia.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
>> In Savannah.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Savannah.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Bonaventure Cemetery.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And then working
in a medical school

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.910 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Miami School of Medicine.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And then with Stan in the--

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan Grof, the psychiatrist,
your former husband.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
In the project using LSD as
an adjunct to psychotherapy.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Legally.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Legally, right.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was young when I
was doing this, and it--

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:84%
nothing in my culture
prepared me, really,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.590 align:middle line:90%
for being with dying.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And what has evolved for me,
Jeffrey, through the years,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is very deep contemplative
work using Buddhist meditation,

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
various strategies
from Buddhism,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
which has a profound emphasis
on the encounter with death.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me that, more
than any other spiritual

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
tradition, the Buddhists
have explored the nature

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
of the dying process,
and the moment of death,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:90%
and the afterlife--

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> --in greater detail,
particularly the Tibetan

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Buddhists.

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes, Indeed.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
Tibetan Buddhist traditions

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:84%
around death were
deeply influenced

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.060 align:middle line:84%
by the Bon tradition, the
shamanic traditions of Tibet.

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
strategies, even

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.590 align:middle line:84%
in the early sutras of
the Buddha, which I think

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:84%
are extraordinarily helpful for
caregivers and dying people.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So my work, since I practiced
Zen Buddhism, Tibetan,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and also studied
Theravadan Buddhism,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and was familiar
with the sutras,

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:84%
has been to follow those threads
in the different Buddhist

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.100 align:middle line:84%
schools related to
being with dying,

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and to develop meditational
strategies, a number

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
of meditational
strategies that are

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
effective for caregivers
and dying people.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.523 align:middle line:84%
And we have an extraordinary
training program

00:14:28.523 --> 00:14:29.940 align:middle line:84%
for health care
professionals that

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.990 align:middle line:84%
has been going on for years
that's extremely intensive.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm teaching these strategies.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And, also, we have programs
for dying people as well.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just very
interesting, because it's

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.970 align:middle line:84%
one thing when you're
working with someone

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
who is a so-called
stranger, and you're

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
a compassionate
stranger being present

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
for this person and
his or her family.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's another thing
when it's your own family.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a very interesting
experience for me personally

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
to reconcile the struggle around
my own father's dying and death

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.630 align:middle line:90%
and my Buddhist practice.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And was also true with
my mother's death.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:84%
What I've realized
is that grieving

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
is a very important
phase or experience

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:90%
for us to go through.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Again, it unlocks a kind
of depth inside of one

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:84%
which can't be
tapped until you have

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:90%
experienced a profound loss.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
potentially freer.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The value of grief,
I think, is not

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.410 align:middle line:90%
well understood in our culture.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I recently interviewed
Rachel Naomi Remen,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:84%
a doctor who also
works with dying.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And she made a
statement that she

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
felt nothing will transform
Western culture more than if we

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.530 align:middle line:84%
learn how to listen to people
who are going through the dying

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Jeffrey, I think
that is so, so accurate.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:84%
Listening or bearing
witness, being

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
present for a
person who is dying,

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and not trying to fix it.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Simply being present for
the truth of impermanence

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:84%
requires an extraordinary
amount of strength.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we have it,
and sometimes we don't.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.677 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- as someone else
is dying, we're also dying.

00:16:44.677 --> 00:16:45.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm under the impression,
from your work,

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
that there have been times
when you have sat through--

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.740 align:middle line:84%
with people dying, and
it was a horrible death,

00:16:54.740 --> 00:17:00.350 align:middle line:84%
and you felt like the learning
of that was a very great one.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.005 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's also,
Jeffrey, a very--

00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:90%
on one level--

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:90%
I call it radical optimism.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
There are many situations
that we can do nothing with.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.710 align:middle line:90%
We can't make them better.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.614 align:middle line:84%
When I'm sitting in
the penitentiary,

00:17:17.614 --> 00:17:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I have to have that
sensibility within me,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
or I couldn't go
back again and again.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But on the other side of
it is that, when a person

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.740 align:middle line:90%
is suffering, and even though--

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
maybe their suffering can't be
alleviated, the least I can do

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is pray that they will
benefit in some way

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
from what they're going through.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it doesn't
make any difference

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.680 align:middle line:84%
on the sort of
functional level to them,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:90%
but there is something about--

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
well, one great
Buddhist teacher said,

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
there are-- the two really
great practices of meditation

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.520 align:middle line:84%
are meta, which is
loving kindness,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and maranasati, which
is being with dying.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
being with dying

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
is an experience where, if
loving kindness isn't present,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:90%
then desperation arises.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the existential
philosophers imply that

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the human condition itself is
predicated upon the fact that

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.820 align:middle line:84%
we are all mortal,
we will all die.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And we have, deep in our hearts,
fear, and misgiving, and denial

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.910 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's another
vision too, and that is,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
from the Buddhist point of view,
death is the supreme moment

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
for enlightenment.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And great practitioners
live their whole life

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.280 align:middle line:84%
for the moment of death,
when the body drops off

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and the mind ground
is ultimately free.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:90%
And I feel that this is--

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a
vision that I have

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
seen realized by
westerners, not just stories

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.150 align:middle line:90%
of Zen masters and yogis.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.580 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen some
extraordinary deaths

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:07.430 align:middle line:84%
in the now 30 years of bearing
witness with dying people.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have
underestimated profoundly

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.490 align:middle line:90%
the human spirit.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that a peaceful
and present individual

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:84%
can, in the midst
of great suffering,

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.940 align:middle line:84%
bring about a quality
of wisdom which is

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:90%
inherent to every individual.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And there have
been moments I feel

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that's happened in my
interactions with people,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
and there are moments when
it's definitely not happened.

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:90%
One just does the best one can.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> You practice a form of
meditation which is, in effect,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.790 align:middle line:90%
a preparation for dying.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the meditation
is dying, in fact.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
It's dying to the past, and
It's dying to the future.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's coming into the
present, and letting

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:05.070 align:middle line:84%
the continuum of phenomena just
play on the ground of the mind.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
qualities that I feel

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is so important to develop
in Zen meditation practice

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:90%
is radiant compassion.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
gifts that I received

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:84%
from Tibetan culture, and also
from some of the Indigenous

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
teachers that have
touched my life.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
To bring into this quality
of bare attention, which

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
is the ground of Zen
practice, the experience

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
of radiant compassion, and to
marry the two, if you will.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Radiant compassion.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> How-- can you elaborate
on that a little more?

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.892 align:middle line:90%
It sounds as if there is a--

00:20:49.892 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:84%
something specific, say,
with regard to the radiant.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:57.730 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.190 align:middle line:90%
>> When I say radiant--

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:90%
compassion is non-duality.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
As one great teacher
said, it's a meltdown,

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:13.690 align:middle line:84%
a complete meltdown, where
love and sadness unite.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I feel.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the radiance of love, but
it's also the incredible sorrow

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:84%
that we feel that so
many of all beings,

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:84%
really, in one way or
another, are suffering.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Even His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure his heart is broken
about all the suffering

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:39.898 align:middle line:84%
in his country, even though
he has immense equanimity.

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
>> But, Joan Halifax, my sense
from being with you is that

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.910 align:middle line:84%
part of your radiant
compassion here is being open,

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable to your
own suffering,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and being willing to be right
on the surface with it makes you

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:02.170 align:middle line:84%
compassionate to the suffering
of others around you.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The challenge, Jeffrey,
is not to be taken away

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:90%
by the world.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't always meet the
challenge, I really don't.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is why
I practice daily.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is why I
go on pilgrimage,

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
and it's why I go to my
little hermit's cabin,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and why I turn to
the sutras, and why

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I sit with dying people,
and why I go to prison.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Because I'm not free.

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's an honest
statement, and one, I think,

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
honestly, Joan, that makes
you, in my estimation,

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.940 align:middle line:84%
one of the great American
teachers of spiritual

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for being with me.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.400 align:middle line:84%
It's really been a
heartfelt experience.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
