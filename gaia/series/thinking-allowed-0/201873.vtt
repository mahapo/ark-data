00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>> This is Jeffrey Mishlove,
back again with Michael Talbot.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Michael, now might
be a good opportunity

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to talk in greater
depth about some

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of your own personal
experiences.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that'd be building on
what you had discussed earlier

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.690 align:middle line:84%
regarding your childhood
experiences with poltergeists.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And let's discuss for
you personally how

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the holographic model has helped
you to understand these things.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.950 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, well, it's interesting.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:84%
I was asked recently, when
did you really start writing

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:90%
"The Holographic Universe"?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:10%
And I started writing
it years before I

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:10%
heard of the holographic model,
because the model of reality

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.195 align:middle line:10%
that's in the book that is
implied by the holographic idea

00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:10%
is the model of reality
that I'd arrived at because

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:10%
of my experiences.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a lot of
firsthand encounters

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:90%
with the plasticity of reality.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.710 align:middle line:84%
A recent one is a good example
of just how extraordinary

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
some of these plastic
events have been.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I have a little jade Buddha on
my desk that my mother gave me.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is set in gold,
and she came to visit.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's significant
that this was a time in my life

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a
rather rough period,

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and basically in need of
having some reassurance

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that miracles were
possible in the universe.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.458 align:middle line:84%
And when she saw the jade Buddha
sitting on my desk she said,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:90%
oh, I remember giving you this.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.625 align:middle line:90%
And she picked it up.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And I stood by her
as we watched it.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And as we looked
down at the Buddha,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
there was a little
explosion of red light,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.920 align:middle line:84%
and a sphere of red light
expanded out from the Buddha.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.683 align:middle line:84%
And after it was
gone, a red stone

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
had appeared in
the Buddha's head.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it was
a ruby or a rhinestone.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.842 align:middle line:84%
I've been kind of afraid
to have it tested.

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
I'd respond if it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
had been a miraculous
rhinestone appearance.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.938 align:middle line:84%
But my mother sort
of who's always

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:84%
been kind of like Gladys Kravitz
on "Bewitched" when it comes

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.550 align:middle line:84%
to these things kind of giggled
nervously and said, gee,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember that stone
being in the Buddha's head

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.463 align:middle line:84%
And I said, but, mom,
didn't you just notice

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:06.683 align:middle line:90%
something really amazing?

00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
it looked like there

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.683 align:middle line:84%
was an explosion of red light,
and a sphere of red light

00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:12.580 align:middle line:90%
expanded away from the Buddha.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.613 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, yeah,
that's what I saw.

00:02:14.613 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
that can't be.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.200 align:middle line:90%
That can't be.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And my sister was
visiting and had actually

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:90%
worn the Buddha on a pendant.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And she had told me that
my sister had worn it.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, let's call her
in and see if she remembers

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:84%
it being there, because even,
I've experienced these things,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.810 align:middle line:84%
you still have this sort of
gnawing skepticism, go, gosh,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.610 align:middle line:90%
this can't be.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.238 align:middle line:84%
Can reality really
be this plastic?

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:84%
So I said to my mother,
now, don't tell her

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:90%
that the stone materialized.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>> In front of our eyes.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if she just
notices it on her own.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.488 align:middle line:84%
And my mother, bless her heart,
when my sister comes in, she

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%
goes, OK, OK, I won't tell her.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:84%
But the moment she came
in the door she goes,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Pam, the stone just
appeared out of nowhere

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
in this Buddha's head.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't have a sort of
straight scientific approach

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.850 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.120 align:middle line:90%
But that's just one example.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:90%
There've been many.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.050 align:middle line:90%
I talked about the poltergeist.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:84%
I grew up having all sorts
of precognitive visions

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of the future, which
at a very early age

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.660 align:middle line:84%
taught me that time wasn't
as linear as we thought,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
and things that we
don't even have sort

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
of scientific pigeonholes to
put in, like a UFO encounter,

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and encounters
occasionally with beings

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.805 align:middle line:90%
that appear to be spirits.

00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:21.180 align:middle line:10%
I'm not quite sure
what they are,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.760 align:middle line:10%
but beings that aren't
physical beings,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.720 align:middle line:10%
and things that were just part
of the natural warp and weft

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:10%
of my life, have always been.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.458 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, it really
came as a shock to me

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:84%
to discover that other
people didn't know reality

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.300 align:middle line:90%
was plastic.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the holographic
idea excited me so.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, now, let's talk
about it a little more,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:10%
because I think, conventionally,
people who have these

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:10%
experiences search in our
culture for an explanation.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And explanations are not readily
forthcoming from mainstream

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:90%
institutions.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:10%
Oh, you could buy into
a religious viewpoint

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:10%
and think of angels.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Or you might go to folklore and
talk about the little people.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Or you might draw on theosophy
or occult traditions.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But what added
insights do you get out

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
of viewing these things in
terms of a holographic model

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that you don't get from some
of these other perspectives?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
two implications,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
or two added insights.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
One is that the
science that we all

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
learned in high
school science class

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.835 align:middle line:84%
does not allow us to
understand these things.

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
The holographic idea is
really the first sort

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of scientifically
couched idea that says,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
here's how these things
might be possible.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But there's another,
I kind of think

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.365 align:middle line:84%
an even more
profound implication

00:04:35.365 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:90%
to the holographic idea.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And this gets back
to this notion

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that Bohm says that, if
everything is a continuum

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and infinitely interconnected,
all of our ideas,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
all of the words we use
to describe the world are

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:84%
artificial, sort of just come
out of our own belief systems

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.730 align:middle line:90%
and don't exist out there.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that's had
a deep effect on my thinking,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.560 align:middle line:84%
because it means when I've
had these experiences,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't jump-- as I said,
there appear to be spirits.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.520 align:middle line:84%
I say this because I've had,
for example, a few years back,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
had an encounter with the
spirits of several wolves

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
that appeared that I could
see through their bodies.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.368 align:middle line:84%
I mean, several wolves
appeared in my apartment.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I could see through them.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
They were there for
about 10 minutes.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And this was an experience
that I might easily

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:90%
go, well, these are ghosts.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040 align:middle line:90%
These are power animals.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.090 align:middle line:90%
These are demons.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:90%
But I hold my judgment open.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.188 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
they are, but I know

00:05:24.188 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:90%
that these things are possible.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
not to jump to conclusions,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.560 align:middle line:84%
because we may miss
the larger picture.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people might
think, I'm going crazy.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't anymore.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I never seriously
thought I was going crazy,

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
because I'm very emotionally
healthy, mentally healthy,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and these things have always
been positive in my life,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.130 align:middle line:84%
have always assisted me, and
have always been a good thing,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.060 align:middle line:90%
help me survive.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And those people
who don't know--

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.840 align:middle line:84%
there were many
years when I didn't

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:84%
tell people I had
these experiences,

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and no one thought I was crazy.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And they might have had I
told them the experiences,

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.910 align:middle line:84%
but the rest of my
life has always been

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm a very sort of
ordinary person,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.700 align:middle line:90%
except for those things.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
craziness, if you

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
have an experience of a non
ordinary reality, that's

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.400 align:middle line:90%
not evidence of craziness.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Craziness is if you have some
sort of pathological problem,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.860 align:middle line:84%
something that's destructive
to your health or well-being.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.630 align:middle line:90%
And I've never had that.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think it might
be a bit glossing over,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
from what you've told
me already, Michael,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.280 align:middle line:84%
just to say that-- say your
poltergeist experiences were

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.585 align:middle line:90%
100% positive.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's true.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Because I mean,
again, we're putting

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
our own intellectual
pigeonholes over it.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
There were negative aspects
of the poltergeists.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you mind
telling the whole story?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:37.725 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
the poltergeists

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.475 align:middle line:84%
started when I
was five years old

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and it started raining gravel
down on the roof of my family's

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.253 align:middle line:90%
home at night.

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And at the time we didn't
think this was paranormal.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.143 align:middle line:90%
No one knew what was going on.

00:06:48.143 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Michigan.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a very rural area
in the midst of the woods.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
My father would go out with
a shotgun, because he thought

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
someone must be doing it, and
he could never find any evidence

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.893 align:middle line:90%
that someone was doing it.

00:06:56.893 --> 00:06:58.510 align:middle line:84%
He'd shoot the gun
off into the air.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the morning he'd go
up and sweep several shovel

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.650 align:middle line:90%
fulls of gravel off the roof.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And then things became
very definitely paranormal

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.223 align:middle line:84%
when whatever this manifestation
was went into the house.

00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
One of its favorite things to do
was to throw the vacuum cleaner

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You didn't always see it.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
Most often you didn't.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
My mother, if she were vacuuming
and turned the vacuum cleaner

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.962 align:middle line:84%
off, and left it in
one corner of the room,

00:07:18.962 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and would leave the room,
you'd hear it crash,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.973 align:middle line:90%
and go back into the room.

00:07:21.973 --> 00:07:24.093 align:middle line:84%
It'd be on the opposite
side of the room.

00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally you
would see things.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I saw on one occasion
a glass all of a sudden

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
just came swooping through the
room from no parent source.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:90%
The windows were closed.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:84%
There was no one there
who could have thrown it.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
The poltergeist was
also fond of throwing,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.938 align:middle line:84%
strangely enough,
pieces of drift glass

00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and broken beer bottles
or pop bottles you'd find

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:90%
weren't smooth on the beach.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.352 align:middle line:84%
And once in my New
York apartment,

00:07:45.352 --> 00:07:46.810 align:middle line:84%
because the
poltergeist followed me

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.300 align:middle line:84%
wherever I moved until
I was in my early 20s,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw one of
these things materialize.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I was just sort of daydreaming,
looking up near the ceiling.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
this strange little
brown thing appeared.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at it, it
came zooming down at me,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
hit me in the chest,
dropped to the floor,

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and it was one of
these pieces of glass.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And so these were
extraordinary things,

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
but at the same
time, I and my family

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:90%
became so accustomed to them--

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.750 align:middle line:90%
I have two sisters.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.657 align:middle line:90%
If we'd be playing--

00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
cause another thing the
poltergeist would do

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
was stomp all over.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.300 align:middle line:84%
It'd stomp up the stairs, down
the stairs, through the rooms.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You'd hear bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.917 align:middle line:84%
And if we were playing, it got
so if we heard something stomp

00:08:23.917 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:84%
up the stairs and glanced over
to the stairs and there nothing

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:84%
there, we'd just
go back to playing.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:84%
It was so mundane, a
part of our existence.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And you'd said they did
have negative aspects.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.357 align:middle line:84%
You know, it wasn't
all positive.

00:08:35.357 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
That's true, because one of
the things that I discovered

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.898 align:middle line:84%
and has caused me to believe
that the poltergeist was

00:08:39.898 --> 00:08:42.250 align:middle line:84%
an unconscious psychic
projection of mine

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.382 align:middle line:84%
is that it was always
colored by my moods.

00:08:44.382 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time
I was in a good mood

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.048 align:middle line:90%
and it was mischievous.

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:90%
It would do silly things.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Like one morning I woke up
with dried spaghetti noodles

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.660 align:middle line:84%
all over my chest
and no explanation.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.420 align:middle line:84%
I lived alone, and unless
a burglar broke in, boiled

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.213 align:middle line:84%
some noodles, and
threw them on my chest,

00:08:57.213 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
they came from.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And I have no history of
sleepwalking or anything

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.240 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.670 align:middle line:84%
Another instance, it
took all of my socks,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:84%
draped them over the
plants in my house,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.575 align:middle line:90%
silly things like that.

00:09:07.575 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
But if I were in
a bad mood, if I

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
were going through some sort
of rough time in my life,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:90%
the poltergeist became nasty.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And there were a few
occasions, not many,

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.170 align:middle line:84%
where stigmata like bites
would appear on my hands.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.053 align:middle line:84%
A couple of times needles, or
metal objects that were halfway

00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
between nail and needle
would appear out of nowhere,

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:90%
just zoom into my flesh.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, this only happened twice.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.720 align:middle line:90%
And things like that.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So you could construe
those as negative,

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.730 align:middle line:84%
but on the other hand, I view
them as positive because I

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.000 align:middle line:90%
learned so much from them.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
important to mention this,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.500 align:middle line:84%
because in a lot of the folklore
these kinds of manifestations

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.955 align:middle line:90%
are associated with the demonic.

00:09:42.955 --> 00:09:43.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think by using the
lens of a holographic model,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
you're able to see it
in a different light.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.723 align:middle line:90%
And it's important to note that.

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:52.773 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I've learned from it

00:09:52.773 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
is when these
negative things were

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.368 align:middle line:84%
happening, there were
occasions, even though I'd

00:09:56.368 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
had lengthy experiences with
this poltergeist, that I'd

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.243 align:middle line:84%
start to think, oh,
my gosh, maybe I'm

00:10:00.243 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:90%
being demonically attacked.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
When I believe that it'd
start to manifest even

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.682 align:middle line:84%
more as a demonic
attack, but when

00:10:06.682 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I would sort of come
to my senses and go,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:90%
no, I know that this is--

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I can see the emotional reason
that this is manifesting

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in this way, and go, OK,
I'm going to stop this,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have a
positive frame of mind,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
all the negative
stuff would stop.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I always had control.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
But if I relinquished
that control

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and allowed my beliefs to go
into some interpretation, go,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.410 align:middle line:84%
it's a demon, it's a this, it's
a that, then it would get me.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And there was
another instance when

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.520 align:middle line:84%
I lived in my New
York apartment where

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I was playing piano at night.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.297 align:middle line:90%
I had the lights off.

00:10:37.297 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:90%
I was playing in the dark.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And I live on the ground floor.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And the piano is situated so
that the back of the piano

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
is toward a window.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I was sitting there,
playing away, all of a sudden,

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
there was an intense
burst of light in my face.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.790 align:middle line:84%
It was like a flash bulb
went off right in my face.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
And my first just sort of
visceral reaction to it

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
was, oh, my gosh,
a truck is driving.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:84%
It's come off the road and
is driving through my window.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.790 align:middle line:84%
So I literally threw
myself over the piano,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
thinking that I'm about
to be killed by this truck

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.193 align:middle line:84%
And after I sort of regained
my senses and stood up,

00:11:09.193 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:90%
I looked back at the window.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.370 align:middle line:84%
There was no sign of what
had caused this light.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
that is strange.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And I turned back around.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked
in the room, there

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
was what looked like
a luminous soap bubble

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
about three feet in diameter
hovering in the air.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.488 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds strange,
but it terrified me.

00:11:23.488 --> 00:11:25.780 align:middle line:84%
Because people go what's so
scary about a luminous soap

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
bubble.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:84%
But it was so unexpected
and yet so real.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.442 align:middle line:84%
I immediately started
moving my eyes from side

00:11:30.442 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
to side to see if it was an
after image on my retina.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.710 align:middle line:84%
I started blinking to
see if it would go away.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was as real as the
tables and the chairs.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And there was a distinct sort of
feeling of evil coming from it.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
run out of the room.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I caught
myself, and I thought--

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
because I'm basically just
an extremely curious person

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:90%
by nature.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.197 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, if I
run out of the room,

00:11:49.197 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm always going to
wonder what this thing was

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and what would have
happened had I stayed.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So I really summoned my
courage and I stopped.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:90%
And I addressed it.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, I want you to know you
just scared the daylights out

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.703 align:middle line:84%
of me, but I want to know why
you're here and what you are.

00:12:02.703 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And when I said
this, this bubble,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.130 align:middle line:84%
which is hovering in
the air, backed up.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And somehow I knew that
the fact that it backed up

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
that it had wanted to scare
me and it had backed up.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, this bubble
appearing had been

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:84%
presaged by a number of
very negative poltergeist

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.880 align:middle line:84%
phenomena, a couple of the bites
that occurred at that time--

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what was going on.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.758 align:middle line:84%
The bubble was only there
for maybe a minute or two,

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
but it seemed like an
eternity at the time.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Then the bubble left the room,
hit a door, and sort of burst

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:90%
and sparkles, and was gone.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:90%
But distinctly negative.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I knew it was
a negative presence.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:84%
A couple of days later
a friend called me,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.067 align:middle line:84%
and I had not told her about
the experience or anything.

00:12:43.067 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Michael,
I have a letter

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:90%
that I think you should read.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.237 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out
I had just moved

00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:90%
to New York from Michigan.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.518 align:middle line:84%
I attended Michigan
State University.

00:12:50.518 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
group of people there

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that were really only
acquaintances of mine.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
They weren't that
important in my life,

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
but they were into black
magic, and somehow they

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.330 align:middle line:84%
had fancied, which was
totally their fantasy, not

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.790 align:middle line:84%
mine, that I was
some sort of magician

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and that I was attacking them.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And so they were doing
group meditations

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and casting spells to get me.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Counter magic.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and I had not even
thought of these people.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
But what that taught me
is that I realized that--

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.410 align:middle line:84%
because I still
think I was, in part,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
feeding this phenomena with
my own psychic energy--

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is that I was not
shielding myself.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Cause what happened
when I learned this,

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.930 align:middle line:84%
while it was going on
I was so interested,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I allowed it to happen
because I wanted

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.753 align:middle line:90%
to see where it was going.

00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:33.100 align:middle line:90%
I wondered what the bubble was.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, OK, get
out of my reality.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.860 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I found out
what they were doing, I said,

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:90%
OK, all of this stops now.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And just through an
act of will said,

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:90%
this will not go this direction.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I put
forth that act of will,

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.710 align:middle line:84%
all of these things,
the negativity ceased,

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:84%
and the poltergeist resumed
its harmless aspects.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And what that
taught me is that--

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I'm sometimes asked, do you
think people can cast spells

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.550 align:middle line:84%
or can exert an outward
influence to you?

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
our will is always--

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:90%
it's what our will determines.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But you also have
to be conscious.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to sort
of shield yourself.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.010 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned that I
have developed a strong belief

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.723 align:middle line:84%
that I am protected so
that my unconscious doesn't

00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:84%
believe that I'm not
protected and allow

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:90%
these things to occur.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
you are protected.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:10%
So your sense is that these
various events are taking place

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:10%
at another level of
reality that's related

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:10%
to the holographic model.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that they're
not just hallucinations.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because I've
had equally extraordinary

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
experiences where there've been
other people present and seen

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
the same things.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.190 align:middle line:84%
But what's interesting is,
again, as "The Holographic

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Model" says, there's no
division between our thoughts

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and the world out there,
is that they always

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
have some sort of
psychological correlation

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.673 align:middle line:90%
with what's going on in my life.

00:14:47.673 --> 00:14:49.090 align:middle line:84%
I could look at
them, and I can go

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
the reason this is negative
is because these people were

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.587 align:middle line:90%
casting spells.

00:14:52.587 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And there've been event,
after event, after event.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.378 align:middle line:84%
Or the reason the
poltergeist is negative

00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
is because I'm going through
a bad period emotionally.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So I've discovered that they are
psychological exteriorizations

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:90%
that become real.

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I say that,
because, as I say,

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe
their hallucinations,

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.680 align:middle line:84%
cause other people have
witnessed them with me.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And the only
explanation in my mind

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
is that our thoughts do project
into reality on occasion,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.685 align:middle line:84%
do bleed through from the
subjective to the objective.

00:15:15.685 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I want to explore with
you more carefully the nature

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.370 align:middle line:84%
of the poltergeist entities
themselves and these other

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.060 align:middle line:10%
And I think a good
way to approach

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:10%
that would be to step
back for a minute

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:10%
and talk a little bit
about what is life?

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.993 align:middle line:10%
What constitutes a living being?

00:15:32.993 --> 00:15:35.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, we're getting
into this area of conceptual

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
pigeonholes putting
over on the universe.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's interesting.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
In another book of mine
I address this issue

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.580 align:middle line:84%
at some length,
"Beyond the Quantum."

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think about
it, how can you define life?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Every time anyone has tried
to come up with a definition--

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.920 align:middle line:90%
well, life reproduces itself.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:10%
It uses oxygen. Whatever your
definition is, you can always

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:10%
find something that doesn't
seem to be alive that

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:10%
fulfills those criteria.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:10%
My sixth grade science
class, my teacher

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.970 align:middle line:10%
gave a list of things,
categories or qualities

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:10%
that she said, this
typifies a living thing.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And it occurred to me that fire
fulfilled all those qualities.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And I said, excuse me, does
that mean fire is alive?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.883 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
no, obviously not.

00:16:12.883 --> 00:16:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, how does
this mesh with your definition?

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And this was addressed a few
years back in a book called

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
"Life Beyond Earth"
by a physicist named

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Gerald Feinberg and a biochemist
named Robert Shapiro where

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
they try to come up with
a definition of life.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And in a strange
kind of way, they

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:84%
arrived at a definition
that, in my mind,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
says that everything is alive.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't quite
interpret that way.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
But they said life
is-- the more ordered

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.880 align:middle line:84%
a phenomena is, the more that
you can assume it's alive.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But again, order, how
do we recognize order?

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Order is something that we
recognize with our heads.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And in quantum physics,
like Bohm, for example,

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
says that electrons
appear to be alive.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.370 align:middle line:90%
And he's not alone.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a number
of physicists who

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:84%
think that every portion
of the universe is alive.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think I've come to believe
that every small fragment

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
possesses life, that it

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
is a manifestation of life, of
some kind of consciousness, not

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
a human consciousness, but
some kind of consciousness.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.319 align:middle line:84%
And you can't draw a distinct
border between what is alive

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and what is not.

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.640 align:middle line:10%
>> I might just mention
parenthetically that one

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.460 align:middle line:10%
of the best works I'm aware
of in this regard is Arthur

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:10%
Young's book, "The
Reflexive Universe"

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:10%
in which he discusses the
amazing qualities of a photon

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.989 align:middle line:10%
that seem to exhibit
consciousness.

00:17:27.989 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, particles seem to
make decisions in unique ways.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You can shoot an
electron at a barrier.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:84%
If you throw a
pebble at a window,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:84%
it either hits the
window and bounces off,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.492 align:middle line:84%
or it hits the window
and breaks through.

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
You shoot an electron
at a barrier,

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.158 align:middle line:90%
it can do all kinds of thing.

00:17:43.158 --> 00:17:44.170 align:middle line:90%
It can hit, bounce off.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It can stop just
before the window,

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:84%
dematerialize and materialize
on the other side.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It can stop just
before the window

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.180 align:middle line:90%
and reverse its direction.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot take any electron
and predict what it will do,

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.420 align:middle line:84%
just like you cannot take any
human being and, with absolute

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
certainty, predict
what it will do,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:84%
which there's a sort of
uncertainty principle in life.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's this quantum
indeterminacy that everything

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
possesses, living and what we
formerly called non-living.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So as these
holographic patterns,

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
these interference
patterns, come together,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
they form like standing
waves, in a sense.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And these holographic
standing waves

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:90%
can manifest in different ways.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your experiences
are quite unusual.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I doubt if many viewers will
have the kinds of experiences

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.457 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I think they're
very important for us

00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:84%
all to know about, because
they represent things that

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.910 align:middle line:84%
are kind of on the fringes
of our own experience

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And what you're suggesting
is that there's a kind of--

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't know the right word.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.900 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, you've pointed
out the problems with words,

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:10%
but a quasi, lifelike quality
to these poltergeists,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.240 align:middle line:10%
that it doesn't quite fit
the old occult models.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.040 align:middle line:10%
Like I don't--

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:10%
>> No, no.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:10%
They represent-- Carl Jung
said that are our complexes,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:10%
the sort of belief
systems or agendas

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.168 align:middle line:10%
that manifest in
our consciousness

00:19:03.168 --> 00:19:05.710 align:middle line:10%
are quasi independent, that they
take on a life of their own,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:10%
and yet they're a projection
of our consciousness.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Not a projection,
but a manifestation

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the poltergeist
was like a complex.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
It was like one of these
semi-autonomous things.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't only inside
my psyche any longer.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.690 align:middle line:90%
It manifested.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:90%
It exteriorized.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.492 align:middle line:90%
And I think you look.

00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:23.950 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
phenomena like this

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:84%
that we try to interpret
it as objective.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The UFO phenomena
is a classic example

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.360 align:middle line:84%
where it just doesn't
seem to fit a purely

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.250 align:middle line:90%
objective explanation.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:34.680 align:middle line:84%
There are thousands
and thousands

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:90%
of UFO experiences every year.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Many of them take
a very absurd form.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And it just doesn't
seem possible

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.783 align:middle line:84%
that we could be
visited by thousands

00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and thousands of
extraterrestrials

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.390 align:middle line:84%
behaving so absurdly
all the time.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And yet the evidence
is very substantive

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.720 align:middle line:90%
that there's something going on.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not the first.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
Many people have looked
at this and said,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.712 align:middle line:84%
gosh, there seems to be
a psychological quality

00:19:56.712 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to these things, and yet,
they seem to be real.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And I believe I've coined
the term omnijective,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that the universe
is all omnijective.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It's neither subjective
nor objective,

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that everything
possesses qualities

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
that we associate with both.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.310 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO phenomena, if you
look at it, it can almost,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:84%
I believe, can be
interpreted like a dream,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.238 align:middle line:84%
that they're metaphors and
symbols, that it speaks

00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in the language with
what Eric Fromm called

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the forgotten
language, the language

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche, this symbolic
language of the dreams.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.147 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, all of the
mystical experiences I've had,

00:20:26.147 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking for them
and going, this is an angel,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:84%
this is a ghost, this is
a spirit, I look at them.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:90%
I go, this is real.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
And other people have seen it.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But what is its
psychological meaning?

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:90%
What is it meant to teach me?

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.420 align:middle line:84%
How is it a projection of
my consciousness, my psyche,

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps the psyche of those
who have witnessed it with me.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go into more detail
and more depth about your own

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.850 align:middle line:84%
personal encounter
with this poltergeist,

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.865 align:middle line:84%
how you came to understand
what it really was for you?

00:20:52.865 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I don't
know how I came to understand.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I always just sort of knew
it was a projection of mine.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was a very small
child I didn't, because you

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
don't have the intellectual
savvy of an adult.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But as I grew older it
was just so obvious to me

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
that it was such a
direct reflection

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
of my interior landscape, of
what was going on in my psyche

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
that I automatically
assumed it was.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And it came as a
shock to me when

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I start reading
about poltergeists

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.118 align:middle line:84%
that people didn't just
accept that matter of factly.

00:21:19.118 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it is one of
the standard explanations

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:90%
is that is a projection.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
But there's still people who
say, maybe it's a spirit.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's this.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's that.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I don't have a
specific point in time where I

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.525 align:middle line:84%
went, aha, this is the
event that teaches me.

00:21:31.525 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:84%
I always just kind
of understood it.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.373 align:middle line:84%
>> But you developed some
kind of a relationship with it

00:21:35.373 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:90%
as time went on.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I did develop a
relationship with it.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the one thing
that did help me understand it

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in those terms was an
experiment conducted

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
by the parapsychologist
A.R.G. Owen, where

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
he and a group of
people got together.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And they decided
to hold seances.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
But instead of
conjuring up a ghost,

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:90%
they decided to create a ghost.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So they named him
Phillip, and to make sure

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.750 align:middle line:84%
that they were creating
this ghost what they did

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:84%
is they constructed an
artificial history for Phillip,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
but one that contained
historical inaccuracies.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Like they said he lived
in the Middle Ages,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.173 align:middle line:84%
but the king at the
time that he lived

00:22:10.173 --> 00:22:12.340 align:middle line:84%
was not the king that
actually lived in those times.

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a king that
had died before.

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:14.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a fictional ghost.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.130 align:middle line:90%
>> A fictional ghost.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.338 align:middle line:90%
>> And they held the seance.

00:22:17.338 --> 00:22:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
interesting thing

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.070 align:middle line:84%
in this is that they
approached it first

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.280 align:middle line:84%
by being very mystical
and very solemn,

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and sitting around a table and
holding a seance in that way.

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they read
about research performed

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:84%
by an early investigator that
said the Victorian seances were

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:90%
always very boisterous.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:90%
They drank.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:90%
They laughed.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:90%
They sang.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So they started holding
seances where they laughed,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
and they drank, and they sang.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And boom, Phillip
started to manifest,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
would start to answer
through table wrappings.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.633 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear that Phillip
was a projection of the group,

00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:50.800 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that like
Phillip, for example, enjoyed

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
certain songs.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to
enjoy certain songs

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:90%
that the group enjoyed singing.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.710 align:middle line:84%
However, if one member of the
group wasn't there that night,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Phillip might drop one
of his favorite songs

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.060 align:middle line:90%
and have no knowledge of it.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.977 align:middle line:84%
So it seemed that that
member was contributing

00:23:02.977 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:90%
to that favorite song.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, Phillip
was quasi independent,

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:84%
because he made up
some things on his own

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.597 align:middle line:84%
that no one was consciously
adding to his history.

00:23:11.597 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things they said
is that he had left his wife

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and fallen in love
with a barmaid.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.250 align:middle line:84%
And Phillip, through this table
wrapping communication said,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
oh, by the way, I
never loved her.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.598 align:middle line:84%
I just went away with her,
but I never loved her.

00:23:23.598 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:90%
And he came up with that.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.348 align:middle line:84%
And no member of the
group had fabricated

00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:27.820 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of Phillip.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about it, this
too is a quality of the psyche.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:90%
I learned this once when I was--

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
I used to have a problem
where I would nervously

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.942 align:middle line:90%
pull out the hairs of my beard.

00:23:36.942 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, OK,
I've got to stop this.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And so just through
an act of will

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I went cold turkey
on this habit,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:90%
as one has to do with habits.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting and typing
at my word processor one day,

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden
I realized that I

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:90%
was typing with one hand.

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, why am
I typing with one hand.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
I looked down, and my
other hand was sneaking up

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.320 align:middle line:90%
to pull a beard hair out.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
A part of my psyche was trying
to fool myself and pull this

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:90%
So it became quasi independent.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.420 align:middle line:90%
That habit was part of me.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> But autonomous.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.870 align:middle line:84%
You created it, and
then it developed--

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It develops its own agenda.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me speculate
a little bit,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.160 align:middle line:84%
because throughout this entire
program I've had this urge

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.350 align:middle line:90%
to pull something out of my eye.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.152 align:middle line:84%
And I looked in
the mirror earlier.

00:24:19.152 --> 00:24:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
there are no hairs.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.720 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing tickling me.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.553 align:middle line:90%
I thought there was.

00:24:22.553 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I kept
feeling it, like that

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.560 align:middle line:84%
could be an example of some kind
of a holographic standing wave,

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.050 align:middle line:90%
or a morphogenetic field.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And anyone who's meditated
knows that when you try

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
to quiet your mind you're
assailed by one thought after

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And they seem to assail
you, not you bring them in.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They have their own
independence, their own agenda.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at my interior
landscape, every emotion,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.240 align:middle line:84%
every desire, every
feeling I have I recognize

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
is a part of me, but has
its own inner impetus,

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
is self organized, and
becomes semi-autonomous,

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and swarms in my head.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I've really come to think
of myself not as I, but as we,

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
you know, that
each of us is just

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.240 align:middle line:84%
a plethora of different
consciousnesses, thousands,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:84%
perhaps uncountable
consciousnesses,

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that our psyche is as rich
with these entities, which

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:15.610 align:middle line:90%
are part of us.

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.910 align:middle line:84%
They're not separate
from us, but they also

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:90%
have their own agenda.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.820 align:middle line:84%
But our psyche is
rich with these things

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
as the Amazon rainforest
is rich with lifeforms.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.110 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the interesting points
that you made in an earlier

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.100 align:middle line:10%
discussion is that many
of these phenomenon,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.760 align:middle line:10%
although they're quite real,
and they have an autonomous

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.370 align:middle line:10%
reality, after we ourselves
have created them,

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:10%
but they might not
necessarily be meaningful.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.540 align:middle line:84%
They might be striking, in
a sense, but lead nowhere.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, well I think
synchronicities fall in that

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
category.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.900 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicities are
meaningful coincidences,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
things that seem to
be just coincidence,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
but occasionally are
incredibly meaningful.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're not.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I had a series of
synchronicities

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.958 align:middle line:84%
where one morning I was doing
push ups, and I had the TV on.

00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:90%
There was a game show on.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.060 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't consciously
watching the game show.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
as I'm doing push ups,

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.118 align:middle line:84%
I realized that I answered
one of the questions

00:26:12.118 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:84%
without consciously focusing on
what the game show was about.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who is Buffalo Bill?

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was "Jeopardy,"
and the game show,

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.820 align:middle line:84%
the question had
been William Cody,

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Buffalo Bill's other name.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.002 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think
anything of it.

00:26:24.002 --> 00:26:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And later that day,
a friend called me up

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and he said, if anyone knows
the answer to this question--

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe you do, but John, we're
having an argument here.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And my friend's an actor.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.337 align:middle line:84%
And he said, were John
Barrymore's dying words,

00:26:34.337 --> 00:26:36.420 align:middle line:84%
"Aren't you the illegitimate
son of Buffalo Bill,"

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.940 align:middle line:84%
to a stagehand as
he's collapsed?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:90%
And I thought about it.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, there's
Buffalo Bill again,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:84%
but it didn't really sink in
too much, because it was just

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:90%
the second time it happened.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Later that day
when the mail came

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.110 align:middle line:90%
I got a Smithsonian magazine.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
And I opened it
up, and the article

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I opened it up to was
Buffalo Bill is alive

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and he's coming back.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And so there was boom, boom,
boom, Buffalo Bill three

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:90%
times in a row.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, occasionally I have
synchronicities three times

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
in a row or something
like that that I look at

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.398 align:middle line:84%
and I go, oh, this is what
this is meant to teach me.

00:27:05.398 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But in this particular
instance I thought,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
this is a kind of
little holographic dust

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.717 align:middle line:84%
storm that's
gathered that doesn't

00:27:10.717 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:90%
have cosmic significance.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And I really sort
of frown on people

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.890 align:middle line:84%
that every event in their life
they go, this is meaningful.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got to-- what
is God telling me

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.242 align:middle line:84%
because the chair
fell here or what?

00:27:20.242 --> 00:27:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes they're meaningful.

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they have
profound meaning.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:24.755 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they're
just these little

00:27:24.755 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
self organized
exteriorizations of the psyche

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that are spinning outside of
yourself like a dust storm

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and don't necessarily
have meaning.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess the ability
to make that distinction,

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to be able to discern between
them comes from understanding

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or having a sensitivity
to and appreciation

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
for the holographic
landscape around us.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to understand how
they can manifest, definitely.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And equally,
understanding the language

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.020 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche,
which we don't do.

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We don't even pay much
attention to our dreams.

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we have this enormous
universe inside ourselves

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.780 align:middle line:84%
that's constantly giving
us lessons and messages.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed
this psychiatrist,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Montague Ullman for this book.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.452 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
which I knew,

00:28:10.452 --> 00:28:12.660 align:middle line:84%
but he articulated in a way
that really sort of drove

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:90%
the meaning home for me.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
has lots of patients.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And he said, it doesn't
matter who the patient

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.512 align:middle line:90%
is in their waking state.

00:28:20.512 --> 00:28:22.860 align:middle line:84%
He can have a man
who is a total jerk.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But in his dreams there is a
wisdom that's way beyond him,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
that his dreams are constantly
trying to teach him not

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to be a jerk, or not to be
selfish, or not to be greedy,

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:31.950 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.117 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, this is true.

00:28:33.117 --> 00:28:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Our dreams have this wisdom.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet, most human beings don't
pay enough attention to dreams

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
to even remember them
on a regular basis.

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
They let them exist in
this foggy interior world,

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.750 align:middle line:90%
and they don't access it.

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.785 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the
"Talmud" it's written

00:28:46.785 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:84%
where it says an
uninterpreted dream is

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.810 align:middle line:90%
like a letter left unopened.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to
do that as well.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to push the boundaries
even further now, Michael.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you've had
personally some UFO types

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.890 align:middle line:84%
of experiences, very much
related to the sorts of things

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.920 align:middle line:90%
that Whitley Streiber reports.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if
you wouldn't mind

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.200 align:middle line:84%
narrating for us
what happened to you

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and how you've come to
view these experiences.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I don't mind at all.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And they actually started
in something that doesn't

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.580 align:middle line:90%
seem to be a UFO experience.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:27.207 align:middle line:84%
But when I was three years old
I have a memory in my head,

00:29:27.207 --> 00:29:29.290 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know where it
began or where it ended,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.238 align:middle line:84%
but it's absolutely vivid
to this day of this woman--

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.780 align:middle line:84%
I call her a woman,
but I don't know.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.655 align:middle line:84%
It might just have been
an androgynous being.

00:29:36.655 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a figure with long, white
hair wearing a long, white robe

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.520 align:middle line:84%
taking me out of my bed and
walking me through a woods.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was terrified
because it was dark,

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.750 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know
who this person was.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.790 align:middle line:84%
The only way that I could deal
with it was to sort of tell

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
myself this has got to be my
mother, even though my mother--

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.090 align:middle line:84%
this did not fit the physical
description of my mother.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.710 align:middle line:90%
We got to the shore of a lake.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.295 align:middle line:84%
And this entity said to me,
are you afraid, Michael?

00:29:59.295 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said, yes,
I'm very afraid.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And it said, then hold your hand
palm upward toward the moon.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:06.400 align:middle line:84%
And it said, now, close
your hand very slowly.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that,
I felt a softness

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.223 align:middle line:84%
in my hand, a palpable
softness, like when

00:30:10.223 --> 00:30:12.640 align:middle line:84%
you hold your hand outside a
car window and feel the wind,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:84%
but there was no wind
blowing through my hand.

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And this being said,
do you feel that?

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.410 align:middle line:90%
And I said, yes.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:90%
And she said, then--

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.545 align:middle line:84%
or it said, or he said,
then I want you to remember,

00:30:21.545 --> 00:30:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Michael, whatever
happens in your life,

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.500 align:middle line:84%
don't ever be afraid, because
for you the darkness is soft.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was a very
comforting message.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple of years
later I told my mother about it.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.700 align:middle line:90%
And she didn't quite know what--

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.240 align:middle line:84%
said, no, no being took
you out or whatever.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, when
you're a child you

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:84%
don't process these
things intellectually.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.070 align:middle line:84%
You just accept the world
in a sort of magical way.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.487 align:middle line:84%
>> How old would
you say you were?

00:30:43.487 --> 00:30:45.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I was about
three when this occurred.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And when I was five
my father and a friend

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
saw a UFO come down in
the woods near where

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:90%
my family's house was.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And it was then obscured by
the trees, but out of the trees

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.590 align:middle line:84%
came two figures, first,
a man in a black business

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.762 align:middle line:84%
suit carrying an attache case,
which was completely absurd,

00:31:02.762 --> 00:31:04.470 align:middle line:84%
and at the time we
did not know that this

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is a common motif in UFO
lore, in UFO experiences.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.917 align:middle line:90%
They call them men in black.

00:31:08.917 --> 00:31:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they don't make sense
if they're extraterrestrials,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
unless they're like
extraterrestrial Amway salesman

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but so they were
just completely nonplussed

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.480 align:middle line:90%
by this experience.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Then out of the woods
came this figure

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.370 align:middle line:84%
with long white hair
and a long white robe.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And the man in the
business suit vanished,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.570 align:middle line:84%
walked off into the
thicket and was gone.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.250 align:middle line:84%
But the figure with
the long white hair

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and the long white robe stopped
in a cornfield and stood there.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.610 align:middle line:84%
My father and his friend
became very frightened,

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.000 align:middle line:90%
drove back his--

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.900 align:middle line:84%
my mother, myself, and
my father's friend's wife

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
were camping out
less than a mile

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.770 align:middle line:90%
from where this had occurred.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.520 align:middle line:84%
They came back and
they got us in the car.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And they said, this
amazing thing happened.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:47.868 align:middle line:90%
They told us the story.

00:31:47.868 --> 00:31:48.890 align:middle line:90%
Drove us up.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.105 align:middle line:84%
And when I looked at this
being, I thought, oh, it's her.

00:31:53.105 --> 00:31:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I always called her
the woman in white.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.890 align:middle line:90%
It's the woman in white.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.080 align:middle line:84%
But again, as a child you
don't necessarily even

00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.955 align:middle line:90%
mention these things.

00:31:59.955 --> 00:32:02.320 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, oh, by the way,
that's her to my parents.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
My father wanted to go see
this being, talk to it, and say

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:06.700 align:middle line:90%
what are you?

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.720 align:middle line:90%
Why are you here?

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.220 align:middle line:90%
My mother said, no, no, no.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we watch
it for about 10 minutes,

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and finally drove away, not
knowing quite what to do,

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
since everyone was too
afraid to approach it.

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The next day my father
went back with a neighbor

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.120 align:middle line:84%
who taught astronomy at the
local Grand Rapids Junior

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:90%
College.

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And they looked for
the landing side

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of this thing that
had come out, which

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
looked like a green
ball of light that

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.050 align:middle line:90%
came zooming out of the air.

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:30.733 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't find
the landing site,

00:32:30.733 --> 00:32:32.650 align:middle line:84%
but they did find the
footprints of this being

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.193 align:middle line:84%
in this white robe, and they
looked like little skis.

00:32:35.193 --> 00:32:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They were pointed
and very narrow,

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and they went back
into the woods.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.135 align:middle line:84%
They took photographs
of the footprints

00:32:40.135 --> 00:32:42.970 align:middle line:84%
with my father's hand next
to them for size comparison.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the photographs
have been misplaced,

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:84%
but there are lots of people
who had seen them at the time.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.633 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
after that occurred

00:32:51.633 --> 00:32:53.050 align:middle line:84%
is when the
poltergeist phenomenon

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:90%
manifested in the house.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's become known
now in UFO phenomena

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:84%
that poltergeist hauntings
often follow UFO sightings.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is further evidence
that UFOs aren't just

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:04.660 align:middle line:90%
a purely objective phenomena.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.960 align:middle line:84%
They seem to blow some sort of
psychic doorway open in people,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and strange things
start happening.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And with me I believe it
blew some sort of gasket open

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.130 align:middle line:84%
that allowed this psychokinetic
essence or energy to come out.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And when I look at this
and try to interpret it

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, as I say,
extraterrestrials,

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.680 align:middle line:90%
it just doesn't make sense.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite know
what it is, but I

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.840 align:middle line:84%
believe the universe has
many, many levels of reality.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I think UFOs are non-physical.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.500 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think that
we are not necessarily

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.470 align:middle line:84%
meant to interpret
them at face value.

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you
say non-physical,

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.930 align:middle line:84%
are you implying that they're
not part of this holographic

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:90%
reality either?

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.300 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a different channel
on the holographic television

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:84%
set, a different channel than
our physical universe is on is

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
what I believe.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are
uncountable channels

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.960 align:middle line:84%
on the holographic
TV, and probably

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.130 align:middle line:84%
as many civilizations
and a richness of life

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.750 align:middle line:84%
on those levels as there
is on our own planet,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.960 align:middle line:90%
in our own universe probably.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And that there are
probably consciousnesses

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and civilizations that
are advanced enough

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to bleed through, but maybe
some of these things also,

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:19.110 align:middle line:84%
they may be just at the level
of wildlife on their mentality,

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:90%
but on another level of reality.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.530 align:middle line:84%
They may not be
sophisticated, but they

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:84%
may have the ability
to sort of manifest

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.730 align:middle line:90%
in a form that fools us.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what I think
is going on is that when you

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:84%
encounter something that is
truly of another reality,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.750 align:middle line:84%
you can't-- your perceptions of
trying to pull it out of this

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.170 align:middle line:84%
blur of energy and make it into
a hologram don't quite know how

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:90%
to put it into form.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
the reason there

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.230 align:middle line:84%
are many psychological
motifs in UFO experiences

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:84%
is cause there's
something going on,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.770 align:middle line:84%
but the surface
appearance is a product

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of the person's own psyche.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, a lot
of what's going on in these

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
various holographic
realities are like ink blots.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, they can be
interpreted like dreams

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.537 align:middle line:84%
as well, that they have
psychological symbols in them.

00:35:01.537 --> 00:35:03.120 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
something real there,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.680 align:middle line:84%
cause UFOs can be
tracked on radar.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They leave circles
on the ground.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.920 align:middle line:84%
They leave traces of
physical evidence.

00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.027 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm reminded
there's a story.

00:35:11.027 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if it's apocryphal.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I've never really been
able to track it down.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.692 align:middle line:84%
It's been attributed to
Darwin, Magellan, but something

00:35:16.692 --> 00:35:18.210 align:middle line:90%
to the sense that--

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.130 align:middle line:84%
if you use Magellan,
that when Magellan first

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.390 align:middle line:84%
went ashore in Tierra Del Fuego,
that the natives saw that he

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.390 align:middle line:90%
came ashore in rowboats.

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But he left his ship
anchored out in the harbor.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well,
how did you get here.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said, in that ship.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.690 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't see the ship.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.392 align:middle line:84%
>> And we certainly know that
there's evidence of this.

00:35:33.392 --> 00:35:35.490 align:middle line:84%
There are tribes on the
Gold Coast of Africa

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that can't see photographs
or can't see movies.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And that there's
sometimes that there

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:84%
seems to be our cultural
upbringing imprints in us what

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.550 align:middle line:84%
we can perceive, that
sometimes we literally

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.500 align:middle line:84%
can't perceive something
because we don't have

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.330 align:middle line:84%
the vocabulary, the cultural
and perceptual vocabulary

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:53.130 align:middle line:90%
to see it.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.510 align:middle line:84%
I think UFOs fall into that
category in a very extreme way,

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that they are so alien to
our ordinary perception

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that our brain really pulls
deep psychological baggage out

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:10.360 align:middle line:84%
of our psyches to hammer
them into some form.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And when we look at them
and read them at face value,

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:84%
like that they're
abductions or whatever,

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're looking
at our own unconscious

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.330 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of the phenomena,
and that we have to go deeper,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we have to see beyond our
own psychological baggage

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to truly begin to recognize
and understand what's going on.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it would seem to me
that it's true that we've been

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.780 align:middle line:90%
blinded by our culture.

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:37.170 align:middle line:10%
We're very much
like the people as

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.230 align:middle line:10%
described in Plato's cave
who can only see the shadows

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.350 align:middle line:10%
on the wall and not the light.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.672 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I feel that
something's happening.

00:36:45.672 --> 00:36:47.130 align:middle line:84%
There is a movement
in the culture.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
The very fact that you can
take a rather respectable

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:84%
scientific concept, like the
holographic model of the brain

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and the holographic
model in physics

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and see that it can be,
without a lot of stretching,

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.900 align:middle line:84%
used to incorporate many
of these very things--

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.990 align:middle line:84%
and Pribram, for
one, acknowledges

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.930 align:middle line:84%
that as well, suggests
that, right or wrong,

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.200 align:middle line:84%
the model is helping us to
open our eyes to these things.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so, yeah.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:15.630 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.960 align:middle line:10%
There's sort of a
bit of a movement

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.322 align:middle line:10%
afoot to begin to
look at these things.

00:37:20.322 --> 00:37:22.280 align:middle line:10%
Because it's kind of the
story of the blind man

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:10%
and the elephant
where they go up.

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:25.710 align:middle line:10%
One touches the trunk, one
touches the leg, and it says,

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:26.770 align:middle line:10%
well, this animal's
like a snake.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.030 align:middle line:10%
No, this animal's like a
tree, because they're not

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.380 align:middle line:10%
seeing the whole picture.

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:31.947 align:middle line:10%
And there are
various researchers,

00:37:31.947 --> 00:37:33.530 align:middle line:10%
for example, Ken
Ring, who I mentioned

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.720 align:middle line:10%
earlier, the near-death
experience researcher, who

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.060 align:middle line:10%
said, look, let's look
at UFO experiences,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.892 align:middle line:10%
let's look at
shamanistic experiences,

00:37:39.892 --> 00:37:41.600 align:middle line:10%
and let's look at
near-death experiences,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.010 align:middle line:10%
and look at their similarities.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're all portions
of some proverbial elephant

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.390 align:middle line:90%
that we're missing.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:47.348 align:middle line:90%
And I think he's right.

00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.070 align:middle line:84%
I think that they
are all experiences

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.200 align:middle line:84%
with the other channels
on the holographic TV set.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we interpret
them at face value,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.578 align:middle line:84%
they're extraterrestrials
come here

00:37:55.578 --> 00:37:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to abduct us and perform
genetic research or whatever,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:00.857 align:middle line:84%
we're being like the blind
men and the elephant.

00:38:00.857 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to look
at the larger picture.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, now, have you,
in your adult life,

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.570 align:middle line:84%
had further UFO
experiences, as a follow-up?

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as an adult I had a
period when I was in college

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.110 align:middle line:84%
where I was driving
with a friend.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And we saw a UFO and
got out of our car.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We were going from
East Lansing, Michigan,

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.478 align:middle line:84%
to Saugatuck, which I believe
was something like a two hour

00:38:23.478 --> 00:38:24.278 align:middle line:90%
drive.

00:38:24.278 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm not quite sure.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
But we knew how long the
drive was supposed to take.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.938 align:middle line:84%
We got out of our car
to watch this UFO.

00:38:29.938 --> 00:38:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And we watched it for what we
thought was about five minutes.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And we made no other stops.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And when we arrived at our
destination, all of our friends

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.470 align:middle line:90%
said, where have you been?

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:40.425 align:middle line:90%
You're hours late.

00:38:40.425 --> 00:38:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And this was the first time
that we looked at our watches

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and realized that we had
this proverbial missing time,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.970 align:middle line:90%
that we lost time.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've had people
try to hypnotize me.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, I
have not gone under

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:84%
to be able to access what
occurred in that missing time.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.140 align:middle line:90%
But I believe that something--

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I had some encounter with
this non ordinary reality

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.450 align:middle line:84%
that we're, in this particular
instance, labeling UFO,

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.572 align:middle line:84%
but as I say, is just
the tip of the iceberg

00:39:04.572 --> 00:39:05.405 align:middle line:90%
of something vaster.

00:39:05.405 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, now, you mentioned the
pieces of the puzzle earlier.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And one piece that we
haven't touched on,

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to bring in now
relates to past lives.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You've written a book,
"Your Past Lives,"

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.040 align:middle line:90%
on this very topic.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.600 align:middle line:90%
Do you see it relating?

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I do very much so.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:25.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we human beings know
so little about the universe.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And another personal
experience that I had

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.530 align:middle line:84%
was when I was a
very small child.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I remembered my past
lives, fragments of them.

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I did not know the
word reincarnation.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I was very confused.

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But the memories
and my realization

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:84%
that I had lived
before were so vivid

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't call
my parents mom and dad.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't understand why
these two kindly people were

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.540 align:middle line:84%
saying they were my
parents, because I

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:48.720 align:middle line:90%
knew I'd had other parents.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, where am I?

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered different
periods of history.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And again, I didn't know
what periods they were.

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:57.710 align:middle line:90%
It was a visual memory.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was very
confusing for me.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would always manifest
all these strange habits.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.310 align:middle line:84%
I drank incredibly
strong black tea.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:06.373 align:middle line:84%
Like at the age of six,
I was brewing myself tea

00:40:06.373 --> 00:40:08.540 align:middle line:84%
whenever I could get away
with it without my parents

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:08.905 align:middle line:90%
finding out.

00:40:08.905 --> 00:40:10.130 align:middle line:90%
I sat cross-legged on the floor.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.422 align:middle line:90%
I would never sit on furniture.

00:40:11.422 --> 00:40:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It took years to train
me to sit in chairs.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:15.140 align:middle line:90%
And lots of things--

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.723 align:middle line:84%
I remembered various
ways that I died.

00:40:16.723 --> 00:40:18.182 align:middle line:84%
I would ask my
mother, I would say,

00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:19.474 align:middle line:90%
do you remember when I drowned?

00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:20.274 align:middle line:90%
Why did I drown?

00:40:20.274 --> 00:40:22.050 align:middle line:84%
She didn't know what
I was talking about.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.092 align:middle line:84%
But as I grew older and
learned about the concept

00:40:24.092 --> 00:40:26.180 align:middle line:84%
of reincarnation,
I realized that I

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.265 align:middle line:90%
had all these experiences.

00:40:27.265 --> 00:40:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to
very quickly say I

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.110 align:middle line:84%
don't remember being any
pharaoh, anyone famous,

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.910 align:middle line:90%
anything like that.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:34.400 align:middle line:84%
I think, unfortunately,
there's a lot of nonsense

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.908 align:middle line:90%
associated with reincarnation.

00:40:36.908 --> 00:40:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Such as the idea, why does
everybody think they were

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.000 align:middle line:90%
Cleopatra?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, which I don't think--

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.162 align:middle line:84%
I think if you have
eight people think

00:40:43.162 --> 00:40:45.620 align:middle line:84%
they're Cleopatra you don't
have evidence of reincarnation,

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.990 align:middle line:84%
but of something a
bit more frivolous.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But the research doesn't show
that everybody thinks they were

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
somebody famous,
quite the contrary.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.240 align:middle line:90%
Quite the contrary.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a past lives
researcher, a psychologist named

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Helen Wambach
who's deceased now,

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:03.200 align:middle line:84%
but she regressed large
groups of people, hundreds,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and sent them back to
various past lives.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And what she would do is she
would pick a time period,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.720 align:middle line:84%
for example, the 1850s, '60s,
and say, were you alive then?

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.040 align:middle line:90%
And if so, where were you?

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Figuring that if people
were fantasizing, even

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.230 align:middle line:84%
at an unconscious level, that
they would associate that time

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:19.730 align:middle line:84%
period with the
Civil War, and she

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.950 align:middle line:84%
would come up with a lot
of Civil War past lives.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.110 align:middle line:90%
She didn't.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, in all
these literally hundreds,

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds, and hundreds
of examples of past lives,

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.170 align:middle line:84%
she had no one who remembered
being anyone famous.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:84%
She also had things that
seemed to very much mesh

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:90%
with historical reality.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Only 10% of the past lives
that her subjects had lived

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:41.520 align:middle line:84%
were lived as aristocratic
lives or in lives of luxury.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The other 90% were grueling,
as peasants, as laborers,

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.880 align:middle line:84%
you know, eking out,
hunter-gatherers,

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And some very interesting
historical pieces

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of information
came out, like she

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.630 align:middle line:84%
started to discover that
at various time periods

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.760 align:middle line:84%
people described
forks as having--

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.927 align:middle line:84%
like at one point people
said forks had two prongs.

00:42:00.927 --> 00:42:01.760 align:middle line:90%
Then they had three.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:02.930 align:middle line:90%
Then they had four.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
obscure historical fact,

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:84%
but that is the
progression of the fork.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So there are things like that.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:12.150 align:middle line:90%
But as I say, no famous people.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And it did seem to reflect
historical reality, not

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.820 align:middle line:90%
fantasy.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Because who would fantasize
being a peasant or a laborer?

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now, we've
talked about past lives.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.810 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about poltergeists.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.340 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about UFOs.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.040 align:middle line:10%
And we've talked about the
holographic model in science.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.000 align:middle line:10%
How do you integrate these?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think they're all
part of the same reality,

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that we live in a
spiritual universe,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:39.770 align:middle line:84%
that I very much believe
that our soul lives many,

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.740 align:middle line:84%
many lives, and goes
through these things.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think at this point in our
development that we've been--

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.560 align:middle line:84%
that we have manifested
in the physical

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.380 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
a consciousness that's

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.860 align:middle line:84%
developed enough to deal with
reality with its full grandeur

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.170 align:middle line:84%
and plasticity, that
for us it would be very

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.570 align:middle line:84%
frightening if there
weren't solid rules,

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.670 align:middle line:84%
if everything started
to slip and slide.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think as your
soul goes along,

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
it starts to learn to deal
with more than this reality,

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.560 align:middle line:84%
with other levels on the
holographic television set.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to
open those doorways,

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:84%
that's when reality, the
plasticity of reality

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:14.257 align:middle line:90%
starts to seep in.

00:43:14.257 --> 00:43:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But then you go through a sort
of shamanistic rite of passage,

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.140 align:middle line:84%
because you've got to go
through-- most people put

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.140 align:middle line:90%
an interpretation on it.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:84%
They go, oh, this
is an angel, or this

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.640 align:middle line:90%
is a demon, or a UFO abduction.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that, you're
missing the basic lesson

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
of shamanism, which is that
everything that you experience

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in the non ordinary
reality of the shaman

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.440 align:middle line:84%
has psychological
meaning for you,

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.500 align:middle line:84%
that you are entering a level
of reality that responds so

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.470 align:middle line:84%
directly to your thoughts
that your every thought

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.210 align:middle line:90%
helps what manifests.

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And in that instance, you
can't ask what is there,

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.510 align:middle line:84%
but why have I
created what is there?

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
lesson that our souls are

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.710 align:middle line:90%
learning as we evolve.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, one might
say that these various so-called

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.240 align:middle line:84%
paranormal experiences are what
my friend and mentor Arthur

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Young would call, oh,
wow kinds of experiences.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:90%
They serve another purpose.

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's not an obvious
purpose necessarily,

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.720 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps ultimately
it's to push us somehow

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.580 align:middle line:84%
into a higher state
of consciousness,

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:18.035 align:middle line:84%
to force us to try and
understand the deeper meaning.

00:44:18.035 --> 00:44:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with that.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're a
natural manifestation

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:24.610 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution
of consciousness.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:28.480 align:middle line:84%
As your soul evolves,
you start to open up

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the plastic levels of
reality, and these things

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:90%
start to enter.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:90%
And that in itself teaches you.

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:36.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, it may not necessarily
be that the universe is saying,

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.110 align:middle line:84%
here, I'm giving you
this to teach you.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.050 align:middle line:84%
But you are manifesting what you
have to learn about yourself,

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.767 align:middle line:84%
just as we manifest
moods and beliefs that we

00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:46.100 align:middle line:84%
have to learn about if we're
to deal with them properly.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.280 align:middle line:84%
These are things that
manifest in a very

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.460 align:middle line:84%
profound and paranormal
way, but are still

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Rorschach's, as you
said, are inkblots of who

00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and what we are as souls.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:45:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you speak in your book,
"The Holographic Universe,"

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.390 align:middle line:84%
of higher states
of consciousness,

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.555 align:middle line:84%
or sort of the evolutionary
force of all of this.

00:45:05.555 --> 00:45:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if we
can go into that now.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I said, I
think that we are evolving

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.480 align:middle line:90%
as consciousnesses, as souls.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
eventually we can move on

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.522 align:middle line:84%
to other levels of reality,
non-physical levels,

00:45:18.522 --> 00:45:20.230 align:middle line:84%
or other channels,
what I've been calling

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.190 align:middle line:84%
other channels on the cosmic
TV set, the holographic TV set.

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think that to
deal with those channels

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.430 align:middle line:90%
that we are really just infants.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The human race,
you know, we tend

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:84%
to think of ourselves
as very advanced.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.500 align:middle line:90%
But we're really like--

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.080 align:middle line:84%
one of the metaphors
that I use is

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.885 align:middle line:84%
we're like babies sitting at the
control panel of a jumbo jet.

00:45:40.885 --> 00:45:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Again, our soul is infinite
and has infinite capability,

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.700 align:middle line:84%
but for us to learn how
to access those things,

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:84%
we are, at the moment,
babies at the control panel

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.550 align:middle line:84%
just flipping switches,
and occasionally causing

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.342 align:middle line:84%
profound things to
trip into our reality,

00:45:56.342 --> 00:45:58.300 align:middle line:84%
but not quite understanding
them, and certainly

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:00.670 align:middle line:84%
not controlling them, not
seeing that the evidence,

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:03.100 align:middle line:84%
that the real evidence, for
example, of a synchronicity

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is that our psyche does has
have reverberations in the world

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.690 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, how
do we begin to really look

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.823 align:middle line:84%
at how to manifest things,
not just simple coincidences,

00:46:15.823 --> 00:46:18.490 align:middle line:84%
but positive things in our life,
and control our thoughts enough

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that we don't manifest bugaboos,
demons, and things like that.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.868 align:middle line:84%
Because we are like the
sorcerer's apprentice.

00:46:23.868 --> 00:46:25.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to
deal with this ability.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
opens up slowly,

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.930 align:middle line:84%
because before you
can deal with it

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.160 align:middle line:84%
you don't want those
gateways blown open.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And it would seem I think
that many of the great mystics

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual teachers have
offered roadmaps or guidelines

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:44.380 align:middle line:84%
for entering into these
higher states that allow them

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.770 align:middle line:84%
to integrate all of these
phenomenon without getting

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.680 align:middle line:84%
swept away or getting
romantic about them,

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.675 align:middle line:84%
but to see them in a kind
of a larger perspective.

00:46:53.675 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I think you're right.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting to me
that the one common thread that

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.023 align:middle line:84%
goes through all
these roadmaps is

00:47:01.023 --> 00:47:02.440 align:middle line:84%
that these other
levels of reality

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.050 align:middle line:84%
are reached through the inner
universe, through the head.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.850 align:middle line:84%
By going into that
inner universe

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that that's where the vastness
of the true universe exists.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.760 align:middle line:84%
And in our culture we think
that what's inside our head

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.488 align:middle line:84%
is less real than
what's out there.

00:47:14.488 --> 00:47:16.030 align:middle line:84%
I believe that what's
inside our head

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.730 align:middle line:84%
is more real than the
consensus reality.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.680 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't
accessed the level

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that shows us how profound and
magical that interior reality

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:24.860 align:middle line:90%
is, most of us.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.660 align:middle line:90%
Mystics have.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and there's even
a sense, if we push it,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that the very notion of
what's inside our head,

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.060 align:middle line:84%
that we would even
think in those terms,

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is a function of maybe that
we're caught in what the Hindus

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:84%
call maya, the illusion that's
created by the holograph.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:84%
We see ourselves as the
holographic projections,

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.820 align:middle line:84%
rather than as the source
of those projections.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, well, in "The
Holographic Universe"

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I say that we're children that
have not yet learned to color

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.610 align:middle line:90%
without coloring books.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.503 align:middle line:90%
We can't just freestyle draw.

00:47:56.503 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
locked in this apparently

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:00.160 align:middle line:90%
solid substantive reality.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Because for most of
us, our consciousness

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.080 align:middle line:84%
is at a point where if we were
thrust into a level of reality

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.263 align:middle line:84%
where we could instantly
manifest as real anything

00:48:07.263 --> 00:48:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that we thought about, we
don't control our thoughts

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and our emotions enough to
manifest only good things.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.950 align:middle line:84%
We'd start to worry about
something and manifest that.

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And so for most of us, to
access those levels of reality

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.280 align:middle line:84%
would be kind of like being
on a very bad LSD trip.

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's why we're growing.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But at a certain point, we won't
need the comforting borders

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and boundaries of maya,
of this physical universe.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.660 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, we'll
learn how to move beyond.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and that sounds like
something of the story that you

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.690 align:middle line:84%
went through, and coming to
terms with the poltergeist

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in all
of my experiences.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.602 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every one of
them has taught me,

00:48:43.602 --> 00:48:46.060 align:middle line:84%
as I say, not only about the
universe, but more importantly

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.080 align:middle line:84%
about myself, and what
I have to deal with.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.470 align:middle line:84%
Cause I think the most
spiritual thing a person can do

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes people
say to me, gosh,

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.680 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had your experiences.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.480 align:middle line:90%
What can I do?

00:48:58.480 --> 00:48:59.280 align:middle line:90%
Can I meditate?

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Can I say a mantra?

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the best
answer is to see a therapist.

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Deal with your own baggage.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what you
have to deal with first.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.170 align:middle line:90%
I learned this.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.540 align:middle line:84%
When I was on book tour,
I did a radio interview,

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.460 align:middle line:84%
a new age radio interview
in San Francisco

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.290 align:middle line:84%
where the man who was
doing the interview

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.548 align:middle line:90%
was a substitute host.

00:49:21.548 --> 00:49:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know that we
had confirmed the interview.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.305 align:middle line:84%
So he was sitting
as the air time

00:49:25.305 --> 00:49:26.680 align:middle line:84%
was approaching
sweating bullets,

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.210 align:middle line:90%
thinking I might not be there.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.420 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived he just bit
my head off, really screamed

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:84%
at me, and said, how
dare you not confirm?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And we had confirmed.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.310 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know that.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.480 align:middle line:90%
And he said, get in here!

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into
the control room.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:39.780 align:middle line:90%
And he sat down.

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And the light went on.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And he leaned toward the mic.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.810 align:middle line:90%
And said, hello.

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And he started in with
his new age thing.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, this
is just very wrong.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:51.850 align:middle line:84%
This is not-- you
cannot be a smiling,

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:84%
spiritual person if you've got
all this undealt with baggage.

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is the most
spiritual thing that we can do

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.320 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to deal
with the here and now.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.960 align:middle line:84%
If you're an insecure person,
you deal with your insecurity.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't try to move objects
with your head, you know,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.620 align:middle line:90%
psychokinetically.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things, because if you

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:09.100 align:middle line:84%
don't deal with
those, you're not

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.370 align:middle line:84%
going to be in a very
pleasant situation

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:15.040 align:middle line:84%
in that outer reality, in
that holographic reality.

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
be pleasant for you

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:20.360 align:middle line:84%
until you have this inner peace
and health in your own psyche.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:25.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now what you're
suggesting here is something

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.950 align:middle line:84%
more profound than just a simple
platitude or a moral truth.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.150 align:middle line:84%
What I think, if I can read
into what you're saying,

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:35.070 align:middle line:90%
it has implications for science.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:37.980 align:middle line:84%
It seems that for the
scientific community

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.540 align:middle line:84%
to be able to come to
terms with the many things

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking
about, and to understand

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the full realization possible
through the holographic model,

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:51.000 align:middle line:84%
and other comparable models
that are being developed now,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.390 align:middle line:84%
it's going to require a
level of personal development

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.880 align:middle line:84%
on the part of those
scientists or they just

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.060 align:middle line:90%
won't be able to get it.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:58.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm constantly
astounded, reading about some

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.792 align:middle line:84%
of the individuals, the men
who work on the atomic bomb.

00:51:03.792 --> 00:51:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're asked,
well, didn't you

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:06.542 align:middle line:90%
ever think of the implications?

00:51:06.542 --> 00:51:08.160 align:middle line:90%
They go, frankly, no.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:10%
You know, why?

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.200 align:middle line:10%
What has happened to us that
we can develop something,

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.510 align:middle line:10%
that a brilliant
mind can develop

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.778 align:middle line:10%
an atomic bomb without
thinking of the implications?

00:51:17.778 --> 00:51:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we don't
look at the larger picture.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.140 align:middle line:84%
They had their nose to the
grindstone, so to speak.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.440 align:middle line:84%
They were so interested
in the physics of it,

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.660 align:middle line:84%
they didn't think of what
the implications were.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, our world
is in desperate straits

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:31.880 align:middle line:84%
because we've done this
over and over again.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.630 align:middle line:84%
We've gone off in one
direction or another

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:37.152 align:middle line:84%
with just one value
parameter without--

00:51:37.152 --> 00:51:38.860 align:middle line:84%
like, well, this will
help us get energy,

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.940 align:middle line:84%
but it might destroy the
ozone layer, or whatever.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, we don't put these
spiritual values or deal--

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:48.880 align:middle line:84%
become conscious beings before
we start wielding these things.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, it's
why we seem to be

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.520 align:middle line:84%
like infants sitting at the
control panel of a jumbo jet.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.483 align:middle line:84%
We've got to learn
about what's inside

00:51:55.483 --> 00:51:57.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to control
this control panel

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.010 align:middle line:84%
before we start
flicking switches.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that isn't
just immoralism.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.280 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be directly
implied by the notion

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.740 align:middle line:84%
of a seamless universe,
that we can't separate

00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:12.480 align:middle line:84%
our personal growth, our moral
growth from our understanding

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of the world around us.

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.850 align:middle line:90%
We've reached that barrier.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:17.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bohm says that we have
to understand that the universe

00:52:17.475 --> 00:52:20.610 align:middle line:84%
is an unbroken hole, and that
when we don't, when we fragment

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:23.683 align:middle line:84%
the universe, we are leading
to our own destruction.

00:52:23.683 --> 00:52:25.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
look at, for example,

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.120 align:middle line:84%
poverty without
looking at education--

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.552 align:middle line:84%
and he applies it to
sociological things like this--

00:52:29.552 --> 00:52:32.010 align:middle line:84%
that you have to-- and we've
learned this in the ecosystem.

00:52:32.010 --> 00:52:34.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, ecologically you
can't say we can do this

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and it won't affect that.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything is infinitely
interconnected on every level,

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.820 align:middle line:84%
on every dynamical
level of reality.

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at the larger picture,

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.800 align:middle line:84%
at the infinite interconnections
without focusing

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.010 align:middle line:84%
in on a fragment of
this unbroken wholeness.

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:51.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Michael, I wonder--

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:53.500 align:middle line:84%
we've got about
five minutes left--

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:57.210 align:middle line:84%
if you could kind of synthesize
what we've been saying,

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and also talk about what is
the next frontier for you

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:01.890 align:middle line:90%
in this work?

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I'd like to do
next is I'm working on a book

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.340 align:middle line:84%
that is the practical
application of this holographic

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.070 align:middle line:84%
idea, you know, in all
of its various phases.

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Like talking about
the placebo effect--

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and I mentioned a study where
30% of the people taking

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:17.430 align:middle line:84%
the placebo of a
new chemotherapy

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.430 align:middle line:84%
lost their hair because
they were told that they

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:20.880 align:middle line:90%
might be taking a toxic drug.

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.370 align:middle line:84%
We've got to understand
that we have this--

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I call it the infinite
self inside us.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:28.740 align:middle line:84%
It has enormous capability,
but our conscious mind

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
feeds it all kinds
of things unwittingly

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:35.118 align:middle line:84%
and gives it all kinds
of mistaken directions.

00:53:35.118 --> 00:53:36.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, I live
in New York City.

00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And lot of people
say, well, don't you

00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:39.360 align:middle line:90%
think the air is killing you?

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.943 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I look at
that placebo study,

00:53:40.943 --> 00:53:43.602 align:middle line:84%
know that these people, just
that sentence, this drug may

00:53:43.602 --> 00:53:45.060 align:middle line:84%
cause you to lose
your hair, caused

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.268 align:middle line:84%
them to lose their hair when
they weren't even taking

00:53:47.268 --> 00:53:49.920 align:middle line:84%
the drug, that's the power
of our infinite self.

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We can cause ourself
to lose our own hair.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.470 align:middle line:84%
We can cause ourself to
respond in incredibly

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.330 align:middle line:84%
negative or incredibly
positive ways

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.090 align:middle line:84%
just by the model of reality
we hold inside our head.

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.680 align:middle line:90%
So one has to be very careful.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Like when people ask me
that about air pollution,

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:05.880 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, if I
believed I were dying,

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.987 align:middle line:84%
I know that my body
would respond in kind.

00:54:07.987 --> 00:54:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I want to write
a book that really

00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:11.820 align:middle line:84%
deals with all of these
things on all kinds of levels,

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.600 align:middle line:84%
saying here are the
practical applications,

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.070 align:middle line:84%
ways that you don't have
to deal with the very sort

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.688 align:middle line:84%
of heady, space-time
aspects of these things.

00:54:19.688 --> 00:54:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Here's the way these things can
impact in your everyday life,

00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and that you've got
to start looking

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:27.000 align:middle line:84%
at the wonder of these
things, but bring them down

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to the earthly
level, so to speak.

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:35.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm kind of puzzled by
that, because you use the term

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.810 align:middle line:90%
the infinite self.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And it almost
seems to me there's

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.500 align:middle line:84%
a little catch in there,
like if you believe

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.300 align:middle line:84%
you're going to die
from air pollution,

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or now we have
all these messages

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.377 align:middle line:90%
on cigarettes and on alcohol--

00:54:45.377 --> 00:54:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you know, drink this and
you'll get birth defects.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Or other problems, and we
think we're doing a good thing.

00:54:51.450 --> 00:54:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And it suggests
that we might want

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.640 align:middle line:90%
to re-examine some of that.

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.810 align:middle line:10%
But if we think in terms
of the infinite self,

00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:01.470 align:middle line:10%
maybe it's OK to
learn the hard way.

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very,
very delicate issue.

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example,
I'm not saying

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:09.180 align:middle line:90%
throw out nutritional knowledge.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.840 align:middle line:84%
But I now know that I try
to eat a healthy diet.

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.520 align:middle line:84%
But if I eat a candy
bar, I no longer

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.580 align:middle line:90%
tell myself this is killing me.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I bless everything
that goes into my body,

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and I say, this will
only make me better,

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:23.700 align:middle line:84%
even though another part of
me knows that I don't want

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.650 align:middle line:90%
to eat nothing but candy bars.

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.800 align:middle line:84%
But I tell myself that
everything that happens to me

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is affecting me in a positive
way, not a negative way,

00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.162 align:middle line:84%
because I know that the
value of doing this.

00:55:36.162 --> 00:55:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And the analogy that I use
here is the anthropologist

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:40.037 align:middle line:84%
Gregory Bateson was
in New Guinea, where

00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:84%
they use for a currency
these huge stone coins.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:46.318 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever a major
financial transaction

00:55:46.318 --> 00:55:47.860 align:middle line:84%
would take place,
they'd have to move

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.430 align:middle line:84%
one of these amazingly heavy
stone coins from one community

00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:51.383 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:55:51.383 --> 00:55:53.550 align:middle line:84%
During one of these events,
one of these stone coins

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.020 align:middle line:90%
sank to the bottom of the ocean.

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow who was
shipping it to another fellow

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.470 align:middle line:84%
said, well, everyone
knows where it is.

00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.030 align:middle line:84%
It's there down at the
bottom of the ocean.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:00.947 align:middle line:90%
It belongs to you now.

00:56:00.947 --> 00:56:02.160 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to get it.

00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:03.202 align:middle line:90%
The guy thought about it.

00:56:03.202 --> 00:56:04.843 align:middle line:84%
He said, OK, it's
my stone coin now.

00:56:04.843 --> 00:56:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And when he made a financial
transaction that necessitated

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:09.870 align:middle line:84%
shifting, moving a stone coin,
instead of moving it, he said,

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:10.860 align:middle line:90%
well, now, it belongs to you.

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows it's down there
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what we've
got to do with belief systems.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.505 align:middle line:84%
They continue to
use the same mode

00:56:16.505 --> 00:56:17.880 align:middle line:84%
of currency, but
without carrying

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.410 align:middle line:90%
the weight of the stone coins.

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to use our
nutritional knowledge

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:24.020 align:middle line:84%
without really affecting and
impacting the infant self.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We've got to carry the stone
coin around without the weight.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:90%
That's a very nice analogy.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And also, by way
of closing, I want

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.920 align:middle line:84%
to just mention what you said
a moment ago, that you always

00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:38.520 align:middle line:84%
bless your food, because it
seems that that represents

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:41.520 align:middle line:84%
an appreciation for the
larger, one might say

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.580 align:middle line:84%
holographic dimension, or
spiritual dimension of who

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:46.080 align:middle line:90%
we are and what our food is.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, mystics say that
everything is an expression

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:51.600 align:middle line:84%
of God, and nothing that is an
expression of God can hurt you.

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the ultimate message,

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.673 align:middle line:84%
that we have to look at
everything as so interconnected

00:56:56.673 --> 00:56:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can only look
at the positive aspects,

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:00.838 align:middle line:84%
even though a part of us
may sort of implicitly

00:57:00.838 --> 00:57:02.130 align:middle line:90%
recognize the negative aspects.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But we can't put
a charge on them,

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.020 align:middle line:84%
because that activates our own
belief systems, the placebo

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.270 align:middle line:84%
effect, a whole range of
things that start to create

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:10.680 align:middle line:90%
the hologram in that way.

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael Talbot, that's a
wonderful note to close on.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with me.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.030 align:middle line:90%
