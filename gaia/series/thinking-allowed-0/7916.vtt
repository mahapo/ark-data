conversations on the leading

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.280 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery,
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.080 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:31.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
Our topic today
is how to know God

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.410 align:middle line:90%
without the necessity of belief.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been talking with
physicist Russell Targ, author

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of five books, each of which has
the word "mind" in the title,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:84%
"Mind Reach," "The Heart of
the Mind," "Miracles of Mind,"

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:90%
"The Mind Race," and others.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.140 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Russell.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be with you.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.710 align:middle line:84%
>> In the first part of
this two-part series,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.210 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the principle
of nonlocality in science,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
a fundamental principle
which I think is a key

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
because we're in an era now
where science and spirituality

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:90%
are finding common ground.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:84%
For centuries, it
seemed as if science

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
struggled to distinguish
itself from the dogma

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:90%
of religious traditions.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, things seem to be
moving back the other way.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of progress is
made because what we understand

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is the experience of God
as a testable hypothesis.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.780 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to give up
your discerning mind in order

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to participate in the experience
of love, the experience of God,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.000 align:middle line:90%
that's available.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the Buddhist
tradition, or many meditative

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
traditions, they say if
you will quiet your mind

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and surrender to the
experience of God

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or surrender to the
experience of love,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
then you are likely to have
a certain kind of loving

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.650 align:middle line:84%
You'll reside in this loving
syrup that we've talked about.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And the teaching then is, after
you have done this practice,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
come back, write
me a lab report,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and let me know what
you experienced--

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:84%
does not require you to believe
in any panoply of superstition,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:90%
or deities, or anything else.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It's that you have this unit of
experience, this one with God

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
experience that's
available without having

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
to give up your
life as a scientist

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:90%
or a thoughtful person.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I think we ought
to point out that what

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about here is very
different from the sophomore

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
philosophy class in which
we explore, does God exist?

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Because from that
perspective, God

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.150 align:middle line:90%
is not a testable hypothesis.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the Buddhists
would say the same, too.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:90%
They would say God is--

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
there is no selfness to God.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The question of the existence
of God never gets anywhere.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The contribution of
the logical positivists

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
in the early 20th century,
Alfred Ayer and Ludwig

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.620 align:middle line:84%
Wittgenstein, probably the
most capable, intelligent

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
philosophers that
there have ever been,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.470 align:middle line:84%
said that nothing sensible
can say about God because God

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have any properties.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, they felt
that any discussion of God

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
was nonsense because there
was no sense data available.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
In their later years,
both Wittgenstein and Ayer

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
changed their minds somewhat.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
All their lives, they
were believers in data,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
but in the latter part
of Wittgenstein's life,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:84%
for example, in a book--
after the "Tractatus,"

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
he wrote a book,
"On Certainty"--

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.690 align:middle line:90%
what do we really know?

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And what he concluded is that
the experience of the mystics

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
actually could be
considered data.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
If all the mystics
throughout time

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
keep reporting the
same experience,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should believe
that they are actually

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:84%
having the experience
that they describe.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Wittgenstein
said that, if we

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
are going to find meaning in
our life, in space and time,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that meaning will come
outside of space and time.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, he decided
that these mystics

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.540 align:middle line:90%
may be onto something.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
>> William James, I
think, had a similar idea.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
James was the founder
of American psychology,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and he developed a concept
he called radical empiricism,

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:84%
in which he said, our
own inner experience

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.500 align:middle line:84%
is the most direct form of
reality that we can know.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.855 align:middle line:84%
It's primary, whereas sensory
experience is secondary.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I would agree with that.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to talk
endlessly about philosophers,

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
but CS Peirce, the pragmatist,
English pragmatist,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
who certainly was
nobody's fool, came

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
with a paper, "The
Neglected Proof

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.740 align:middle line:90%
for the Existence of God."

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And this neglected proof was the
fact that all of these mystics,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
from Buddha, to Patanjali, to
Jesus, Blake, Emerson, Ramana

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Maharshi, all of these
people who have inspired us

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.060 align:middle line:84%
throughout millennia,
have reported

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:90%
very similar experiences.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And what Peirce
pointed out is that you

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.250 align:middle line:90%
don't have to believe anything.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.640 align:middle line:84%
What these mystics are saying,
if you quiet your mind,

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
this particular kind of
experience is available.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's the experience
that throughout all

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
of mystic traditions, say,
is a unit of experience,

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
an in-love, one
with God experience,

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
and is testable and
independent of belief.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be independent
of any Sunday school version

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
of God, or the
deity, or the Bible.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It gets past the whole
idea of, does God exist?

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to argue
about God existing.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Jesus has told us that
God provides a peace that

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
passes understanding,
and that peace

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
is available as an experience
to anyone who can control

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.090 align:middle line:90%
their own mental chatter.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a sense in which God
transcends existence, in that,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I gather from what
you're saying,

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:84%
God is the ground
of all existence.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> In the-- I would
agree with that.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
In the perennial philosophy--
the perennial philosophy

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.980 align:middle line:84%
was brought to us throughout
the-- again, throughout all

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
the mystical
spiritual traditions,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and was codified by
Aldous Huxley in his book

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:90%
"The Perennial Philosophy."

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.120 align:middle line:84%
What is common to
any spiritual belief?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And he really had
four elements that

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
have become very current with
the advances in modern physics.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.680 align:middle line:84%
His first element of
the perennial philosophy

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we live in
a world that is more

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.220 align:middle line:84%
like a great thought
than a clockwork idea,

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that the universe is a nonlocal,
interconnected universe where

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.730 align:middle line:84%
all parts are connected
to one another.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
perennial philosophy

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
is the good news is that our
consciousness is also nonlocal,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.980 align:middle line:84%
so that within
our consciousness,

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
we are able to experience
and participate

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
in this expanded universe,
that we are not bodies.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:90%
We are awareness.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
We're a center of
awareness located

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.640 align:middle line:84%
in this body for this time,
and this awareness is nonlocal.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
It's able to experience
distant points in space, time,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:84%
because we live in a
nonlocal space and time.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
The third point comes from
our center of awareness

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than our
materiality, because we

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:90%
know that bodies come and go.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
But the data from
contemporary science--

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Ian Stevenson, for
example, a physician

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Virginia, shows

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
that there is an aspect
of our personality

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:90%
that survives bodily death.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And you're familiar
with this work,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
where children are born having
memories of a previous life.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking
about reincarnation.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
There is an aspect
that survives--

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.800 align:middle line:84%
often not much, so
I wouldn't put off

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:84%
any plans you want to
accomplish and say,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.390 align:middle line:90%
I'll do them next lifetime.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:90%
I think that's not prudent.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
But it's evident that this
awareness that we have,

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
this nonlocal awareness,
some aspect of that survives.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the meaning of
life, the thing that drives us,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
is what you were
asking about initially.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
What drives us and
gives our lives

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.970 align:middle line:84%
meaning is the opportunity
for this unit of experience,

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity to have
a nonlocal experience,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:84%
a one with God
experience, an opportunity

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.960 align:middle line:84%
to reside in this expanded
love that's available to us.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.225 align:middle line:84%
And then, what
people discover is

00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that the meaning of their
life comes with the desire

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:90%
to share that experience.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Russell, you speak
as one who has found a sense

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of peace, a sense of
bliss, and a sense of God.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And I know it--

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:84%
you didn't start
your career this way.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You weren't even
necessarily looking for this

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:90%
when you began.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.690 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:90%
I started as a physicist.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I was putting-- most
recently, I was putting lasers

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
on airplanes at
Lockheed Missiles

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and Space Company in the
heart of the weapons factory.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And we were looking out into the
future, out into the distance,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to find wind shear so the
airplane wouldn't crash.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The very hardware-- this is
remote viewing with lasers.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been a physicist
and an engineer all your life.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So something transformed
you along the way.

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Partially, it was the data,
and, partially, I suppose,

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.130 align:middle line:84%
it was your own personal quest
to make sense of that data.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was a gift of the
CIA that allowed me to spend

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.610 align:middle line:84%
a decade in the dark learning
to do remote viewing,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.460 align:middle line:84%
helping other people get
in touch with the part

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.440 align:middle line:90%
of themselves that's psychic.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's the discovery that this
nonlocal awareness is available

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
that led me to the--

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:12.260 align:middle line:84%
led me to the pursuit
of getting quiet.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.120 align:middle line:84%
In Silicon Valley,
for example, we

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.990 align:middle line:84%
find that people are
searching for happiness.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is looking to find some
kind of thing that will bring

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:90%
them what they're looking for.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
In Silicon Valley,
in general, it's

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:90%
something on the material plane.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
If I get a new house
or a new girlfriend

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.230 align:middle line:84%
or a new car, that will all--
that will bring me happiness,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.230 align:middle line:90%
is the thought.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.162 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that never
works, as that--

00:10:36.162 --> 00:10:37.370 align:middle line:90%
as a scientist, I could say--

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if these things
are a substitute for a deeper

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:90%
yearning that people have.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist, I could say
that experiment has been done.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And what's found
is that happiness

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:84%
that a person has in his
life ensues from his life

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:84%
experience, and that
happiness is not

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.807 align:middle line:84%
to be found on the
material plane.

00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:00.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell, we're
about to take a break--

00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --here.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Could say happiness
is an inside job.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll be back in just a few
moments with physicist Russell

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.646 align:middle line:90%
Targ.

00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:12.118 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jeffrey
Mishlove, and my guest

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:84%
is physicist Russell
Targ, author of "The Heart

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:90%
of the Mind" and other books.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
how you can know God

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:90%
without the necessity of belief.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And, Russell, you've
pointed out, really,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that there's a methodology here,
the methodology of quieting

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
the mind, of achieving
a state of serenity,

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.740 align:middle line:84%
of allowing one's self
to experience a kind

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
of ground of being of
the whole universe,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.133 align:middle line:84%
which you've
described as blissful.

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And we ended up with my
saying the idea that happiness

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:90%
is an inside job.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Viktor Frankl, who was
in a concentration camp,

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
was an inspired
writer who told us

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.160 align:middle line:84%
that we give all the meaning
it has to what we experience.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And while in the concentration
camp, being starved and badly

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
treated by the Nazis,
he created a psychology

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:90%
of optimism and spirituality.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, no matter what
they do to my physical body,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.750 align:middle line:84%
they can't take away
my spirituality,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:90%
my experience of God.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And what he pointed
out-- he was not a--

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
but he was Jewish, of
course, but he was not

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.520 align:middle line:84%
an orthodox or
particularly believing Jew.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:84%
He had the experience of
God, the experience of love

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.185 align:middle line:84%
in his life, and that experience
ensued throughout his life.

00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.090 align:middle line:84%
My sense is that once
you have that experience,

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:84%
you understand your deep
connection with the universe.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And for such a
person, at that point,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter whether you're
an atheist, or an agnostic,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.950 align:middle line:84%
or a religious
believer because you're

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
in touch with a reality that
transcends all theories.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think
that's certainly true.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
it's not sound to--

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
for anybody to be
an atheist today.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
To say you're an atheist
is a misunderstanding.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Even the logical positivists
were not atheists.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.050 align:middle line:90%
They said, we don't know.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:90%
But to be an--

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Buddhists
called them--

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.390 align:middle line:90%
say that there is Anatta.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.880 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:90%
There is no self.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It might not-- I think one could
argue that Buddhists are indeed

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:90%
atheists.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the Buddhists
are in love with the god--

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:90%
one of the Buddhist's deity--

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
I think there are different
kinds of Buddhism, as you know.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists are
in love with the god

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:90%
of compassion, Avalokitesvara--

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --the god who will come down
to you and be in your locus

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and bring you compassion.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
So to say that it's free of
deities is an overstatement.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
That is, people can pray to
this favorite compassionate god,

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.120 align:middle line:90%
even if you're a Buddhist.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Buddhists would
also say, I think, you know,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
that they don't exist--

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] either that they're--
that there is no self.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.020 align:middle line:90%
There's, like, an energy.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, coming
back to reality--

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> --what we observe is that
we have a center awareness,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.600 align:middle line:90%
is we are aware.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:90%
We're not physical bodies.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.510 align:middle line:84%
We're a center of awareness
residing in a physical body.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that your physical body
is a source of great suffering,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
especially in America, where
all the advertising we see

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.540 align:middle line:84%
is concerning physical
bodies and appearances

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and the hopelessness of
looking like Barbie, which

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:90%
is outside physical reality--

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.070 align:middle line:84%
the idea that the shape
of your physical body

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
determines who you are,
whereas what we know

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.080 align:middle line:84%
is that who you are is a
center of awareness temporarily

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:90%
residing in this body.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
many paradoxes here,

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
when we get into the
nature of the self,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:90%
the nature of the deity.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The expanded awareness we
were talking about is a clue

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.710 align:middle line:84%
that there is more to us than
the skin and bones and the meat

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and potatoes.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> By which you're referring
to our discussion in part 1,

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.730 align:middle line:84%
of extrasensory perception and
your decades of work in that

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking
about remote viewing,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
or the opportunity that we
have to look into the distance

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:33.150 align:middle line:84%
or look into the future, is a
clue that there's more to us

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
than the physicality that
you see sitting in a chair.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And the Hindu teacher
Patanjali, who

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.100 align:middle line:84%
was 300 years before
Christ, told his students

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and wrote in his books
the "Sutras of Patanjali,"

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
which are still available--

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
>> The Yoga Sutras.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> --that, as you
quiet your mind,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.020 align:middle line:84%
you will have these
interesting experiences.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
You will be able to
look into the distance,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
look into future
time, heal the sick,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
diagnose illnesses as part
of expanding your awareness.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
And he then went on
to say, now, don't

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.190 align:middle line:90%
get attached to these things.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:90%
This is just more phenomena.

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
But these phenomena show
that you are progressing

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:90%
on a spiritual path.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, the spiritual
path that you want

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to be on leads to
transcendence, leads

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:84%
to a unity-consciousness
experience.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:30.750 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali was a Hindu,
so he would probably

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
be happy saying that it was
a one with God experience.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
More contemporary,
Jesus might say

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's an in-love
experience, and Jesus taught us

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.020 align:middle line:90%
that God is love.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Contemporary teachers
like Ramana Maharshi,

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
who talked about
self-inquiry, would

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:55.290 align:middle line:84%
say that it's an opportunity
to experience who you are

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and surrender your story,
as giving up your story

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity to participate
in this expanded awareness,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:84%
to give up the
drive for happiness

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
on the material plane, but
rather to find happiness

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:12.900 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
So all of these mystics are
leading in the same direction.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they all
have in common is

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that they don't want
you to believe a thing.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:90%
They say, try this.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
This experience is available.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And you could say that God
is a testable hypothesis

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
in the spirit of all the
mystics, where they agree.

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're
suggesting to people,

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.380 align:middle line:84%
who may not know what
you're talking about,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.320 align:middle line:84%
that they can take some
simple steps to, well,

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:90%
discover for themselves.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the simple
steps, of course,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
involve first of all observing
that happiness is not going

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:84%
to be found on the
material plane.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.225 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a big
disappointment.

00:17:51.225 --> 00:17:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And you pointed out, even
meaning is not to be found

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:90%
in the material plane.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, because we give
the meaning for our experiences

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.660 align:middle line:90%
from our own choice.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
That is, what we
experience intrinsically

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any meaning
beyond what we give it.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:84%
But once we learn
to quiet our mind

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and to reside in this peaceful
place with a quiet mind,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
then we have an opportunity
for these experiences.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:84%
What we discover is
that love is available.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And in the interactions we
have with different people,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the interaction you
have from a person

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is either an expression of
love or a call for love.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Even the disagreeable
person one is working for

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
or the tired person at
the counter is not--

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.460 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hate you.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
He's just calling for love.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:90%
He's having a desperate day.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can greet
him with the idea

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.220 align:middle line:84%
that the nonlocal
awareness in you

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:56.640 align:middle line:84%
recognizes the nonlocal
awareness in him,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and that you are, in fact,
one, that you're connected.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So the metaphysics
that we are all one

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is today finding
a great coherence

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.890 align:middle line:84%
with modern physics
that says that we

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact,
nonlocal creatures,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
profoundly interacting with one
another across space and time.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And you earlier referred
to the idea of intentionality,

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as awareness, that when
we get in touch with what you

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:84%
refer to as our nonlocal self,
we have the facility to express

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.895 align:middle line:84%
a kind of joyful, exuberant,
loving, healing energy,

00:19:32.895 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:90%
and as part of our experience.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The nonlocality is the most
important message I could leave

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
That is, in modern
physics, we now

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
know that we live in
a nonlocal universe.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not to say that
extrasensory perception is

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:84%
explained by the fact that
distant photons are connected.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
In the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
experiment,

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.050 align:middle line:84%
we observe that these photons
traveling away from each other

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%
are connected.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And what that
shows us is that we

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:84%
live in a profoundly
interconnected world, quite

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.030 align:middle line:84%
compatible with the various
kinds of psychic things we see.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
The outflow of intention that
we see in spiritual healing

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
is another manifestation of
these nonlocal connections.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And more and more,
we see data published

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.080 align:middle line:84%
in prestigious medical journals
that healers across the country

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
can pray for cardiac
patients or AIDS patients,

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
and in the experiments--

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:84%
recently, my daughter,
Elizabeth Targ,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
did experiments at California
Pacific Medical Center.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And with 60 very sick
men, the half, the 30 men,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:84%
who were the
recipients of prayers

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.430 align:middle line:90%
had much better outcomes.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
They had fewer
opportunistic illnesses,

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.710 align:middle line:84%
fewer trips to the
hospital, fewer

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
days in the hospital, better
self-reports of how they feel.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.335 align:middle line:84%
And these were
double-blind studies,

00:20:58.335 --> 00:21:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that no one in the hospital,
including the patients,

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
knew who was
receiving the prayers.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But at the end, where
there was a review

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.550 align:middle line:84%
of the charts, the people
for whom the distant prayers,

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
those distant people
were able to have

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
an effect on the
physical well-being

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:90%
of the people in the hospital.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was published in the
"Western Medical Journal,"

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and similar studies
with cardiac patients

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.330 align:middle line:84%
have been published in "Annals
of Medicine" and "Southern

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Medical Journal," involving many
hundreds of cardiac patients.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's absolutely
evident that the effects

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
of these distant people
are having an effect.

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So the message is that, even
if you don't believe in prayer,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.490 align:middle line:84%
and somebody offers
to pray for you,

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:45.780 align:middle line:90%
you should accept the prayers.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
It seems to work, even if
you don't believe in it.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And your daughter,
Elizabeth Targ,

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:84%
one of the country's leading
researchers in this area,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
is scheduled to be a
guest on this program.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That should be a
very interesting show.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, Russell, we've covered
a lot of ground here.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
remote viewing.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
psychic healing.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've gone deeper into the
relationship between science

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and spirituality and a
fundamental methodology

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.060 align:middle line:84%
that you're proposing
any of our listeners

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
can use to prove to themselves
that the perennial message

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of mystics and spiritual
teachers is correct.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's available, and
it's readily available.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
believe a thing.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:84%
If, when you pop your
eyes open in the morning,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.220 align:middle line:84%
if you can wake up in gratitude,
wake up saying thank you,

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than waking up in our
customary fear, and anxiety,

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and resentment,
and desperation--

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.030 align:middle line:84%
if you can wake up in gratitude,
it can start your whole day

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:90%
in a day of grace.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell Targ, thank you
so much for being with me.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.790 align:middle line:84%
This has been an enlightening
time, a joyful time,

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
and one that's been inspiring to
me and I'm sure to our viewers.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
