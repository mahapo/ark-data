>> "Thinking Allowed,"
conversations on the leading

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:31.613 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
explore how to know God

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.630 align:middle line:90%
without the need for belief.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.000 align:middle line:84%
My guest is physicist
Russell Targ,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.460 align:middle line:84%
who has written five
books, each of which

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
has the word "mind" in the
title, "Mind Reach," "The Mind

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Race," "Mind at Large," and more
recently, "Miracles of Mind,"

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:90%
and "The Heart of the Mind."

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Russell.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm very happy to
be with you today.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you again.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Your focus recently
has been that one

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.470 align:middle line:84%
can have a direct
experience of God

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.390 align:middle line:90%
without any need for belief.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you particularly
are interested in addressing

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
this point to people
such as yourself

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
in the high tech and
science professions, who

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
are not particularly
prone to religious belief.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:10%
>> I live in Silicon Valley,
which is filled with science,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:10%
technicians, and restaurants,
and Silicon Valley people would

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:10%
rather suffer any kind of
pain than be caught believing

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:10%
anything silly.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:10%
So in our book, which was the
outgrowth of a lot of research

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.650 align:middle line:10%
in psychic abilities,
we discovered--

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.840 align:middle line:10%
my personal experience
is that it's

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:10%
possible to have a
direct experience of God

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:10%
or an ability to reside in
love without having to believe

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.660 align:middle line:10%
anything that would be offensive
to the discerning 21st century

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:10%
mind.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a concept
that has become very prominent

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
in physics in the last decade
or two that seems to be quite

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
relevant to your interest,
the notion of nonlocality.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably the most
interesting thing that I know

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
as a physicist is the idea that
we live in a nonlocal world.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
In physics, this
pertains to the idea

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that photons sent off
in opposite directions

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.000 align:middle line:84%
travel away from each other
at the speed of light,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but are still interconnected,
so that if you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
turn a polarizer that looks
at a photon on the left,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
the photon on the right still
has to assume the position

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and notices that its
twin has been collected,

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
even though these things are
traveling away from each other

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.650 align:middle line:90%
at the speed of light.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Henry Stapp, a distinguished
physicist at UC Berkeley,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
said recently that the
discovery of nonlocality

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
is perhaps the most important
fact learned in all of science

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
because it is different than
our ordinary, naive-realist

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:90%
picture.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.690 align:middle line:84%
It shows that we are
connected to one another

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness and in
nature, even to things

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.180 align:middle line:90%
that appear to be far away.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in all fairness, there
are many physicists who try

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
to integrate this notion of
nonlocality without having it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.780 align:middle line:84%
disrupt their complete
world picture.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Many materialists
accept the data

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
that you have just presented,
and there's still materialists.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, certainly, that I'm not
requiring that anybody give up

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:84%
their laboratory
materialist view.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
What we discover is that
the idea of nonlocality

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
is coherent with what the
ancient Vedic scholars taught

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:90%
2,500 years ago.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.480 align:middle line:84%
The earliest mystics who
sat peacefully on a rock

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
told us that if you
quiet your mind,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.030 align:middle line:84%
you notice that separation is
an illusion, that we are not

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:90%
separated from one another.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This is consonant with
the Buddhist teachings,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
the teachings of Patanjali,
teachings of Jesus,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.200 align:middle line:84%
who said that the peace
that passes understanding

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:90%
is available to us--

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
does not require you
to believe anything.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.600 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
you can observe.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.230 align:middle line:84%
It's available to
the quiet mind.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.149 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I seem to
recall, Russell,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
in "Scientific American,"
maybe as far back as 1969

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
or so, Henri Costa de Beauregard
wrote an article when he first

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
reported on the kind of data
to which you're referring,

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:90%
in which he said--

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.670 align:middle line:84%
now often talked about in
terms of Bell's theorem

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
or the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky
paradox.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, he said that
the fundamental distinction,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:84%
which we all hold in our
everyday reality to be basic,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.900 align:middle line:84%
the difference between
subject and object,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
me and that which is not
me, that that distinction is

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:90%
breaking down in physics.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's an
illusion in physics,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's also an illusion
with regard to our psychology

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:90%
and our personal experience.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
In physics, the
subject-to-object apparent

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
disharmony was broken down
by Niels Bohr and the idea

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of complementarity because
what you expect to see

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:90%
is what you get.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:84%
If you look at
photons with a prism,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
light with a prism,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.350 align:middle line:84%
you'll see that the prism
breaks the light down

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.820 align:middle line:90%
into beautiful colors.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it with a
photodetector, electron

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.090 align:middle line:84%
multiplier photo tube, you
collect one photon at a time,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.950 align:middle line:84%
and it'll go click,
click, click.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein calculated
how to determine the energy

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
of the photon from that.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So what you observe, the
nature of light you observe,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is a result of what you
bring to the experiment.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It's as though, in our
personal relationships,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
for example, we give
all the meaning it

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.600 align:middle line:90%
has to whatever we experience.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.530 align:middle line:84%
This is also
ancient Vedic ideas.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, what we see
has no intrinsic meaning,

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.370 align:middle line:84%
depending on what we
bring to it with regard

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:84%
to our personality, our
preconceptions, and our views,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:84%
and our scientific
instruments is a determinant

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:90%
of what we get to see.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, I recently
took an airplane trip,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
and the clerk behind the
counter had to tell me

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.180 align:middle line:90%
that my plane was canceled.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could come to her
with the idea of namaste.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.890 align:middle line:84%
That is, the divine in me
meets the divine in you

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
because we are one
in consciousness.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
We all are children
of God, you could say.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.950 align:middle line:84%
We're certainly connected in
a mind-to-mind connection.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So namaste says that there is a
transcendent aspect of me that

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.450 align:middle line:84%
meets the transcendent
aspect of you,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.970 align:middle line:84%
and we can have a
namaste experience.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Regardless of the
flight being cancelled.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Or I can be upset, and I can
have an interaction where

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.280 align:middle line:84%
the jackass in me meets
the jackass in you,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we can have
a jackass experience.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's my choice.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I have the-- the observable
is the plane is canceled,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
and I then get to choose
what kind of experience

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:90%
I'll make out of that.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you seem
to be suggesting,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
back to our original theme of
the direct knowledge of God,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that an acknowledgment
of a connection,

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
an acknowledgment
of bliss, harmony,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that that somehow is more godly
than an experience of anger.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:10%
>> The experience of
anger lies on a continuum.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:10%
And, again, my theme is
that we get to choose.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:10%
Having worked in
aerospace for a decade

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:10%
and Silicon Valley
for 30 years, I

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.620 align:middle line:10%
observed that there is this
continuum from desperation,

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:10%
resentment, fear, and anger
that we wake up with each day,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.350 align:middle line:10%
or we can wake up in gratitude
and forgiveness and love.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:10%
And we interestingly
get to choose.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
We pop our eyes
open in the morning,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:84%
and you can say thank
you to the universe

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
or to God for the undeserved
good fortune you have

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
to live in Northern California,
or to be intelligent, or to be

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.540 align:middle line:90%
healthy.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
You didn't do anything
for those gifts.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
A Christian would say
this is a result of grace.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:90%
The Spanish would say gracias.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But you wake up, and
you say thank you,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:84%
or you can fall into the
chaotic attractor pit

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:90%
by the side of your bed.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
When you step out, you fall into
your usual fearful pit one can,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.100 align:middle line:84%
pertaining to
mortgages, requirements

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.193 align:middle line:84%
of jobs that are too little
time, too little money.

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
choice where you're

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:90%
going to reside that day.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
The quiet mind, the
result of taking control

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:84%
of our ongoing chatter, allows
you to reside in a loving space

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and have occasional awakened
moments throughout the day

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
as you reside in love.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the Hindu tradition,
as I understand it,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
suggests that not
only is all one,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that there is no separation,
but that the essence of that

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.790 align:middle line:90%
oneness is bliss.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
It is joy, that that
experience of bliss and joy

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.970 align:middle line:90%
is an experience of reality.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
I think other traditions--
the Buddhists might say, no,

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.500 align:middle line:84%
even that's a projection, that
ultimate reality is nothing.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:90%
It has no quality.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that what we observe,
certainly from my research

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:43.450 align:middle line:84%
in extrasensory perception, is
that our consciousness is not

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:90%
limited to the physical body.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.160 align:middle line:84%
That is, we have
expanded awareness,

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and we are able to
describe and experience

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
many things that are located
far away from us and even

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And this expanded awareness
shows that there is more to us

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:84%
than a physical
body, that there is

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
an aspect to us that transcends
our ordinary physical data.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of this I
can say as a physicist

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.940 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not asking you
to believe any nonsense.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
The data for our remote
viewing, our distant viewing

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
experiments, was published
in the most prestigious

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
scientific journals in the
world, "Nature," proceedings

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.600 align:middle line:84%
of the engineering society,
American Academy of Sciences,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It has been replicated
in laboratories

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.080 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that we
have expanded awareness

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and are able to quiet our
mind to have these expanded

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.120 align:middle line:84%
awareness experiences
is something

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
that's available to any person.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And what you discover is
that when you quiet your mind

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to go into this experience, is
that you have the opportunity

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to reside in the loving place
that the mystics talk about.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
loving place described

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:03.980 align:middle line:84%
by Patanjali, Jesus, Blake,
Emerson, and all the mystics.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The mystics all agree that
the quiet mind has this loving

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:90%
place as a place to reside.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Russell, you've spent
your lifetime as a scientist

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.650 align:middle line:84%
exploring extrasensory
perception, healing,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:84%
and other aspects
of the paranormal,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
so you certainly know
what you're talking about.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:25.940 align:middle line:90%
We're about to take a break.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll be back
after a few moments,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.590 align:middle line:84%
and when we come
back, let's focus

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
in a little more on what you've
discovered in your career

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.146 align:middle line:90%
as a paranormal researcher.

00:11:38.146 --> 00:11:41.492 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm your host, Jeffrey
Mishlove, and we're

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:84%
talking with
physicist Russell Targ

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.310 align:middle line:84%
about how to know God without
the necessity of belief.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Russell is a parapsychology
researcher and author

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:84%
of five books,
including most recently

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:90%
"The Heart of the Mind."

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Russell, you actually
for over a decade

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.550 align:middle line:84%
conducted research
in remote viewing

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
funded by the
military intelligence

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:90%
establishment and the CIA.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
You could say that I was
a psychic spy for the CIA

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and found God, as my path
was a gift from the Central

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:90%
Intelligence Agency.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:10%
They arranged my life for me
so that I could sit quietly

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:10%
in a dark room at Stanford
Research Institute,

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:10%
teach people how to get in touch
with the part of themselves

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:10%
that were psychic,
and lead people

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:10%
into psychic experiences.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:10%
So I had a decade as a kind
of psychic travel agent,

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:10%
where I would guide
people to be in touch

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:10%
with their mental pictures
regarding what was going on

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.260 align:middle line:10%
in the far reaches of Soviet
Union, or Siberia, or Iran,

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.690 align:middle line:10%
or across town in Palo Alto.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:10%
We would help people
describe and experience

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:10%
what was happening, where
a distant person was hiding

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.040 align:middle line:10%
or at distant
geographical coordinates.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:10%
As a result of that,
I would be in harmony

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.700 align:middle line:10%
or try and make my mind
coherent with the person who

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:10%
I was guiding in the
remote viewing experience.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:24.560 align:middle line:10%
So it was really a decade
of mind-quieting experience

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:10%
that I got to have, as I would
teach each of these people

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:10%
how to do remote viewing.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And these were not
necessarily gifted people.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We supported our
program year after year

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:84%
by showing government
scientists and administrators,

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
right up to the
undersecretary of Defense.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.100 align:middle line:84%
We would get the undersecretary,
who would come to us and say,

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:90%
I've come to California.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:90%
Show me something psychic.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:90%
Who's a psychic?

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would tell
him that, you are,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and I would show him how to
describe his own experiences

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.097 align:middle line:84%
with regard to where his
adjutant had been taken.

00:14:02.097 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And, of course,
neither he nor I would

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:90%
have any idea where that was.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, at the
end of that trial,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.630 align:middle line:84%
we would take him to wherever
the people were hiding,

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and he would then
get to decide, did

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
his drawings and his
experience correspond

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:90%
to this distant place?

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's not as though we
showed him some psychic data

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.080 align:middle line:90%
by some mystery person.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
He had his own experience,
and he would then

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.170 align:middle line:84%
take that experience
back to Washington

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:84%
so that he would know
that he wasn't deceived,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that he genuinely did describe
where his associate had

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:90%
been hiding that day.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.680 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of that, I was
given a lot of opportunity

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:84%
to explore the realms
of the quiet mind,

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to then
carry that into my practice,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:90%
into my life.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I would show people how
to look upon a blank slate,

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
I was then able to learn to
deal with my own mental chatter.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:07.130 align:middle line:84%
This is not that I developed
some complicated meditative

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.810 align:middle line:90%
procedure.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:84%
But rather, once you
have a quiet mind,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
you have an opportunity
to introspect

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and go into the aspects
of self inquiry,

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:25.190 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself who you are, and as
the teachers of old would say,

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
who are you, and
who wants to know?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And you get into a
quiet period where

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.360 align:middle line:84%
you have an opportunity to
reside in a very loving space.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of
oceanic experiences

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:42.387 align:middle line:84%
that the mystics have talked
about all throughout millennia.

00:15:42.387 --> 00:15:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's as though you
have an opportunity

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
to reside in an
overwhelming, loving syrup.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I know it's hard to--

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
this is beyond boyfriends
and girlfriends.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It's the opportunity
to reside in love.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus described it most clearly,
as the love is a peace that

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:90%
passes understanding.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.950 align:middle line:84%
In the Christian tradition,
both Jesus and Paul

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:90%
say that God is love.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:10%
>> You find it in many
traditions-- in fact, I think,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:10%
in every tradition.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:10%
But the intriguing
thing to me is

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.320 align:middle line:10%
when you started this
research, the premise

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:10%
behind parapsychology
is that we're

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.100 align:middle line:10%
dealing with a phenomenon
that can be mapped and tested

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:10%
using the empirical methods
of physical science.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And, surely,
military intelligence

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
had an interest because
they saw that it

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
would have practical purposes
to large organizations,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:90%
such as the government.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Week after week, we would do on
the one hand application tasks

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
for the CIA--

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
describe what's happening
in a distant place,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and what we describe
would then be verified

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:90%
by satellite photography.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of our
principal successes,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
a retired policeman, Pat Price,
described a weapons facility

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.770 align:middle line:84%
in the Soviet Union, given only
the geographical coordinates.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that a giant crane
was rolling back and forth

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
over a building, and
that crane was verified

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
by satellite photography.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.190 align:middle line:84%
He then described the
fabrication of a giant steel

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:90%
sphere inside the building.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
And he described
that in enough detail

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
so that we could
figure out that this

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of
a particle beam weapon

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
to shoot down the satellites
that were, in fact, taking

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:90%
these pictures.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And this led to a
Congressional investigation

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to see if there was
a security leak that

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
might have given
this information that

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.345 align:middle line:84%
was unknown at the time
in the Western world.

00:17:39.345 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, no
security leak was found.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, this success
was significantly responsible

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:84%
for the next decade
of our support.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So you started out with
the premise of using psychic

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.790 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon within a
materialistic scientific

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:84%
perspective for
practical purposes,

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
and you ended up becoming
a mystic and a lover of God

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.970 align:middle line:90%
and a lover of humanity.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a mystic is much
maligned in our society.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.720 align:middle line:84%
A mystic, in general,
throughout history,

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.990 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
Vedic times, thousands

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of years before
Christ-- a mystic

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
is not a believer,
because we think today

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:84%
that a mystic believes all
kinds of crazy, new age stuff.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:84%
That's not at all
what a mystic--

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.450 align:middle line:84%
a mystic is a person who has had
an experience that connects him

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with a transcendent experience
beyond his ordinary life.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:84%
When, for example,
in the Christian--

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
I grew up Jewish, so in
the Christian tradition,

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.170 align:middle line:84%
I heard people say
that God is love.

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that's something
that Christians say just

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.470 align:middle line:84%
to annoy the nonbelievers
because the idea of God

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:90%
as love is never unpacked.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
It's never explained, what
that could possibly be.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
But as you get in contact with
the mystic literature, what

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
you discover is that this
experience of love as a place

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to reside, rather
than something to do,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
is the essence of the mystic
experience from the earliest

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.000 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And from the perspective
of practical applications,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.210 align:middle line:84%
it's also the basis
of distant healing.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It seems to be.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:84%
In remote viewing, you
inflow information,

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
as we've discussed, and you can
experience things in the future

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And as you know, we use psychic
abilities to forecast changes

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.350 align:middle line:10%
in the silver commodity market.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:10%
In fact, my co-author
Jane Katra and I

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:41.730 align:middle line:10%
did a series of silver
forecasts for our publisher.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:10%
Publisher said, if
you're telling people

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.810 align:middle line:10%
how to be psychic,
it would be nice

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.780 align:middle line:10%
if you would demonstrate that
the authors could actually

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:10%
do something.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:10%
And in a 9-week--

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:10%
or I guess a 12-week
period, we made 12 forecasts

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:01.022 align:middle line:10%
for changes in the silver
commodity market, changes

00:20:01.022 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:10%
in the price of silver.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that you were
overseeing those experiments,

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.860 align:middle line:84%
and your mild-mannered
authors had

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:84%
11 out of 12 successes
forecasting silver futures.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So this is not an
airy-fairy ability.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:84%
It's an ability that we
could all be in touch with

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and shows that our
dreams, for example,

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.150 align:middle line:84%
reflect events in the
future that cause us to have

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.900 align:middle line:90%
a dream at present time.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.280 align:middle line:10%
It indicates that we don't
understand our causality.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.300 align:middle line:10%
So in looking into the future
and looking into the distance,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:10%
you inflow information.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.820 align:middle line:10%
In the spiritual healing
you were just talking about,

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.720 align:middle line:10%
you outflow your
mental intention

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.880 align:middle line:10%
or your spiritual wishes for
the health of a distant person.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:10%
It's between the
inflow of information

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:10%
and the outflow of intention
that these loving experiences

00:20:58.930 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:10%
occur.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the quiet moment between
the inflow and the outflow

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that we have an opportunity
to know God, to be in love.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And what you're saying,
then, if I hear you correctly,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the path of the mystic,
the path of one who experiences

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.900 align:middle line:84%
oneness and bliss, is not
at all in contradiction with

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.070 align:middle line:84%
the practical life that one
can lead in this world, with,

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, a life in the world
of business or in science.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not in contradiction,
but what happens is that

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:84%
the life of business
becomes less interesting,

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
because we're all looking
for happiness, of course.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, the good news is that if
you live in Silicon Valley,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
as we do, these days, there
are multitudinous opportunities

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:84%
to make money doing surprising,
inventive, different kinds

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.660 align:middle line:84%
of computer-oriented
kinds of things.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And what you discover is that,
as you spend time in love

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
with a quiet mind, that those
things become less interesting.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, as you recall, when
we did the silver forecasting,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
people said, this
looks wonderful.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
You got 11 out of 12 hits
in the silver market.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into the
market with major money

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.630 align:middle line:90%
and make our fortunes.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But my co-author
Jane and I said,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
yes, we could probably do that.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
That just doesn't
feel like what we

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.870 align:middle line:90%
want to do with our quiet mind.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not that God won't let
us use our ESP to make money,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:84%
because we have certainly done
that in previous experiments.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.270 align:middle line:84%
It's just not what the
quiet-minded person

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:90%
feels he wants to do.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Russell Targ, what a pleasure
talking to you about these

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.300 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoy your grasp of
both the heart and the mind

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.610 align:middle line:84%
coming together here to
understand our oneness,

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.120 align:middle line:90%
our connection with everything.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.500 align:middle line:10%

for being with us.
