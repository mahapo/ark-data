Peter Russell explains that for years, the idea of consciousness was ignored by the scientific community. Recently, scientists have begun trying to provide a scientific explanation of consciousness, to no avail. Russell argues that they are asking the wrong question.  \r\n\r\nIf we believe the material world is real, as many do, then we believe that it must be the cause of consciousness and perceptions. Russell says that consciousness cannot be explained through our belief of the material world, because the material world that we perceive is nothing more than a recreation that our mind makes. In the end, the only thing we can be sure of is our consciousness, not of the material world.\r\n\r\nSee also: Part 2","teaser":"Host Jeffrey Mishlove talks with Peter Russell, author of From Science to God, about how to reconcile consciousness and the material world.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/551cf7bd-a395-4621-b939-dc49de2780d6/2270_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt1_w_peter-russell_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/00465d7f-d2ad-4d9e-85d1-a1901b1ef09e/2270_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt1_w_peter-russell_clean_16x9.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/00465d7f-d2ad-4d9e-85d1-a1901b1ef09e/2270_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt1_w_peter-russell_clean_16x9.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/00465d7f-d2ad-4d9e-85d1-a1901b1ef09e/2270_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt1_w_peter-russell_clean_16x9.jpg"}},{"seriesId":3367,"seriesTitle":"Thinking Allowed","seriesPath":"series/thinking-allowed-0","seriesVoteDownCount":31,"seriesVoteUpCount":203,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/c15ffd81-9836-4833-91b1-53c6889595ab/1125_FromScienceToGod.jpg","created":"2010-09-22","episode":8,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/23f15970-3845-4ed5-a94b-1f525261791d/2459_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt2_w_peter-russell_16x9.jpg","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/4dc29654-9264-4f22-9523-3b9c27f27ac3/2459_thinking-allowed_the-science-to-god_pt2_w_peter-russell_clean_16x9.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/science-god-peter-russell-part-2","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/c15ffd81-9836-4833-91b1-53c6889595ab/1125_FromScienceToGod.jpg","published":true,"season":1,"title":"From Science to God (Peter Russell) – Part 2","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":2,"voteUpCount":17,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":41,"seasonCount":2,"preview":{"duration":66,"mediaId":9606,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":9606,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1408,"mediaId":9321,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":9321,"isFree":false},"id":2459,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Could there be a scientific explanation of consciousness that is outside the realm we consider reality?

This is why it is impossible for mass to move at the speed of light; mass would reach infinity, requiring an infinite amount of energy to move it, which doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nLight, however, does move at the speed of light.

Russell Targ, physicist and author of The Heart of the Mind, explores how to know God for those who are not particularly prone to belief. \r\n\r\nThrough his own meticulous research into psychic abilities and personal experience, Russell explains that it is possible to have a direct experience of God or to reside in love without having to believe anything that would be offensive to the discerning modern scientific mind. What we discover is that the idea of non-locality in physics is coherent with what the ancient Vedic and mystic scholars taught 2500 years ago – that if you sit and observe you'll notice that separateness is an illusion. \r\n\r\nCentral to the teachings of the Buddha, Jesus, Patanjali and many others, the experiential truth that we are all one is now discernible via science as well as through religious or mystical belief.\r\n\r\nSee also: Part 2","teaser":"Can you have a direct experience of God without the need for belief?
