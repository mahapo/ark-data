>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Today we'll be exploring the

My guest is Dr. Alberto
Villoldo, a psychologist

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.520 align:middle line:10%
and medical anthropologist
and author of numerous books,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.720 align:middle line:10%
including "Realms of Healing,"
"Dance of the Four Winds,"

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:10%
"Island of the Sun," and
"Shaman, Healer, Sage."

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Alberto is founder and director
of the Four Winds Society.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Alberto.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeff.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.980 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you again.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.880 align:middle line:84%
Your work is very
intriguing to me

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
because you've managed
to immerse yourself

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
in the culture of the
Andean priesthood,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.800 align:middle line:84%
the shamanistic traditions
of Latin America,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:84%
particularly of
the Peruvian Andes.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a culture that up
until recent decades

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
was sort of invisible
to the Western world.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, the Western world
hasn't been looking for these

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:10%
cultures very much.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:10%
They've been intent on
exterminating them because they

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.550 align:middle line:10%
are traditions of the
Earth and of the feminine,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.790 align:middle line:10%
and very much in contrast
with the Western traditions ,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:10%
which are very much
of the masculine.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:10%
Our science is very
reductionistic.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:10%
It's not one of networking
and communion with.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.595 align:middle line:84%
And these are the ways
of the feminine Earth.

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
It's curious.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we're
the only people

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.617 align:middle line:84%
that were ever kicked out
of the garden of Eden.

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
traditions of people

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.600 align:middle line:84%
that still live in
the garden, that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
still speak with God, that
still talk to the rivers

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:90%
and to the trees.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's always been
a rift between those

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
who live outside
the garden and those

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.460 align:middle line:90%
who still dwell within it.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And after spending a
long time investigating

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
the mind-body
healing in the West,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I decided to jump over the
fence and spend some time

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.340 align:middle line:84%
with the people that
still lived in the garden.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You were fortunate enough
to find a teacher who was both

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:84%
an experienced shaman of the
highest initiation and also

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
a professor.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And the intriguing
thing is that he claims,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
if I understand the story, that
he found you or he brought you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.003 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I thought I was
the one who discovered him.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
became a mouthpiece,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.710 align:middle line:84%
a contemporary mouthpiece for
a 100,000 year old tradition

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge and power that
is really very relevant today.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.260 align:middle line:90%
It's very contemporary.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a tradition of stewardship.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the
post-industrial paradigm

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have been
looking for that it's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
right here in the Americas.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you use these
words, knowledge and power.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think many
of our listeners

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
may assume that we understand
what knowledge and power are.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But you are using them
in a particular way,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
not I think in the way we
normally use those terms.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.000 align:middle line:84%
In the shamanic traditions,
in the medicine traditions,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
there is a differentiation
between information

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.620 align:middle line:84%
When I went to the
Amazon and the Andes,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I was finishing my
PhD, and my mentor

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
would say to me, Alberto,
you have so much information,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.160 align:middle line:90%
but such little knowledge.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And information is
knowing that water is H2O.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is being
able to make it rain.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.120 align:middle line:84%
We know how to describe the
nature of illness and disease.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:90%
We're excellent at diagnosing.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Knowledge is being able to heal.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And my mentor told
me that you had

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.588 align:middle line:90%
to be able to grow corn with it.

00:04:10.588 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:90%
You couldn't grow corn with it.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.880 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful that we can
describe through quantum

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:84%
physics all these
extraordinary states that

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.290 align:middle line:84%
are available to
us, but the shaman

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.143 align:middle line:90%
is actually able to do them.

00:04:21.143 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
You've got to grow
corn with them.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.200 align:middle line:90%
They have to be practical.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Your teacher,
Antonio Morales,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.910 align:middle line:84%
deceived you in
some ways, though.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even let you
know that he was a master

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
shaman until you were well
along in your work with him.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, he was a trickster.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.310 align:middle line:10%
He was a trickster.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.790 align:middle line:10%
He didn't let me know that
he had a PhD until I knew how

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:10%
to add and I knew the alphabet.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:10%
So at that point, I was
ready to truly engage him

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.660 align:middle line:10%
in writing poetry.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that he
taught you in the early stages

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
of your work with him was to see
what you might call a luminous

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.320 align:middle line:84%
body, a completely different
form of vision than we are

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.140 align:middle line:90%
accustomed to in the West.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what he
taught me was a map,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
a very ancient map to healing
and transformation that's known

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.660 align:middle line:84%
as the medicine wheel that has
four steps to becoming a person

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
is to heal yourself,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
but to heal yourself
really at the source,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.180 align:middle line:84%
not at the level of the symptom
but at the level of the source

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.010 align:middle line:84%
of that luminous body, that
luminous envelope that informs

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
and organizes the physical
body in the same way

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that the energy
fields of a magnet

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.680 align:middle line:84%
will organize iron filings
on a piece of glass.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
We can move the iron filings
around as much as we want,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
but until we are able to
shift the architecture

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of those fields of
that magnet, we're not

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.030 align:middle line:90%
going to have lasting change.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:84%
We can remove a cancerous
tumor, but if you

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:84%
don't erase it
from the blueprint,

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:90%
it's going to re-manifest.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you
erase a blueprint,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint informs
the physical body

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.230 align:middle line:90%
and brings about health.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now you're describing
this 100,000-year-old tradition

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the four directions
of the Inca medicine wheel.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I began by talking about
the luminous body, which you

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:90%
might say it's a phenomenon.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And psychics and shamans
report on phenomenon.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
But what you're suggesting
by bringing up this approach

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
is that a true shaman
in this tradition

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.410 align:middle line:84%
is engaging in a very ancient
and holistic path of knowledge.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not a question
of knowing a few tricks

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
or experiencing
a few phenomenon.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
It is a question of growing into
a highly evolved and developed

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.260 align:middle line:90%
tradition that incorporates--

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>> An extraordinarily evolved
tradition that has been

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.040 align:middle line:84%
dismissed in the West because
there is no written tradition

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
in the Americas.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
So the assumption was,
there was no writing--

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.010 align:middle line:90%
these people are illiterate.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And we know that if you're
literate, you're stupid.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And this, of course,
has not been the case.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:84%
This is part of the
systemic extermination

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.400 align:middle line:90%
of these traditions.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.420 align:middle line:84%
You know that what drew me
to Peru, aside from the fact

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.400 align:middle line:84%
that it was the only
country where there were

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
indigenous peoples
left in large numbers,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.880 align:middle line:84%
was the fact that there
was still an operating

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Office of the Inquisition.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I recall
reading about that.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's still being
run by the Dominicans,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:84%
by the same people that burnt
Joan of Arc at the stake.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.090 align:middle line:10%
And it's called the Office for
the Extrications of Idolatries.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:10%
The only place in the world.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.157 align:middle line:10%
It's been open for 500 years.

00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:03.740 align:middle line:10%
And they still have
a lot of business.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's one of
the reasons, I suppose,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:10%
that the shamans in Peru
remained invisible for so long.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:10%
>> Correct.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:10%
Correct.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the same reason that
Christianity survived

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:90%
by going into the catacombs.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:90%
They went underground.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And the medicine traditions
both in North America

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and in South America
also became invisible.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:10%
But these are the
traditions of the builders

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:10%
of Machu Picchu, of the
builders of extraordinary cities

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:10%
in the clouds, of
amazing astronomers,

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.690 align:middle line:10%
of mathematicians, and of
a lineage that devolved,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.409 align:middle line:10%
evolved a very carefully crafted
spiritual methodology as rich

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:10%
as the Tibetan.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I have had the
privilege of visiting Peru,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:10%
and I was struck when I was
there by a place in Cusco

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:10%
called the Temple of the Sun.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:84%
A cathedral had been built over
it, in effect to cover it up.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The Dominican
cathedral, the Dominicans,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
the ones who run the
inquisition still.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Then, in the 1950s,
an earthquake came,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.240 align:middle line:84%
pretty near destroyed
the cathedral.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
But the Inca temple
remained standing.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Intact.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Underneath-- and this is the
most important of Inca temples.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was the Inca temple that
marked the beginning of time.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:84%
From within this temple, all
of the calendar lines emerged.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was also the temple
where you could go back

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to the beginning
of time and where

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.190 align:middle line:84%
you could step outside of time,
outside of the grip of time

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a key idea,
because in Western theology,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.270 align:middle line:90%
we have this notion of--

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
at the end of time, there
will be a resurrection.

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.930 align:middle line:84%
>> People will meet their
maker at the end of time.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And the shamans seem
to feel that the end

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
of time or eternity outside
of time can be experienced.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, see, the shamanic
methodologies are designed

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:10%
to do that.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:10%
They'll say, of course you can
wait until the end of time.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:10%
It's a very long time to wait.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:10%
But how about tonight?

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:10%
What do you say tonight we
recover our original nature

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.700 align:middle line:10%
that is free from death, that
is able to taste infinity,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:10%
that is able to experience our
healed state that can never

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:10%
be affected by illness, by
disease, not even by death?

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Very powerful
methodologies that I think

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:90%
are eminently applicable today.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've been visiting
these cultures now for decades,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:84%
for approximately three. four
decades, and I've had many,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:90%
many such experiences.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You've written about them
articulately in numerous books.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say this,
because some of our viewers,

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
amongst the more
sophisticated viewers,

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.420 align:middle line:84%
there may be a
sense of cynicism.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We've heard of Carlos Castaneda
and other people who write

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:90%
about shamanistic traditions.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, later on, we learn
that what they've written

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.110 align:middle line:90%
was fictionalized.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And I know that you write
with more integrity than that.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
But before you answer, Alberto,
we need to take a short break.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Dr. Alberto
Villoldo about the path

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Inca medicine wheel.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And as we were saying
before the break,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.805 align:middle line:84%
there is amongst
academics, certainly, and--

00:11:25.805 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a lot of debate.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --the United States,
a lot of distrust.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, there is, because
this is an oral tradition,

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:10%
and it's based on direct
experience and personal

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:34.970 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:10%
It's a very poetic tradition
too, which lends itself

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:10%
to a lot of misinterpretation,
and making very exotic claims,

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:10%
as you have with some
of the popular writers.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
it's a very rich path

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that invites the traveler
to experience communion

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
with the Earth,
with the heavens,

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:84%
with the forces of
nature directly, and then

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.320 align:middle line:90%
draw your own conclusions.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:90%
But this is the path of poetry.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not the path of
dissection, of seeing

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.330 align:middle line:84%
what lies inside the frog,
but how sweetly can it sing.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a wonderful complement
to our Western scientific path.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we're best
prepared to experience this

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
through a Western
training so we don't

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
slip into the grips of
popular superstition.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, our popular
superstition in the West

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:84%
is science, which has become
a theology in the West.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But you find the same concepts
in the shamanic cultures,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.580 align:middle line:84%
because they were very
wise observers of nature.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And they noticed
that, for example,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:84%
the laws of physics, the same
ways that we've identified,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
have been identified by these
extraordinary architects

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:90%
and medicine people.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.290 align:middle line:84%
But they described
them animistically.

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:84%
We have the second
law of thermodynamics,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:84%
the law of entropy,
which is the law that

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
says that everything in
the physical universe

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.142 align:middle line:90%
tends to chaos.

00:13:05.142 --> 00:13:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't need to be a
rocket scientist to know that.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
That's why we carry day
planners, basically.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman describe
this force as Jaguar.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.300 align:middle line:90%
They call the Jaguar.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But then they
discovered that biology

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
followed a different path.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:90%
Biology did not tend to chaos.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It tended to
complexity, into beauty.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And you have cells that
team up with each other

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
to become tissues, that become
organs, that become eagles.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So they called that
jaguar as well.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:10%
So the shaman is able to go
mother sister jaguar, come

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:10%
to me.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Teach me your ways.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And that organizing principle
of the universe, of jaguar,

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.320 align:middle line:90%
will respond.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Whereas we can't go,
entropy, come to me,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:90%
because we have a non--

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> We think nature is dead.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:90%
It is, yes.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:58.900 align:middle line:90%
The spirit has left nature.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We talk about our
father who is not here

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
instead of the great spirit
that permeates all things.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
dealing, for example,

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
with a runaway cancer
that is chaos spreading

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.340 align:middle line:84%
through the body,
you're able to call

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.040 align:middle line:84%
on this organizing principle
to bring harmony out of chaos.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you're looking at the
renewal of a marriage

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
or the renewal of
a city that needs

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect with this
organizing principle of nature

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that's available to us all,
except we are still convinced

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
that we live on the other
side of the wall of the garden

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.040 align:middle line:90%
of Eden.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what you had to do
when you went through many

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
initiations, one of them
was to let go of your past.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, all of it at once.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's the medicine way.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.610 align:middle line:84%
You shed the past
the way the serpent

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:84%
sheds her skin, which means
that it no longer informs you.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It no longer
hijacks the present,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because the Western notion,
one of the problems with it

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.350 align:middle line:84%
is that it breeds
psychotherapists.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it says
who we are today

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is a result of who
we were when we

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
were 10 and this violent
trauma that happened to us.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.830 align:middle line:84%
But who we are today can also be
informed by who we're becoming,

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:90%
not only by who we have been.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with
stepping outside of time.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
You can only access
that which you

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:84%
are becoming by stepping
out of linear time

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:84%
and shedding the
past all at once.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Rather than
rehashing the past.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Rather than the tremendous
suffering that we experience

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
in the West, because that's
what the Buddha taught us,

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
of course, is that we
all experience pain,

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:39.820 align:middle line:90%
but suffering is a choice.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Suffering is dwelling
on what happened

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
and dwelling on how terrible it
might be when it happens again.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
So you shed it all at
once as an act of love

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
and an act of power.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And you engage the Earth in
your own healing processes,

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.390 align:middle line:84%
engage the mother
that has never left us

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:84%
and that will never leave
us, and the mother that

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
wants us to be well.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Engage her and have her
assist us in our own healing.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And this has been
done through ritual.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been done through a
set of practices and techniques

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that have been remembered and
transmitted through ritual.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Ritual has become the
vehicle for transmitting

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:90%
this information.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.990 align:middle line:90%
This has become the vehicle.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:27.700 align:middle line:10%
But when you strip the ritual
of its cultural frills,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:10%
what you have is a methodology
of human transformation

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:10%
based on the recognition
of a luminous envelope that

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:10%
surrounds the physical body.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now let's talk
about that some more.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.350 align:middle line:84%
When you first understood that
Antonio Morales, your teacher,

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.780 align:middle line:84%
was a great shaman
was at the occasion

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:51.740 align:middle line:84%
in which he was ministering
to the death of a missionary,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:52.540 align:middle line:90%
as I recall.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:84%
In an Indian village
high in the Andes.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
A missionary had died.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:90%
She was very jaundiced.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
first time that I

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.329 align:middle line:84%
saw he was not only the
professor but the medicine man

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:90%
that I had been looking for.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:10%
And what he did is
that he assisted her

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:14.260 align:middle line:10%
in separating her luminous
body from her physical one,

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:10%
and in handing her
over like a mother

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.530 align:middle line:10%
hands a baby over
to a grandmother,

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:10%
turning her over
to the spirit world

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:10%
so that she could make her
journey back home consciously.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:10%
But I saw this.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:10%
He awakened my
seeing, my sensing.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And I was able to perceive
this luminous form

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:10%
departing the physical.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:10%
And the place changed from
an Indian hut with mud floors

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:10%
into a cathedral.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.318 align:middle line:84%
The feel of the place became
the feel of a cathedral.

00:17:46.318 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Something sacred
was taking place.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a sacredness.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:90%
There were angels in this room.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
She was making her
journey back home, back

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to her spiritual home,
back to our spiritual home.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And you were seeing something
luminous with your physical

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:90%
eyes?

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:84%
I was sensing them
with my entire body.

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
But the images were
being created, of course,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.950 align:middle line:84%
in the same part
of the brain that

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
creates images for the
physical eye, which

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.755 align:middle line:90%
is in the visual cortex--

00:18:12.755 --> 00:18:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> This is very key--

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.455 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the back of the brain.

00:18:14.455 --> 00:18:16.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --to understanding
this phenomenology.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, because you know seeing
doesn't happen out there.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A camera would not probably
have been able to photograph

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.582 align:middle line:90%
what you experienced.

00:18:25.582 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course not, because
it's not within the visible

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:90%
spectrum.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:10%
>> But in the presence of
Antonio Morales and another--

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:10%
in the presence of other
shamans with whom you worked,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.000 align:middle line:10%
this visionary capacity
seemed to be more accessible.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.285 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, it's awakened,
because they hold a field,

00:18:43.285 --> 00:18:46.885 align:middle line:10%
a space in which my notions of
what is real and what is not

00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:49.060 align:middle line:10%
are not as viable.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:10%
They are peeled away.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:10%
And also, within this
field, they were--

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.620 align:middle line:10%
I was able to have
multi-modal perception,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:10%
multi-sensory perception.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I was able to taste,
smell, see, hear spirit.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
have references

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
to this throughout
the Western literature

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:90%
and mystical literature.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
If you read St. Teresa,
St. John of the Cross,

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.770 align:middle line:84%
if you speak to the
Tibetans, there's

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:84%
constant references
to this light

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that we confuse in the
West for an internal state.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
We think that enlightenment
is only something that

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
happens inside your brain,
that when Christ said,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I am the way to the
light and that I

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
am the light, that
he was referring

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:90%
to some kind of metaphor.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And when the Buddhists speak
about the way of enlightenment,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that that's just a
metaphor for something

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:90%
that happens internally.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.025 align:middle line:84%
Of course, that's our
Western translation.

00:19:47.025 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But throughout the primary
cultures of the world,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
this is a literal
experience of the light

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.240 align:middle line:90%
that continues beyond death.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, many people might think,
after having been awakened like

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:90%
this, that you had arrived.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But for you, it wasn't
an arrival at all.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.780 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
beginning of what became

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:90%
a very lengthy course of study.

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It shattered my
conceptions of reality.

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I had a fresh
doctorate under my arm.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that I--

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Knew something.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> --knew something.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And it deconstructed
my worldview,

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
including my notions
of time and space.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Then I had to begin-- that's
when I began my training.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I recognized that my doctoral
work had been a prelude to,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and that this was the real work,
the work that I could truly

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.490 align:middle line:90%
make a contribution with.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that one of
the greatest contributions

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of the shamans'
body of knowledge

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.940 align:middle line:84%
is the journey beyond death,
the death rights where

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:54.010 align:middle line:84%
we can assist a loved one in
making this journey back home

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:84%
so that we're not
lost and we're not

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
caught in the space between
the worlds in the nightmare

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:90%
that we can't wake up from.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you begin your book,
"Dance of the Four Winds,"

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:84%
which you wrote back in
about 1990 as I recall,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
describing how you were drawn
to go to Peru to take drug

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.340 align:middle line:84%
ayahuasca because it was known
to be a drug that brought one

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.860 align:middle line:90%
to the experience of death.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:10%
Correct.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.480 align:middle line:10%
And it does, of course,
and it did with me.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:10%
And I found out
that it was not only

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:10%
a drug that did it, that it was
really your purity of intent

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:10%
and your love that allowed
you to travel beyond death.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:10%
The drug just put it right
in your face, which is--

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:10%
and it's absolutely
unnecessary for this journey.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of
the core experiences

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:84%
of the shaman in
her training, is

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to master the ways beyond
death, now while we still

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:90%
have a body to come back to.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Because when our final journey
comes at the end of our lives,

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
that's not a good time to
be asking for directions.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems as if so much
of Western culture is motivated

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:90%
by the fear of death.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And what the shaman has is
an experience of infinity,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
experience of infinity, of a
self that cannot be subject

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to death.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And that realization is
the most healing experience

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that we can have, to know that
we're free of the grip of time,

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
of the grip of death,
and the grip of disease.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is fundamental to
the understanding of the path

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Inca medicine wheel.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And Alberto, I want to thank
you for sharing it with us.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:84%
You've covered in this short
interview so many things,

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.875 align:middle line:84%
from the anthropological
perspective--

00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I cover 20
years of my training.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.380 align:middle line:84%
But this is my intent now,
is to bring it to the West,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
to take the shamanic out of
the rattle shaking and feather

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.080 align:middle line:90%
waving and into the practical.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Alberto Villoldo, thank
you so much for being with me.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeff.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a pleasure.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being with us.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:90%
