>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
the religious significance

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
of entheogenic
plants and chemicals.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
With me is Professor Huston
Smith, one of the world's

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
great authorities on religion.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.170 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of
"The World's Religions,"

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
as well as "The
Forgotten Truth,"

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
"Beyond the Postmodern
Mind," and "Cleansing

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:90%

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
He is an Emeritus Professor
in Philosophy and Religion

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
from MIT, Syracuse,
and Berkeley.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Huston.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very good
to be here, Jeffrey.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Let's define this very
interesting term, entheogenic.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:10%
>> The etymology
is god-containing--

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:10%
"theos" is god-- but it
would be a little more

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:10%
accurate to say god-disclosing.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And the popular word in the
1960s was the psychedelics,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
but that decade caused
those substances

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
to careen off in
a very crazy way.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the people who are
seriously interested are

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:84%
interested in chemical changes
in the brain for serious

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
reasons, specifically
for mystical disclosures,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.650 align:middle line:84%
intentionally want to dissociate
these substances from the crazy

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic '60s, and
so they have adopted--

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.100 align:middle line:84%
and the tendency is
going in their direction

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
now to refer to
them as entheogens.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Entheogens.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not an easy
word, I have to--

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> God-disclosing.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's the--

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --meaning.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The original meaning
of psychedelic I think was

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:90%
something like mind manifesting.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and that's all right.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Innocuous.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
If it had not picked up
that crazy cultural baggage

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.400 align:middle line:90%
that that decade loaded it with.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And some other terms that
have been used over the years

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.040 align:middle line:90%
would include hallucinogenic.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That I stubbornly refuse to
use because that has the word--

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the connotation of deception.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a hallucination is
something that we think we see,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:90%
but it's not there.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so that has a pejorative
built into the word,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that definitely
should be red penciled.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Well-- and even
worse, I think, I've

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
heard the term
psychomimetic, suggesting

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
that these substances mimic
the effects of psychosis.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that also--

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
our culture with the
hysteria over the drug war

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
is so mixed up on this issue,
which was one of the reasons

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that I decided to
risk taking it on,

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to try to introduce some
sober sanity into our thinking

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
in this area.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well one of the
points that you make,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
if I understand your
thinking correctly--

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and you've been writing and
thinking about these substances

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.100 align:middle line:90%
for about 40 years--

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the experience
that one has

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.850 align:middle line:84%
can vary widely depending
upon what the person brings

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.960 align:middle line:90%
to the experience.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:84%
If there's one thing
that is undisputed

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.380 align:middle line:84%
in this very
controversial area, it

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
is that there is no such thing
as the or a drug experience.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the chemical
effects on the brain

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360 align:middle line:90%
are always filtered through--

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the technical words
are set and setting.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Set is the psychological
makeup of the ingester,

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and setting is the social
situation in which it is taken.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:10%
And those always enter in--

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:10%
which makes the whole
phenomena complex,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:10%
but we always have to
introduce those two things

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:10%
when talking about experience.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you yourself were exposed
to these entheogens at a time

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:84%
when you had already made a
pretty solid life commitment

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
to the study of
religion and philosophy.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.730 align:middle line:90%
You were a professor at MIT.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.790 align:middle line:90%
That's a fair statement.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I had given 20 years to
exploring world religion--

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:84%
at that time, most
concertedly to Hinduism,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
a decade in the Vedanta
under the tutelage

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.450 align:middle line:84%
of a very able teacher, and then
with Daiset Suzuki in Buddhism,

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:90%
10 years in Buddhism.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And through them,
I became convinced

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of the truth of the
mystical vision of reality.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.450 align:middle line:84%
But even my 20
years of meditation

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.870 align:middle line:84%
had not taken me very
far towards actually

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:90%
experiencing that reality.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And so when Aldous
Huxley's book,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
"The Doors of
Perception," appeared,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well,
there may be hope even

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:84%
for a flat-footed mystical
Huston in this lifetime.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I might need a little
boost, and this might do it.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And you had the
opportunity to participate

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:84%
in research sponsored
by Harvard University

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and funded, I believe,
by the US government

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to explore the uses
of these substances

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
in a therapeutic context.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure about the
resources of the government.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Harvard had sufficient
resources for the project,

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
but it is true, I
was very fortunate.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I had in my encounter
with these substances

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
when they were not only legal,
but they were respectable.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.570 align:middle line:84%
My ingestions were a part
of the Harvard experiment.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, I thought that
this part, important, though,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
those years were and
those experiences were,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought this was sort
of 30 years in the past.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But there is a new breed
of people who have--

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.690 align:middle line:84%
young people who have
won my respect, who

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:84%
are trying to carve out
in this crazy situation

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.550 align:middle line:84%
on this subject, trying
to carve out a space

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:53.810 align:middle line:84%
where serious students can
responsibly and legally have

00:08:53.810 --> 00:09:00.890 align:middle line:84%
this experience, which
just let me just insert--

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley, one of the great
intellects of our century,

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:14.850 align:middle line:84%
said is beyond any question
the most significant experience

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.600 align:middle line:84%
a human being can have short
of the beatific vision.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Now to come back, these
young people are trying--

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're working very
closely with drug officials

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
in Washington, they will do
nothing illegal, and they--

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:43.490 align:middle line:84%
it is they who came to me and
said, we've been tracking you.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:84%
These people are whizzes
on internet and websites,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.470 align:middle line:84%
and we discovered
that over the years,

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
you have written eight essays
on this subject, various aspects

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.700 align:middle line:10%
We've scanned
them, and they even

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:10%
handed me a bound
book already and said,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.930 align:middle line:10%
we think these
essays would help us

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:10%
in our cause to try to
introduce some sanity here.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:10%
May we bring them out in a book?

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.500 align:middle line:10%
It had never occurred to me when
I first heard the possibility,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:10%
I think I winced a
little because I can just

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:10%
see what little
reputation I had built up

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:10%
and my 40-year career
just being smashed

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:10%
by virtue of entering into
such a controversial subject.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:49.530 align:middle line:10%
But in the end, I agreed,
because I had the experience--

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:10%
and I'm very
grateful that I and--

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.840 align:middle line:10%
this is in keeping with
William James, who,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.660 align:middle line:10%
under nitrous oxide, has had
experiences and needs said,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:10%
he could not close
his books on reality

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:10%
without taking
them into account.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So if it could help
the next generation

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
to have responsible
experiences of this kind,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to do what I could.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Huston, we'll
take a short break.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:10%
My guest is s Huston Smith, one
of the world's great scholars

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:10%
of religion, and
we are discussing

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:10%
the religious significance
of entheogenic plants

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:10%
and chemicals, chemicals
that help to bring

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:10%
about the experience of God.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And let's talk about
that experience, Huston.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.920 align:middle line:10%
You-- actually, one of
the essays that you wrote

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:10%
describes your early
experiences, and as I recall,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:10%
you describe it as an empirical
approach to metaphysics,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:10%
the realities that are described
in the mystical literature

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:10%
of the world and the mystical
philosophy of the world

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:10%
became tangible to you.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.570 align:middle line:84%
I think they became
what William James would

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:90%
call a direct experience.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.520 align:middle line:90%
That is true.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:84%
I was a subject in
the Harvard project,

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and one of the conditions
of being a subject

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
would be that the day
after, one would write up

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.430 align:middle line:90%
an account of one's experiences.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And I had already
become convinced

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical
view of the world,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but I hadn't gotten very
far in experiencing it.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.550 align:middle line:90%
And so that is what happened.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It is a view of mounting
through higher and higher realms

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:84%
of reality towards the
clear light of the void.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And I can read about
it, and I believed it,

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.840 align:middle line:84%
but I had never, as you
say, experienced it,

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and you're quite right
in your reference.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:84%
There was one point in
which I even found myself

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
laughing at the scholars who had
credited the mystics as beings

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to pin the speculative
thinkers building

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:84%
this incredible
view of the world,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and I laughed because I thought,
if they had some of this stuff,

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:84%
why, they would have only had
to have been hack reporters just

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
setting down what they saw
with their eye of the heart

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.940 align:middle line:90%
or the eye of the soul.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now my question
would be this.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.180 align:middle line:10%
Since you had studied
these mystical teachings

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.100 align:middle line:10%
and had become a professional
philosopher specializing

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:10%
in these teachings,
is it possible

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:10%
that what you were, in
effect, experiencing directly

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:10%
was the edifice of your own
thoughts on the subject?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I-- earlier we were
referred to set and setting,

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
set being the makeup of the
ingester, and I have no doubt--

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I would suspect that
that's true with everyone.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And so one has this
experience through the lens

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
of one's own personality,
including one's belief.

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
So the match was so
perfect between what

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I believed with my mind and what
I was now seeing, that I'm sure

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%
that there was that--

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:90%
what should I say, screen?

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But that, of course,
in my mind does not

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.850 align:middle line:84%
challenge at all the
validity because I

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.420 align:middle line:84%
believe that's the
way things are anyway

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:90%
whether we see them or not.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I understand
you correctly,

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.310 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is that
yes, there was that level

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
of your mental structure,
but beyond that,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
there's an ontological reality,
something real that your mind

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:90%
was touching.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I believe that's true.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Philosophically one would call
me a metaphysical realist.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that what
we're thinking about

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.240 align:middle line:84%
is out there whether
we're here or not,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and we are trying
to understand it.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very much opposed
to the constructivist view

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:90%
that we make our own reality.

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We influence how we
experience the world,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:26.550 align:middle line:84%
but that stone is there
for us to stumble over

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.010 align:middle line:90%
whether we see it or not.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mention that a
big part of your preparation

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.960 align:middle line:84%
as a scholar in the field
of religion was the study

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.220 align:middle line:90%
of Vedanta.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And in Vedanta--

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That was the first that laid
down the foundation for about

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:90%
10 years studying in that.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> When one studies the Vedas,
the ancient religious writings

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
of India, one cannot avoid
the repeated ecstatic mention

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:90%
of a substance called Soma.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> These scholars, indologists
all agree that of the 10 books

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.270 align:middle line:84%
so that the Rigveda, the
foundations of Hinduism,

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:84%
the 10th book is devoted
entirely to hymns to this god

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
Soma, and indologists agree
that there is a fervor,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
there is a passion, there is
a kind of ecstasy that runs

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
through that book relating
to that god that exceeds that

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:90%
of the other nine volumes.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's understood
that Soma, although a God--

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and I presume that the sanskrit
word is the same word that we

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:90%
use when we talk about soma--

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:90%
the body, it's a substance.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.130 align:middle line:90%
It was something they ingested.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I think the hymns are
very clear about how

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:90%
they prepared it and--

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It made its abode
in the soma plant

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
in exactly the way in which
American Indians and South

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
America will refer to the
mushrooms as God's flesh.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So yes, that was its
dwelling on Earth.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're not talking now
about a shamanistic culture,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about one of
the world's great religions.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:10%
That's a fair statement.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.230 align:middle line:10%
>> But of course, I don't
mean to denigrate shamanism,

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:10%
because one would find around
the world, if I'm correct,

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:10%
Huston, in Africa and in South
America and in the islands

00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:00.230 align:middle line:10%
and in Siberia that the
original impulse for spiritual

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:10%
experience as manifested
through shamanism was always

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.080 align:middle line:10%
intertwined with various vines
and plants and what we could

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:10%
call entheogens.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:16.100 align:middle line:10%
>> And in Mesoamerica
today, very definitely.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:10%
>> We have the Native
American Church.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.780 align:middle line:10%
Stemming out of that foundation.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:10%
>> In which the substance--
the peyote cactus, which--

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:34.040 align:middle line:10%
>> --is a entheogenic substance
is considered a sacrament.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't need
to go into it,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:84%
but I spent two years working
with a Native American church

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:90%
when the Supreme Court in 1990--

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:57.710 align:middle line:84%
if you'll excuse me, I think is
the most perfidious ruling they

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:84%
ever handed down, stripped
the Native American Church

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.930 align:middle line:84%
of its constitutional
religious right

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.295 align:middle line:90%
because its sacrament is peyote.

00:20:10.295 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Now peyote you cannot get
addicted to, and not a single

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.700 align:middle line:84%
misdemeanor has ever been
traced to that substance,

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
but because that's
their sacrament.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Now whereas alcohol, when
we compare the difference,

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
70% of the cases that turn up in
emergency room in hospitals are

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:90%
alcohol-related, but when--

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because that's our sacrament,
the dominant religion

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.760 align:middle line:84%
of the world, that's all
right, but this is theirs,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and so that's not--

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:59.540 align:middle line:84%
the injustice of that
situation, but we

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.810 align:middle line:84%
weren't going to
talk about politics.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The point that you seem
to be stressing, though,

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:11.210 align:middle line:84%
from your researches is that
the Native Americans who ingest

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:84%
peyote in a religious context
are engaging in authentic

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.350 align:middle line:84%
spiritual practice
and experience.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:10%
In the course of those
four years, why--

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:10%
two years, by the way, two
of the most rewarding years

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:33.010 align:middle line:10%
of my work, I had four all-night
vigils in the teepee with them.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:10%
And nowhere in
any tradition have

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:10%
I felt more spiritual
sincerity and intensity

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:10%
than in those
teepees that night.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:52.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a chapter in
my book devoted entirely

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:90%
to that subject.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.860 align:middle line:84%
So at the same time,
you're quite critical.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:84%
You have been critical
of the popular culture,

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:90%
the psychedelic--

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.890 align:middle line:84%
sort of the abuse of these
substances into something

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:90%
more casual.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
It is a very murky
social situation.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And the attempt to isolate
entheogenic substances, which

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm tempted to say
have no danger--

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
now that-- point,
point, point, point,

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:42.580 align:middle line:84%
not quite right, but
almost so to isolate

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that form popular recreational
use is a very difficult thing.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Huston, thank you so much,
it's been a pleasure sharing

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.840 align:middle line:90%
this time with you.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.750 align:middle line:90%
>> I've enjoyed it also.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.730 align:middle line:84%
