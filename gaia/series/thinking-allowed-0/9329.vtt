conversations on the leading

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.470 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Today, we will be
exploring once again

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
the enormous social
and personal changes

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:90%
through which we are evolving.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Jean Houston,
author of numerous books,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
including "A Passion for the
Possible," "The Passion of Isis

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
and Osiris," "The
Possible Human," "Search

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
for the Beloved," "The Hero and
the Goddess," and "Jump Time."

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Jean is the director of the
Foundation for Mind Research.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And she is also a worldwide
educator and founder

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Mystery School.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, jean.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeff.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in religious
traditions it's sometimes said

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
that there's a new age, an age
of Aquarius, or a new yuga.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:84%
One might even think,
and I tend to think,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
that something is
happening now, perhaps

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.410 align:middle line:84%
even comparable to the evolution
of the first single-celled

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
creature when you consider
what we're doing to the planet,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:84%
linking it together
electronically.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the planet is
becoming a global organism.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
The changes through which
we are going are so vast,

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.450 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to have
a handle on it.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.133 align:middle line:84%
You might compare it
to the Renaissance.

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.050 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's much,
much, bigger than that.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Much larger.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We're being rescaled to
planetary proportions.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's been
prophetic things about it.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
One thinks of the
movie "2001" when

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:84%
you had that cosmic fetus know
wrapped in a luminous placenta

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.580 align:middle line:90%
overlooking the Earth.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And that reminds me of the
time when we came back,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.030 align:middle line:84%
we came back as the
partners of the Earth.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.363 align:middle line:90%
>> After the first spaceflights.

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:13.697 align:middle line:90%
>> After the first spaceflights.

00:02:13.697 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:90%
So that's very different.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
That whole sense of
new age, you know,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:84%
that's a term that has
been used many times.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:90%
You find in the Book of Daniel.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
You can certainly find it in
Hegel, and Marx, and Lessing.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.740 align:middle line:84%
It's on the dollar bill, the
new order, novus ordo seclorum.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:90%
But I think this is truly it.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean other, times in
history thought they were it.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:90%
They were wrong.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:90%
This is it.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a sense, I think,
from the Mayan predictions,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.010 align:middle line:90%
that time will end.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That time will end or history
will come to an end as we have

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
known it.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether that's
true or not--

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:90%
in a sense, it's true.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's not accurate.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to being
accurate but not true.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what is going on

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:84%
is that there are so many
radical things happening

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
that, as I said, today does
not look like tomorrow at all.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And the acceleration of time
and space, the acceleration

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:90%
of things in our lives--

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.010 align:middle line:84%
if I were to say to you,
compared to when you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and I first met 30 years ago--

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and I remember you as
leaping from balconies

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and swinging on beams.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You were a monkey man
in your early 20s.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:90%
And you still are.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You still are
swinging from beams.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.310 align:middle line:84%
But they're beams of
thought, aren't they?

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:90%
They're beams of possibility.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:90%
But how would you--

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
we met probably somewhere
in the early '70s.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> In the early '70s, yes.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.600 align:middle line:84%
>> How would you compare what
you see in your life now?

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There were concepts
then that I was exploring.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I was very
interested, for example,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.650 align:middle line:90%
in UFOs.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:90%
But other people were not.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard to
discuss it with people.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's as if the whole
culture is preparing itself

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.830 align:middle line:84%
for things that you
couldn't discuss back then.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> As if we are in preparation.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.650 align:middle line:84%
We're in a giant womb, a kind
of gestation chamber for a world

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
that we used to just see as
a kind of myth or a science

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:90%
fiction.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And we are beginning the first
bird-like, crack, crack, crack,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.329 align:middle line:84%
crack cracks to come
out of this place

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
that we've been in preparation.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And what it will be will
probably be way beyond anything

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:90%
that we have even conceived of.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, children
are different.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We talk about these children who
seem strangely prescient, seem

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to be very knowing.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.173 align:middle line:90%
Elders are different.

00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Elders-- let me
tell you something

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that I've never really
spoken about before.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.935 align:middle line:84%
Some years ago, as you
know, I had a terrible time.

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
I found myself on the front
page of every newspaper

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I remember that.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It was awful, for
something that never happened.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I know how wounded you felt.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.623 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was awful.

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Because I had just helped
Hillary Clinton write a book.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And they said that I'd been
doing seances in the White

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.415 align:middle line:90%
House, which I had not.

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I merely helped the
poor woman write a book.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.703 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you had
been doing seances,

00:05:04.703 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:90%
it would have been OK by me.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It would have been OK by you.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what happened.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.225 align:middle line:84%
I've never even
been to a seance.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.860 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, I felt very wounded.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:90%
So I said, look, I'm wounded.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm vulnerable.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm available.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:90%
So I went out.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And I began to work
with AIDS babies,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:90%
healing, working with them.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And I began to work with
people with Alzheimer's.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
My uncle was dying, in the
last stages of Alzheimer's.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So I was visiting him
in a nursing home.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to
see what I could do.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.970 align:middle line:84%
And I said, look, how could
I be with these people?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I know something
else is going on.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So I began to visit
nursing homes--

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I still do-- and talk to
elderly people who had what was

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:90%
described as Alzheimer's.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And I would take
them by the hands.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And say it was some fellow
who'd been born in 1908.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'd begin to
sing to them songs

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that I thought they heard
as babies, (SINGING)

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.475 align:middle line:84%
hushabye, don't you cry, go
to sleep you little baby.

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:01.340 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) Then I'd
go up to around 1911.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And it would be something
like, oh, you know,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.925 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) London bridge is
falling down, falling down.

00:06:08.925 --> 00:06:14.735 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) The 1912,
1913, a song from then,

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) every little movement
has a meaning all on its own.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) 1917,
(SINGING) I wish I

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.210 align:middle line:84%
could shimmy like
my sister Kate.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:90%
Nursing is my vocation.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:84%
France is my destination.
(SPEAKING) 1924, (SINGING)

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Charleston, Charleston,
[HUMMING].. (SPEAKING) 1931,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING) you are
the promised princess.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And I would go on year by year.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, somewhere around
the 1940s, (SINGING)

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
I got my heart, I
love it, (SPEAKING)

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.580 align:middle line:90%
they'd start to sing with me.

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.725 align:middle line:90%
And then we'd be singing.

00:06:47.725 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We'd be singing
through the '40s.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We'd sing through the
'50s, "Unchained Melody."

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And then, at a certain
point, I realized

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:84%
from a change in their eyes
that we could communicate.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Because we had communicated at
a different bandwidth, music.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And often, they would start to,
either a sing a song, or even

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.070 align:middle line:84%
in words, tell me
about where they were.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And they would tell me
about adventures so strange,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and mythic landscapes
that they were visiting.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> While they're
experiencing Alzheimer's?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, as if there was another
world that they were very alive

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.563 align:middle line:90%
and very feisty in.

00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And some of them could
even make a distinction

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
between the world here,
which had receded,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and the world there,
which had opened up.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And I knew, as Rumi had
said, the great Sufi poet,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that for every garden
we see without,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.153 align:middle line:90%
there are 70,000 gardens within.

00:07:44.153 --> 00:07:46.445 align:middle line:84%
And I've taught a lot of
nurses-- not too many doctors,

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:48.260 align:middle line:84%
truth be told, but
a lot of nurses

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.160 align:middle line:84%
how you know how to begin
by essentially changing

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.190 align:middle line:84%
the valence, changing
the perspective to a very

00:07:55.190 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
different form of contact, and
also appreciating and honoring

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.750 align:middle line:84%
that more was going on
there than pathology.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.053 align:middle line:90%
The pathology was the surface.

00:08:04.053 --> 00:08:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The mythic structures that
were going on were much better.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.768 align:middle line:84%
>> You have never seen a
wall that you didn't know

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.310 align:middle line:84%
there's a window or
a door somewhere.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.185 align:middle line:90%
>> There's something.

00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Or you creep in underneath,
or down the chimney.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> There's always a
way to get through.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So I found that the great
gift to me of being vulnerable,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
that vulnerable
and that wounded,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
because in our woundings are
openings to other places,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we become deeply
available to other people,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.090 align:middle line:84%
and then can call forth,
beyond their wounding,

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.090 align:middle line:90%
the treasures that are there.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, our world
is a wounded world.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We're living in an era right
now where more species are

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:90%
going extinct--

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Every 25 minutes.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the age of the
dinosaur extinction,

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.735 align:middle line:90%
we haven't seen this.

00:08:47.735 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, this huge cut back.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet, something
else is going on.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the cultures and
the psyche are blooming.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.940 align:middle line:84%
We talked in a
previous interview

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.240 align:middle line:84%
which we had together
about how part of my work

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
has been to help
cultures deepen.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.440 align:middle line:84%
In the words of T.S.
Eliot, redeem the time,

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.100 align:middle line:84%
redeem the unread vision
of the higher dream.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder that with a high
individuation, the reculturing

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
of cultures, and the
growth of new cultures

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that's occurring,
whether the Earth

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
herself is redeeming
some of the species lost

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
through the birth of culture
and the redemption of culture.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.452 align:middle line:84%
But it is true that
in the next 20 years,

00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
there are some
radical things we're

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.577 align:middle line:84%
going to have to do
on the outward world

00:09:33.577 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
with parallels in
the inward world.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to use nanotechnology

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
to reconstitute our atmosphere.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to go
into the archives of genotypes

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and genetics and
bring back species.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.530 align:middle line:84%
But we have the
power to do that.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But we will not have
the power to do it

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.550 align:middle line:84%
if we do not have another
consciousness that

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:54.350 align:middle line:90%
will agree to it.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.683 align:middle line:84%
Because as Einstein said, the
consciousness that created

00:09:56.683 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the problem cannot be the same
consciousness that solves that

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.710 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And technology isn't what's
going to solve our problems.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's wisdom.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's wisdom, wisdom
brought to that,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.420 align:middle line:84%
wisdom that sees a very
different notion of the idea

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.220 align:middle line:90%
of progress.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Einstein said that we must
learn to grow in wisdom as much

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:90%
as we have grown in power.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, no question.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.173 align:middle line:84%
>> And that is often your
role as a wisdom teacher.

00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't know.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.040 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of us out there.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thankfully.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And, you know, the beauty
of your show is that you bring

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:90%
them forward.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.438 align:middle line:90%
You bring them forward.

00:10:30.438 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Whereas they wouldn't show up
necessarily on some of these--

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Not on television, no.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --on the major media.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a privilege to do that.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the major media
is economically driven

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.500 align:middle line:84%
for entertainment, for what
will give a tang excitement,

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:90%
not for what will give a depth.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
programs like yours

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.920 align:middle line:90%
bring the depth perspective.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And so a sufficiency
of people I know--

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.737 align:middle line:84%
because I see people
everywhere around the world who

00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
see your programs.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.560 align:middle line:84%
They say, I woke up because
of something that I saw Jeff

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove's.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been important
for me to do that.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.540 align:middle line:90%
It's been a calling.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It came to me in dreams,
as a matter of fact.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, we can
talk about that, Jean.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:90%
But we need to take our break.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, all right.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.092 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll be back in
just a little bit.

00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:20.290 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the enormous
changes that are taking place

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.110 align:middle line:90%
now in our time.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And my guest is an
agent of change,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:35.260 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful psychologist and
mystery school teacher Jean

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Houston, author of "Jump Time."

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.095 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was asking
you before the break

00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to tell us about the
dream that you had that

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.715 align:middle line:90%
initiated this kind of program.

00:11:44.715 --> 00:11:46.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's very interesting.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
In 1973, Jean, right about
the time I first met you--

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
in '73, actually-- I
was a graduate student

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:90%
in criminology.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was studying every
form of social deviance,

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.980 align:middle line:84%
all the negative
sides of human nature.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:90%
And I knew I had to change.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to study the
positive side of human nature.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:84%
But frankly, at the University
of California where I was,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
you could study psychopathology
and crime, very many programs

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you wanted to study
creativity, intuition,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:84%
mysticism, psychic functioning,
there was no possibility.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I agonized over this
for many, many months.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.520 align:middle line:90%
And one day, I woke up.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said to myself,
tonight, I will have a dream.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I knew all day long that a dream
was going to come that night.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And so I prepared for it.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.780 align:middle line:84%
I drank a big glass
of water before I

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
went to bed so I could wake
up and write the dream down.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle
of the night, I

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:84%
dreamt that I was visiting
some friends in Berkeley.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
I ran across town.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm getting
ahead of myself.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
I went to their apartment,
knocked on the door.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.050 align:middle line:90%
There was no answer.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, I took
the key, let myself in.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of
the living room floor

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:84%
was a magazine
called "Eye," E-Y-E.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember very distinctly
reading this magazine

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:90%
in the dream.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And then I woke up.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like, oh, Eureka!

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:90%
I've found it!

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:90%
The answer is in the magazine!

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't know
what the answer was.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:90%
So I actually, then, I got up.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
I put on my tennis
shoes, ran across

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.330 align:middle line:84%
town, first thing
in the morning.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Got to the apartment.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Knocked on the door.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was there,
as I had dreamt.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.170 align:middle line:84%
So I did know where
they kept their key.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
I let myself in, walked
into the living room.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough, all by itself,
in the middle of the living

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:90%
room floor was one magazine.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It was called "Focus."

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And dream distortion, I guess,
it brought in focus to my life.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.350 align:middle line:90%
I began paging through it.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It was a magazine for
public television and radio

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:90%
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I paged through
it, I said to myself,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:05.140 align:middle line:84%
this is how I can pursue my
interest, by getting involved

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:90%
in listener-sponsored media.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And it never occurred
to me before.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
I didn't own a radio or
television at the time.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe that electronic
media was an authentic form

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:90%
of communication.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:90%
But I changed my mind.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And within three weeks, I was
working as a volunteer at KPFA

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.240 align:middle line:84%
in Berkeley, where I
first interviewed you

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.980 align:middle line:90%
shortly thereafter.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And I started as a receptionist,
just answering the phone.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But within a few weeks,
they gave me my own program.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.857 align:middle line:90%
And it changed my life.

00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It changed the life
of many other people.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been doing
this work ever since.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've always felt that there
was something from the dream

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:90%
world bringing this out in me.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The dream time that according
to the Australian Aborigines,

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:54.370 align:middle line:84%
transcends all time and space
and holds patterns and ideas.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:84%
In the altered state,
you were able to receive

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
part of your intelligence--
part of your destiny.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
Have you had dreams recently?

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.067 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time, yeah.

00:15:04.067 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I know you do that.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.470 align:middle line:84%
But I'm saying that you
have leaking margins.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Those kinds of dreams, that
one has let was good for 30

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't have those
powerful dreams that often.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I have had dreams that called
me to study parapsychology.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is where
you gained access.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
You had the access code
to your own possibility

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that would help the
world's possibility.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I try
to encourage people to do

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
is to get together,
even in small groups,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.580 align:middle line:90%
and begin to dream together--

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I call them the
Asclepeion dreams.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:90%
You've been in a few of these--

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
so that we can begin to
commune at a different level

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness with what is
the larger journey, the larger

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
story, for each of
us and for the world.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.970 align:middle line:90%
It is there.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of it.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
And so many people get so stuck
they cannot see the next stage.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
They just feel trivialized
in their lives.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Because that's true.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.240 align:middle line:84%
They are trivialized
only on a certain level.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But at other levels, as in
the dream, as in meditation,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
as in creative states,
as in loving states,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
as in community, they're
not trivialized anymore.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:90%
They open up the spectrum.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And in that spectrum is the
story of what they can do next

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
and what they can
do to be co creators

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.020 align:middle line:84%
in this extraordinary world of
change that we call jump time.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is why,
to be honest, Jean,

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:84%
you have been an important
person to me for 30 years.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Because when I had
these experiences that

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:84%
meant everything to me, and
I went to other teachers

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and psychologists and asked
for a context, an explanation,

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
a wisdom about it, they
couldn't say anything.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why I became
a parapsychologist.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I figured I had to
become my own expert.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.750 align:middle line:84%
But you have always
been able to articulate

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
a sense of what's
going on at that level,

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
at the archetypal level.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, see, I think we contain
within us at least these three

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.220 align:middle line:84%
levels, our local life
that I call this-is-me,

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:84%
who I am in time, and space,
profession, and gender,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.250 align:middle line:90%
marriage, those details.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And beneath that
and larger than that

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is the archetypal
level, where I become

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
part of the collective
unconscious of the human race.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I become part of the
great mind field,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the trillion-gigabyte
disk of creation,

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the symbols, the
myths, the gods,

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
the great symbolic
figures, the larger,

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.730 align:middle line:90%
stories the larger juice.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And of course, beyond
that, it is the I-am.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It is being itself, the
God stuff that sustains it

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.390 align:middle line:90%
all, the source levels.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.660 align:middle line:84%
That we human beings do
have access to these things,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
but we live out of such a
little tiny framework of that.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, Madeleine L'Engle
wrote a wonderful book

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:90%
called "The Irrational Season."

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And in it, she has an image.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
She said, suppose
you were suddenly

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.120 align:middle line:84%
placed in the midst of
the most beautiful planet

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.560 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But you had one sense upward,
and that's all, sense of smell.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:01.500 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.540 align:middle line:84%
You go around [SNIFFING],,
awfully interesting.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.390 align:middle line:90%
You know, that's all you knew.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And then, suddenly, all
your senses, plus much,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:90%
much more opened up.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.390 align:middle line:90%
What would it be like?

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:90%
It would be paradise, you see.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying that
this is where we are.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
We operate as if we are in one
sense, of one limited modality.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But beyond us, beneath
us, within us, around us,

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
is this incredible sensory
orchestral splendor.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But it means becoming
present to it, being aware.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Stop, if you will,
100 times a day.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
Stop, go off of robot.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.590 align:middle line:90%
Go into presence.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.048 align:middle line:84%
This, of course,
what the Buddhists

00:18:39.048 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:90%
refer to as mindfulness.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And gradually,
the inner presence

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
opens up as the
outer presence does.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:90%
It feeds each other.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, you're no longer
living a posthumous existence,

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:90%
as Keith said.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Or you go off of
lackluster passivity

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:84%
into this dynamic,
rich, engaging,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
world that is the world in which
those three worlds, this-is-me,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.680 align:middle line:84%
the archetypal world,
the God world open up.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Meister Eckhart said,
speaking as God,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
he said, I became man for
you, if you do not become

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:90%
God for me, you do me wrong.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have a great gift
of articulating these things

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.620 align:middle line:84%
with the full authority of
world culture behind you.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's needed
so much in our time, where

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:84%
the priests of our
society sometimes

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.960 align:middle line:84%
come from either
a narrow religious

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:90%
or a narrow scientific place.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:34.850 align:middle line:84%
We need new priests,
new spokespeople who

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.683 align:middle line:90%
can blend these two visions.

00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:90%
And you do that beautifully.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think it's--

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
priestcraft as it is midwifery.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It's evoking the-- and it's
also being a generalist.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm a generalist as I have
to study constantly and try

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to bring in hitherto divided
and distinguished worlds.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But in the era of
information explosion,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
generalists are
especially what we need.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, then we should have
more generalists, shouldn't we?

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Should we go out
and promote that?

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.310 align:middle line:84%
But people who are generalists,
both in the vertical dimension,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the
horizontal dimension, who

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
can help people gain access
to the depths of riches

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.180 align:middle line:84%
within themselves and within
the great psychic continuum,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as in information about
how the muchness of this world.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You point out that the
depths are rising up now.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe that.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.990 align:middle line:90%
They may have always been there.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
our access to them

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:34.453 align:middle line:84%
is feistier and richer because
our need is so great I think

00:20:34.453 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the
reasons that you

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
have so many people
searching as never

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.910 align:middle line:84%
before in other
spiritual traditions

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to find the bread of
life, the water of spirit.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, Rumi says, you
know, a basket full of bread

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%
sits on your head.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And you go begging crusts from
door to door, up to your knees

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and living water.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
And you're dying of thirst.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, stupid person.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Look at it, you have
sold yourself cheaply.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:06.733 align:middle line:84%
And my great sense is to
say, let's just stop it.

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's stop and look at the
muchness of what you are,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and to give people concrete
examples of how they can think

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.843 align:middle line:84%
in different ways, how they
can work with the depths of who

00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:19.010 align:middle line:84%
they are and with who others
are, how they can begin

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
to problem solve,

with ongoing
teaching-learning communities.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:90%
No guru, no guru.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Guru, to me is, spelled
gee, you are you.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
No money involved,
wherever possible.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all my books
are written for people

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.420 align:middle line:90%
to find these.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And in my new book, "Jump
Time," which is just out--

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:90%
at least as of our talk here--

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I try to provide ways
and means of doing this,

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
and to understand the immense
change of which we are a part.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Jean Houston, you're
speaking to me as the authentic

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:84%
spokesperson of the
real mystery tradition,

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:84%
the awakening of humanity that
has been hidden in our culture

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:84%
for thousands of years,
and is coming forth now.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a great pleasure,
a joy, to be with you.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.755 align:middle line:90%
I feel so touched.

00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's lovely
being with you, Jeffrey.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you are one
of those people who

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:15.490 align:middle line:84%
holds the breath and the
depth of human possibility.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I feel privileged
to be in that position, Jean.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And let me say this for all
of my viewers, if I may.

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
People ask me many, many
times, who is the best

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:90%
person you've ever interviewed?

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed hundreds
and hundreds of people.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've always
said, beyond a doubt,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
there's one person who stands
head and shoulders above all

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:90%
of the others.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's you.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And I want to honor you and
acknowledge you for that.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks so much,
Jean, for being with me.

00:22:44.202 --> 00:22:45.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:22:45.118 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
