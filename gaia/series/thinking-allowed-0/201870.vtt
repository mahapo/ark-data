00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Our topic today is
Imagery and the Alphabet.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
With me is Dr.
Leonard Shlain, who

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:10%
is the head of laparoscopic
surgery at the California

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:10%
Pacific Medical Center
in San Francisco,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:10%
and also an associate
professor of surgery

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.240 align:middle line:10%
at the University of California
San Francisco Medical Center.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Shlain is also the
author of two books,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
"Art & Physics," and "The
Alphabet Versus the Goddess."

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Leonard.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Your exploration into the
role of the alphabet in human

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.370 align:middle line:84%
culture began at a time when
you were touring the Near East.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That is correct.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
That was part of a
archaeological tour

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:10%
that began first in Greece.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:10%
And we had as the good
fortune to have as our guide

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.520 align:middle line:10%
an extremely knowledgeable
University of Athens professor.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And everywhere we
went, she told us

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.765 align:middle line:10%
that the temple that we were
standing before, say, it

00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:10%
was dedicated to Apollo
or Zeus, had originally

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:10%
been consecrated to a goddess.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And then for unknown
reasons at a later date,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:90%
it was reconsecrated to a god.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we went to Knossos
and visited the great Minoan

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It was so striking that it
was so obvious from the murals

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
and from what we could
see that women status was

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:84%
very high in this
culture, and goddesses

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.680 align:middle line:90%
were an important part.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And the trip ended at
Ephesus, which she explained

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
was the largest shrine to a
woman in the Western world,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.243 align:middle line:84%
prior to it being closed
by the Christians in 391.

00:02:05.243 --> 00:02:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And while we were
digesting these facts,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.250 align:middle line:90%
she pointed out the hillside.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you
know, legend has it

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
that Mary, the mother of
Jesus, came here and died

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and was buried.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:84%
And she was buried on
that hillside over there.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And on this long bus
ride back to the airport

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.090 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking to
myself, it's clear

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that there's
overwhelming evidence

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
that there was a time in
the historical past when

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
virtually all
cultures worshipped

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:90%
an Earth goddess of some sort.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
time when they didn't.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was pondering
the question of why

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
did it happen that for 5,000
years emerging civilizations

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:90%
all seemed to worship a goddess.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And then for the
next 5,000 years

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
they started worshipping gods.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the last 3,000 years
the goddesses disappeared.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what event
in culture could

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.380 align:middle line:84%
have been so immense
and so pervasive as

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.560 align:middle line:90%
to change the sex of God.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And I concluded
that after looking

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.790 align:middle line:84%
at all the current theories,
probably the most popular one

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is that the horse was
domesticated in 4500 BC,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and then these cavalry
came riding out

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
of the steps of
Russia and conquered

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
all the goddess-loving
people and substituted

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
their virile sky
gods for the goddess.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:10%
But I thought that
didn't sound right,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:10%
because throughout
history whenever there's

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:10%
been a invasion and a conquest
by a less sophisticated people

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.042 align:middle line:10%
of a sophisticated people,
the values inevitably

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:49.250 align:middle line:10%
flow in the other direction--

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Such as the Romans
conquering the Greeks.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.603 align:middle line:10%
The Romans conquered the Greeks.

00:03:52.603 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:10%
The Mongols sacked
Islam, Baghdad, in 1348,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:10%
and Baghdad is still Islamic.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:10%
And now Islam is the religion
of outer Mongolia, I mean.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.560 align:middle line:10%
So it didn't seem to me that
something that happened so long

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:10%
ago could account for
this changeover that's

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:10%
gone on for about
1,000-- it took

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:10%
about 1,000 years to complete.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:10%
And it occurred to me
that the thing that

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:10%
happened about the same
time that this was occurring

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.070 align:middle line:10%
is that people were learning
how to read and write.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:10%
And we know that in a child,
that if you teach the child

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:10%
certain kinds of information,
then certain neuronal pathways

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.710 align:middle line:10%
are reinforced,
and other pathways

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:10%
will wither if they don't
learn certain other kinds

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:10%
of information.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.760 align:middle line:84%
So what would be the
effect on culture

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.340 align:middle line:84%
of learning a linear,
sequential, reductionist,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and abstract mode of perception,
which is what writing is?

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first forms
of writing were

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
cuneiform and hieroglyphics,
which were so complicated

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that probably not more
than 2% of the population

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.030 align:middle line:90%
learned how to read and write.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.910 align:middle line:10%
But then in between
these two countries

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:10%
of Egypt and
Mesopotamia, some group

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:10%
figured out an
extremely easy way

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:10%
to communicate in writing
called the alphabet.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.192 align:middle line:10%
And alphabets are so easy
to learn that four-year-olds

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:10%
can learn the alphabet.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:10%
Forrest Gump can
learn the alphabet.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.500 align:middle line:10%
And suddenly, you have
this communication tool

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.800 align:middle line:10%
that holds out the promise
of universal literacy,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:10%
and I maintain that
changed culture.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't the
content of the books

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:90%
that I'm concentrating on.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I maintain that the process
of becoming literate

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.172 align:middle line:90%
is world-changing.

00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a literate person has
a totally different worldview

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:90%
than a nonliterate person.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know, the sense
of this for me is that when one

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:10%
does look into the archaeology
and the prehistory of Europe

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and the Middle East, it's well
known and agreed by scholars

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:10%
that these were all
goddess cultures.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.920 align:middle line:84%
But when I grew up and
studied history in school

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.970 align:middle line:90%
it was never taught.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And I guess the reason is
that the goddess cultures are

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.640 align:middle line:84%
by and large considered
prehistorical, which in a sense

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.440 align:middle line:90%
proves your point.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Because history itself is
said to begin with writing.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, when you communicate--

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:90%
let me back up for a moment.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.590 align:middle line:84%
The basis for this idea
has to do with the fact

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
that we humans have a very
strange wiring in our brain.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is that all
vertebrates from fish

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
forward have a bilobe brain.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And each hemisphere
of this bilobe brain

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
pretty much does what
the other hemisphere

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.890 align:middle line:84%
does, except it's a mirror
image, except in humans.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Humans have something called
hemispheric lateralization,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.192 align:middle line:84%
where although the two lobes
of the brain look very similar,

00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
functionally different--

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Specialized.

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Very specialized.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So 90% of language centers
reside in the left hemisphere

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:90%
of right-handed people.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
And to prevent getting bogged
down in qualifiers here,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to talk about
right-handed people who

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:90%
are predominantly left-brained.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost as if all
of the temporal functions,

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
all of the functions
that precede in time,

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:84%
such as language, causality,
determinism, logic, reason--

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
all those things
are very linear,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and all the spatial
functions-- not all of them,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
but many of the
spatial functions

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:84%
reside in the right
hemisphere, so

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that recognizing faces,
seeing patterns, seeing

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
the holistic gestalt,
and seeing the parts

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.090 align:middle line:84%
to the whole and the
relationship to them

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:50.640 align:middle line:84%
is primarily a right
hemispheric function.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if the right
hemisphere processes

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
information that is holistic,
synthetic, concrete,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and simultaneous, and
the left hemisphere

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.400 align:middle line:84%
processes information
that's linear, sequential,

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.380 align:middle line:90%
reductionist, and abstract.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I were to
show you my watch

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.000 align:middle line:10%
and say, look at my watch,
you would see it instantly,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:10%
simultaneously, and--

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.930 align:middle line:10%
There's no verbalization
necessary to see my watch.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:10%
But I could go in the
other room and write

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:10%
a two-page description of my
watch, give it to you to read,

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:10%
and if I was a good writer,
you would reconstruct

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:10%
what my watch looked like.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
But now you did this
in a totally new way.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I maintain that
every man and woman

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
has a feminine side
and a masculine side

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
to their personality, to
their psyche, to their mind.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that the masculine
side of both men and women

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
is primarily their
left hemisphere.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And the feminine side
of both men and women

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
is primarily their
right hemisphere.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.060 align:middle line:10%
So what is the effect on culture
of introducing into culture

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:10%
a very powerful communication
tool that reinforces only one

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:10%
side?

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
When I speak to you as
I'm doing right now,

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I need both sides of my
lips, both vocal chords,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:90%
both sides of my tongue--

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.070 align:middle line:84%
in fact, if I've been to the
dentist and I've had novocaine,

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk very well.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.305 align:middle line:84%
So I need the cooperation
of both hemispheres.

00:09:27.305 --> 00:09:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> As do, I presume, the people
who are watching us right now.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And when you're listening
to me, your left hemisphere

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
is following what I'm saying
in a very linear fashion--

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Word after word.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But your right hemisphere
is checking me out.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.255 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're watching me.

00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:90%
You're looking at me.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.672 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing whether
I seem sincere,

00:09:42.672 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:90%
whether I-- how am I dressed?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
Do I have alcohol on my breath?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.150 align:middle line:10%
And there's a whole
bunch of nonverbal clues

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:10%
that go into the
decision of what

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying that are almost as
important as what I'm saying.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.790 align:middle line:10%
When you write, you
write with only one hand.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Up until the invention
of the typewriter,

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:10%
the dominant hand held the
stylus, the pen, the chisel.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:10%
And the left hand
was essentially

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:10%
afunctional in writing.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if you lost
your left vocal chord,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.040 align:middle line:10%
you'd have a hard time speaking.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you lost
your left arm, it

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't interfere with
your ability to write.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
profound change.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Alfred
North Whitehead said

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that the processes that advance
civilization all but wreck

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.490 align:middle line:84%
the societies in
which they occur.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So what is the effect on
culture of introducing

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.440 align:middle line:90%
a new form of communication?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.620 align:middle line:84%
We're witnessing today a
complete discombobulation

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.220 align:middle line:84%
of our culture due
to new media that

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.003 align:middle line:84%
have been introduced--
television and radio

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
in the early part
of this century,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and now the internet and
all kinds of communication

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But this book sort
of follows what

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Marshall McLuhan said, that
the medium is the message--

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that a technology of
information transfer

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.180 align:middle line:90%
embeds itself in our psyche.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely exerts an
influence on the way we think.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:19.995 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the alphabet
changed the way people envision

00:11:19.995 --> 00:11:20.795 align:middle line:90%
their reality.

00:11:20.795 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So I maintain that all the--
if you study the alphabet

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.640 align:middle line:84%
cultures, you find that the
alphabet cultures banned

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.710 align:middle line:84%
images, got rid of the goddess,
said that there's only one god.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I know that some people
will take issue with me

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, the Bible doesn't
say that God is masculine.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.520 align:middle line:84%
But the two nouns that
are used to describe God

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.210 align:middle line:84%
are Yahweh and Adonai, which
are both-- and Elohim, which

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.560 align:middle line:90%
are all masculine.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And then all the
adjectives and nouns

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
like Lord, ruler, master,
King are masculine.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And certainly in English
when people refer to the God

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.760 align:middle line:84%
of Israel, they use
the masculine pronoun.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So the first book written in
an alphabet is actually the Old

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:90%
Testament.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:10%
There's nothing older
that has maintained

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.568 align:middle line:10%
any influence on
subsequent society,

00:12:18.568 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:10%
and in the Old Testament,
the most important part

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.840 align:middle line:10%
of the Ten Commandments.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.290 align:middle line:10%
And the first commandment
states that there is no goddess.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the first commandment
states, I am the Lord thy God.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.500 align:middle line:10%
There is no other.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:10%
So all other previous belief
systems up to that point

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.952 align:middle line:10%
had always had a
goddess and a god.

00:12:37.952 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, if I were to lay the Ten
Commandments out on the table

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:10%
here and ask you to put
them in the sequence

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:10%
of their importance,
I'd venture to say

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:10%
that you would put as
number six, which is

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:10%
don't kill, to be number two.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:10%
But don't kill isn't number two.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:10%
What's number two
is make no images.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:10%
And it isn't just graven images.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.447 align:middle line:10%
The proscription is against
anything that flies in the air,

00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.280 align:middle line:10%
creepeth on the ground,
or is under the sea.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.310 align:middle line:10%
In other words, no art.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:11.430 align:middle line:10%
So here was the first culture
who adopted a alphabetic book.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:10%
And for the first time
in the recorded history,

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:middle line:10%
we had people who worshipped
words instead of images.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And they banned images, and
they banned the goddess.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the rise of
patriarchy, though,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:84%
occurred earlier than
this, as I understand.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
The culture was already
rather patriarchal

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:90%
before the Bible was written.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's very interesting.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians had a form
of written communication

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:90%
based on images-- hieroglyphs.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And the Mesopotamians had
a form of communication

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that was written on very
abstract linear rows.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Mesopotamians
were far more patriarchal

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
than the Egyptians.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian women had a very
high standing in their culture.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But then when we see that when
Christianity began in the Roman

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
Empire, and the Roman
Empire was a polyglot

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.360 align:middle line:84%
of people experiencing
an incredibly rapid rise

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
in alphabet literacy rates
due to tutors from Greece

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.060 align:middle line:84%
and paper from--
papyrus from Egypt.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And during this period of
time, a new religion began.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning
it was based

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
on the oral sayings of an
exceedingly wise prophet named

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:90%
Jesus, who wrote nothing down.

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, given his period, given
his culture, given the time

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.360 align:middle line:84%
that he lived, it
seems extraordinary

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:84%
that he would not write anything
down that he had to say.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.480 align:middle line:84%
He told his disciples to
memorize what he had to say.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the early
years of Christianity,

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
women played a
very important role

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
until it got written
down in a book.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:10%
And then when it
was canonized, that

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.235 align:middle line:10%
was when the women were told to
move to the back of the church,

00:14:58.235 --> 00:15:00.000 align:middle line:10%
be behind a grill.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:84%
They lost the ability
to be part of the choir.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And they lost a lot
of political rights

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that they had in
the Roman Empire.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
astonishing thing

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:84%
happens when Rome falls, because
throughout secular Europe

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.510 align:middle line:90%
the Dark Ages descend.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's during the
Dark Ages that people

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
lose the ability to read and
write except for the church.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So we don't know very
much about this period.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But when the lights come on
again in the 10th century, lo

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and behold, we find
that troubadours are

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.250 align:middle line:90%
singing the praises of women.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
The age of chivalry
is in full swing.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Courtly love is all the rage.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:43.170 align:middle line:10%
And surprisingly, Mary now
plays a very prominent role

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:44.760 align:middle line:10%
in the Catholic Church.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
The first four centuries
of Christianity,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
neither the gospel
writers or Paul

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%
had much to say about Mary.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:59.370 align:middle line:10%
And yet, in the 10th century,
these magnificent cathedrals

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:10%
are being planned all over
Europe dedicated to Notre Dame.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the four most
magnificent cathedrals

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.590 align:middle line:90%
in France--

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Amiens, Chartres,
Rouen, and Paris

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%
are all dedicated to Mary.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:10%
>> So by these analogies, what
you seem to be suggesting is

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.090 align:middle line:10%
that the shift between the
worship of a masculine god

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:10%
versus the worship of a goddess
is something that we engender

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.810 align:middle line:10%
from within ourselves by
stimulating the left hemisphere

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:10%
more, in the case of worshipping
the masculine god through

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.950 align:middle line:10%
the use of the alphabet.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And when that drops
away, we drift more

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:84%
towards a
feminine-oriented culture

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:90%
in the worship of the goddess.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.075 align:middle line:10%
And then-- and the
most remarkable thing

00:16:45.075 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:10%
happened in the Renaissance
was the invention

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:10%
of the printing press.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And Gutenberg's marvel just
caused alphabet literacy rates

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to just skyrocket.

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Sir Thomas More
estimated that in his lifetime

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe 30% of Englishmen
were literate.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And when de Tocqueville
came to the United States,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
to America in the
19th century, he

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:84%
marveled that he
couldn't find a North

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:90%
American who was illiterate.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:10%
So you had this
incredible phenomenon

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.140 align:middle line:10%
occur in European culture.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And what happened immediately
after the printing press

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.819 align:middle line:90%
was the Protestant Reformation.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:10%
And the Protestants
said, now that we

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:10%
can read this book
by ourselves, we're

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:10%
going to reform the religion.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And the first target of their
attack was to get rid of Mary

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and to destroy all the images.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:43.650 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, the first thing
that the church did in 313 when

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:10%
Constantine made it
the state religion

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:10%
was to destroy all the images.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:10%
So I mean, there's
this strange iconoclasm

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:10%
that seems to go along with
people who are newly literate.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.977 align:middle line:10%
And what happened after
the Protestant Reformation,

00:17:57.977 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:10%
there's a very strange
episode that's never really

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:10%
been adequately explained,
besides these incredibly

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.370 align:middle line:10%
ferocious and savage
religious persecutions

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:10%
and heretic burnings,
the witch hunts occurred.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's never
been a culture

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in the world that decided
to destroy its wise women.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%
That never happened before.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you were to go
to a Polynesian or an Eskimo

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.427 align:middle line:84%
or a Hopi Indian
and say, would you

00:18:28.427 --> 00:18:30.510 align:middle line:84%
believe that there's a
culture in the world that's

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.750 align:middle line:90%
murdering its wise women?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
They would look at
you with disbelief,

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.550 align:middle line:90%
because nobody would do that.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And yet, for 200
years throughout only

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.490 align:middle line:84%
the literate
countries of Europe,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the ones that were giving us
Shakespeare and Galileo, Bach

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and Newton, and doing these
magnificent explorations

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
and scientific
discoveries-- those

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
were the countries
where the men had

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:57.660 align:middle line:84%
a psychosis so extreme that they
felt it was necessary to murder

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:90%
women in large numbers.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying that the way
we stimulate our brain through

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.550 align:middle line:84%
the use of the written
language and alphabet,

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
stimulating one half of
the brain excessively,

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%
causes this violence.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to make it very
clear that I am who I am

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:90%
because of alphabet literacy.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.660 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a writer.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's an irony
not lost on me that I

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
had to write a book before
I could get on a TV show.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:32.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- but I want to make it
clear that alphabet literacy is

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:39.680 align:middle line:84%
an incredibly beneficial
salutary benefit for humankind.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at all advocating that
people not read and write.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's not throw out the baby
with the bathwater here.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, Sophocles
once warned, nothing vast

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.667 align:middle line:84%
enters the life of
mortals without a curse.

00:19:54.667 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think we'll
all agree with that.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.667 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you won
the lottery, you'd

00:19:57.667 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:84%
know that there's
something that would happen

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't be wonderful.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly the invention
of writing was vast.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.827 align:middle line:90%
So what was the curse?

00:20:09.827 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And I maintain that there's
been a pernicious side

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:84%
effect of the sudden
acquisition of literacy,

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.980 align:middle line:84%
and that is that women lose
their status politically

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and economically.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:84%
The goddess disappears,
and images are execrated.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the good news is
that in the 19th century,

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:84%
we discovered photography,
invented photography,

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.480 align:middle line:90%
and discovered electromagnetism.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And those two discoveries have
been weaving back and forth.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.860 align:middle line:84%
The first produced photographs,
then film, then television, now

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:90%
computer graphics.

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world that is
now saturated with images.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just listen to
the carpool chitchat,

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:84%
or the watercooler
schmoozing, or the lingo of--

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
people are talking
about sporting

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
events or movies they've seen
or advertisings they've seen.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:10%
And we now have a culture that
the written word is balanced

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.960 align:middle line:10%
by a inundation of images.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:10%
And I believe that
it's no coincidence

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:10%
that the first feminist movement
was the suffragette movement,

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:10%
which occurred right after
the invention of photography.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:10%
And the major feminist
movement of this century

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.310 align:middle line:10%
occurred in the first
television generation.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And if you take a--

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.590 align:middle line:84%
if you put EEG leads on
somebody's brain and you give

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:84%
them a book to read-- any book,
doesn't matter what the content

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they will generate
beta waves, which

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
is what you generate when
you're concentrating on a task.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.410 align:middle line:10%
We know that if you're reading
a book in a noisy room,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.560 align:middle line:10%
you have to get up and
turn off the radio,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:10%
or leave and go
to a quieter place

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:10%
because you have to
concentrate to read.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you put
those same EEG leads

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
on the same person watching
a television program,

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't matter what
the content of the program is,

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:12.740 align:middle line:84%
they generate alpha
and theta waves,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
which is what you generate
when you meditate.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:10%
And who among us would deny
that watching television

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:10%
is an almost hypnotic process.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's almost trance-like.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe our culture was stuck
too long in the beta mode.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:35.210 align:middle line:10%
I mean, maybe we needed a
little more alpha and theta,

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:10%
because surely there hasn't
been a culture in the world as

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:10%
concerned about child
care, welfare, health care,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:10%
the environment as this one.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And I maintain that Western
culture has been primarily

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:90%
about books--

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
books written by dead white
males and imageless tomes.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.520 align:middle line:10%
And these books, whether it
was Augustine or Paul or Hegel

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:10%
or Marx or Freud, these books
influenced how and the shape

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:10%
of Western culture.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.342 align:middle line:10%
In the last half
of this century,

00:23:11.342 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:10%
for most of the
century, there have

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.860 align:middle line:10%
been no books that
could even begin

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:10%
to compare to the impact of
the image of the atomic bomb,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:10%
the image of the Earth being
back from space in '68.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, those images did more
to change the consciousness

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.080 align:middle line:84%
of people on this planet than
any book that's been written.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.573 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we got into Somalia
because of an image,

00:23:35.573 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:84%
and we got out of Somalia
because of an image.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
to tell you what

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the images are because they're
so familiar to everybody.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:90%
Vietnam was all about images.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's interesting that
the newly literate people

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of this century,
like the Taliban,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.050 align:middle line:84%
are drastically
curtailing women's rights,

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and they're banning television.

00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And the Algerians are gunning
down TV announcers and women

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:90%
who wear Western clothing.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And in Iran, if you get
found with a TV dish,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.460 align:middle line:90%
you get arrested.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.873 align:middle line:90%
So we see this strange--

00:24:09.873 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like what
Shakespeare said--

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.303 align:middle line:90%
the time is out of joint.

00:24:13.303 --> 00:24:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Here we are living
in this century

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.870 align:middle line:84%
where we have people who are
living in the 13th century,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and people who are living
in the 20th century.

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And we had different
cultures at different stages

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
of development.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Leonard Shlain, I'm going
to have to interrupt you.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:90%
We're running out of time.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But this has been a
fascinating discourse

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
into the scope of human history
and the pervasive influence

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
of something we all
take for granted--

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:90%
the alphabet.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad that you've
called it to my attention.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being with me.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us,
