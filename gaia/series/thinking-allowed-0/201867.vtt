00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:16.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Throughout recorded
history, human society

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.990 align:middle line:84%
has been haunted by reports
of unidentified flying

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.540 align:middle line:84%
objects in our
skies, many of which

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
have defied all attempts
at scientific explanation

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.460 align:middle line:90%
or understanding.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.600 align:middle line:90%
What are these phenomenon?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:90%
And how can they be explained?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
With me today is
Terrence McKenna,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
a philosopher and
thinker of note

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
in the area of altered states
of consciousness and alternative

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:90%
realities.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Terrence is the co-author
with his brother Dennis

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of "The Invisible Landscape,"
and also "Psilocybin, The Magic

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Mushroom Growers Guide."

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:84%
He is a founding member
of Botanical Dimensions,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.040 align:middle line:84%
a non-profit
organization devoted

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
to preserving and studying
psychoactive plants used

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.840 align:middle line:84%
by native cultures
throughout the world.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.739 align:middle line:84%
And he is also the developer
of a computer software package

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.580 align:middle line:84%
called Timewave Zero, designed
to augment interpretation

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Chinese book
of prophecy the "I Ching."

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Terrence.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be here with you.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure to have
you here with me also.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, the UFO
phenomenon is striking

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:90%
because it's so bizarre.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.700 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if the reports
that come in about UFOs

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
defy any attempt whatsoever
to categorize them.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
I guess from my point
of view, I can only

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:84%
assume that there are probably
many different interpretations

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:90%
of this event.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
I think given your background
as a student of shamanism

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and altered states of
consciousness and alternative

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
realities, you have some
unique perspectives on the UFO

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if we could
get into that material.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, well, the ordinary
approach to the UFOs has been

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:10%
to view them as visitors or
intruders from a nearby star

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:10%
system that have come in metal
ships for reasons of trade

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:10%
or scientific investigation
or military conquest.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Or missionary activity.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Or mission activity to
the vicinity of our planet.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And this was a myth that
sprang up but concomitant

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
with the modern wave of
sightings that began shortly

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:90%
after World War II.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.830 align:middle line:84%
As time has passed and
the number of sightings

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.350 align:middle line:84%
have gone from
hundreds to thousands

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
to hundreds of thousands of
instances, as the myth has

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
fleshed itself out
with sub-themes,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
the theme of abduction, the
theme of telepathic contact,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.920 align:middle line:84%
it's become much more difficult
to fit all the known facts

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.870 align:middle line:84%
into the simple model
of space faring visitors

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
from another world.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.940 align:middle line:84%
So what we are left
with then are a number

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of more exotic
competing theories

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
in the so-called
post-modern phase

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:90%
of thinking about the UFO.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best known of
these alternative explanations

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
was the one pioneered by
the Swiss psychologist

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung, who in 1953
wrote a book called

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
"Flying Saucers, A Modern Myth
of Things Seen in the Sky."

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And Jung was at great pains,
without passing judgment

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.410 align:middle line:84%
on the reality of the source of
things seen, to interpret them

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
psychologically,
to interpret them

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:90%
as one would interpret a dream.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And he saw in their
circular form,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
in their scintillating,
shining, alchemical brilliance

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.270 align:middle line:84%
a symbol of human
wholeness and felt

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that they were a symbol of our
collective yearning for a kind

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.440 align:middle line:90%
of totality and individuation.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a way, this kind of
explanation is very satisfying.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
However, it is not satisfying to
the person who has immediately

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
undergone a very strange and a
very real seeming experience.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Unless such a person were
told they're great messages

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
of hope for the planet.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and this is a
persistent part of the flying

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.410 align:middle line:84%
saucer phenomenon, that people
who have close contact with

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
the saucers return with messages
of universal brotherhood

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and benevolence with stories
of a beneficent hegemony

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of organized
intelligence, where wiser,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
older worlds and civilizations
help younger and less mature

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
worlds toward a kind of
galactic citizenship.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That's just one
thread of the evidence.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one thread
of the evidence.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't really well
supported by the evidence.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallee, who is one
of the foremost commentators

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
on the phenomenon, has
been at great pains

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
to point out that with the
flying saucer phenomenon,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.450 align:middle line:84%
we're dealing with thousands and
thousands of incidents per year

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard-- with even
at our own primitive level

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
of scientific sophistication,
we can learn a great deal

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.550 align:middle line:84%
about a plan that by sending
a single probe to that planet.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
What kind of scientific
program of investigation

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
requires thousands and
thousands of appearances?

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And if we make the assumption
that not all appearances are

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
observed, but that in fact only
a small number are observed,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle line:84%
then the number of appearances
that must actually be going on

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:84%
soars toward an
astronomical number.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It suggests we're dealing
with an inner penetration

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
by an alien dimension on
an almost industrial scale.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, a single
probe could cause thousands

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:90%
of appearances.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If it were of a sophisticated
enough nature, that's right.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The approach that I have
taken that has characterized

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
my work with this phenomenon
was, first of all,

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to say we have not carried out
a sufficiently in-depth survey

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
of the life already
on this planet

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say that at
some time in the past life

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:84%
did not arrive here and
thrive here that is not part

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of the general heritage
of life on this planet,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
but that is somehow come
in from the outside.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.470 align:middle line:84%
My candidate for that kind of
an intrusive extraterrestrial

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
would be probably a
mushroom of some sort

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
or a spore-bearing life
form, because spores

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:84%
are very impervious
to low temperatures

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:84%
and high radiation,
the kind of environment

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:90%
met with in outer space.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, a mushroom
spore could conceivably even

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.380 align:middle line:84%
waft itself up through the
atmosphere of our planet

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and enter into empty space.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, there's no question
but what this is happening,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:10%
that through what's
called Brownian motion,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.690 align:middle line:10%
which is sort of
random percolation,

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:10%
spores do reach the outer
edge of our atmosphere.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.030 align:middle line:10%
And there, in the presence
of cosmic rays and meteors

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:10%
and rare, highly
energetic events,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:10%
occasionally, a very
small percentage

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:10%
of these biological objects
are wafted into space.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We even possess meteorites
that are believed

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
to be pieces of the
Martian surface thrown out

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.120 align:middle line:84%
by impacts on the Martian
surface of asteroidal material.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think part of the
grappling with the UFO mystery

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to lead
to the conclusion

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that space is not an impermeable
and insurmountable barrier

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:90%
to biology.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:84%
That, in fact,
planets are islands,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and life does occasionally
wash in from distant places

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
and if conditions are
correct can take hold.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
However, let me say in the
UFO phenomenon, we are dealing

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:84%
or we presuppose
that we are dealing

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
not simply with the phenomenon
of extraterrestrial biology,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:84%
but with the phenomenon of
extraterrestrial intelligence.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:45.755 align:middle line:84%
And this is a hackle-raising
raising notion--

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We're dealing with
more than mushroom spores.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>> We're dealing with
more than mushroom spores,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
at least as
ordinarily conceived.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think the thing
that has been overlooked

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
in almost all discussions
of extraterrestrial contact

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
is how strange the
extraterrestrial is

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:90%
likely to be.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.060 align:middle line:84%
It isn't going to be a
friendly, elfin little feller

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:90%
with a beating heart of gold.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
It isn't even going to be
some of the more extravagantly

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:20.370 align:middle line:84%
grotesque creations out
of Hollywood conditions

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and time spans in the universe
are long enough and varied

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
enough that I would
bet that the real task

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.300 align:middle line:84%
with extraterrestrial
intelligence

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
will be to recognize
it, you see.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We have no conception of
how species-bound our images

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.330 align:middle line:90%
of life and biology are.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
This is a place
where we have never

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.100 align:middle line:84%
been asked to confront to what
degree the monkey within us

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.460 align:middle line:84%
is channeled our
expectations and perceptions.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it is the case that on
this planet virtually all known

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:10%
life forms are based on
the same DNA molecule.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, except that have all
life forms been examined to see

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.410 align:middle line:84%
to what degree they deviate
percentage-wise from,

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a stranded
DNA molecule?

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:90%
The answer is no.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.750 align:middle line:84%
The sequencing of DNA is
a very expensive process.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's only carried out
on laboratory organisms

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
with an extensive
history of involvement

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
in medical research, like E coli
or the ordinary laboratory rat.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
No, there's a great deal we
don't know about life on Earth.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
We don't know when
the fungi entered

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:90%
into the evolutionary chain.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what kind
of intelligence is really

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:49.730 align:middle line:84%
possessed by the cephalopods,
the shell-less mollusks that

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%
include the octopi--

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.990 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of
dolphins has been

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:90%
studied by Lilly and others--

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence of the large
primates other than man.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.130 align:middle line:84%
One way of looking at nature is
that it is entirely linguistic

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:84%
intent, that DNA is, in
fact, a way of uttering

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.570 align:middle line:84%
protein syntactical
structures into matter.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, all
of nature is like a poem.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, nature is a
communicating system of some

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
sort.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And the problem that
we have is to transcend

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
cultural languages,
historically created languages

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:84%
with very limited
applications, and instead

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:84%
fall into phase with the
communication systems

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
that nature has
placed all around us.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:84%
One possible view
of the flying saucer

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a
kind of projection

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
from the consciousness
of the planet,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
that it is Gaia,
that it is, in fact,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
a kind of alchemical object
haunting human historical time

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
with a symbol of totality,
the kind of totality

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that our religions and
our mystical yearnings

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.220 align:middle line:84%
are so at pains to
concretize for us.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.170 align:middle line:84%
But unless we as
egocentric beings

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
clarify our relationship
to the unconscious,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.750 align:middle line:84%
then I think the
flying saucer is

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
going to remain
quintessentially mysterious.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And this was Jung's view.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that Jung
pointed out in this book is

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that we must pay attention
to the research which Dr.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.335 align:middle line:84%
JB Rhine was doing at that
time at Duke University and ESP

00:12:39.335 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and psychoanalysis, and that
even if UFOs had a physical

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
reality, could be photographed
or could be weighed

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and measured, that they
still might in some manner be

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.830 align:middle line:90%
projections of the human mind.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, yes, this is an
important point to make,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
which the flying saucer people
are forever misunderstanding.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.950 align:middle line:84%
And that is saying
that the flying saucer

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is a psychic object does
not mean that it is not

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:90%
a physical object.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Jung in "Mysterium
Coniunctionis"

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is at great pains to say
that the realm of the psychic

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and the realm of the physical
meet in a strange kind of never

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.670 align:middle line:84%
never land that we have yet to
create the intellectual tools

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.110 align:middle line:90%
to explore.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
mystery of synchronicity

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.390 align:middle line:84%
is going to come to rest,
the mystery of all kinds

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of paranormal activity on
the part of human beings,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.940 align:middle line:84%
and the mystery of
the flying saucer.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
you see, that if you

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:84%
take the broad world of
the so-called mysteries,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.400 align:middle line:84%
parapsychological, shamanic,
extraterrestrial, so forth,

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and hypothesize another
spatial dimension, one

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:59.840 align:middle line:84%
more spatial dimension,
then suddenly,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
all these mysteries
become trivial.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
They are easily done.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.160 align:middle line:90%
Locked boxes are opened.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Future events are discerned.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:90%
Lost objects are found.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
This sort of thing becomes
quite the ordinary run of things

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.851 align:middle line:84%
if we hypothesize
dimensions hidden

00:14:19.851 --> 00:14:20.893 align:middle line:90%
from ordinary experience.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And, of course, there's
serious work at this point

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.350 align:middle line:84%
in the field of unified field
theory in physics to postulate

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
other dimensions of space
than we normally think of.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.070 align:middle line:84%
The current physical
models of the universe

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
require 11 dimensions,
11 integrated variables

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.250 align:middle line:90%
to describe.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's physical
models of the universe.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:84%
If we then turn our
attention to mind and realize

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
that having no
definition of what mind

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
is, why then is there
any mystery in the fact

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that we have no definition
of what the UFO is?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.650 align:middle line:84%
The mind is present at hand
in every conscious moment.

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It has been our constant
companion for 50,000 years.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't a clue
as to what it is.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, a manifestation
of the other, the super ego,

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
or the extraterrestrial
other, like the UFO,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
it is not surprising
that it is a mystery.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.940 align:middle line:84%
I always hark back to
the words of JBS Haldane,

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:84%
the great British
enzymologist, who

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:36.050 align:middle line:84%
said reality is not only
stranger than we suppose,

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:84%
it may be stranger
than we can suppose.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that suggests to
me that if we look at some

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
of the most bizarre, most
anomalous cases that we have,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.440 align:middle line:84%
such as UFOs, and we
begin to ask ourselves,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
not so much what are they
because that's a mystery,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
but what is their function?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:90%
How are they affecting us?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.140 align:middle line:84%
That's like holding up
a mirror to ourselves.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us a great
deal about the basic mystery

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:90%
of our mind and our reality.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this is the so-called
post-modern approach to ask

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:84%
the question, not
what is the UFO,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:90%
but what is it doing to us?

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Jacques Vallee
pioneered this approach.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is fascinating.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:20.780 align:middle line:10%
What the UFOs are doing to
us, to global society, is they

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:10%
are eroding faith in
science, by casting directly

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:10%
in the path of science a kind
of gauntlet, a challenge,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:10%
crack this, almost as though
the cosmic giggle had shown

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.520 align:middle line:10%
at to the bachelor party of
science to spoil the bash,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:10%
in the same way that the
Resurrection of Christ

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:10%
posed a tremendous problem
for the intellectuals

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:10%
of late Roman
antiquity, because they

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:10%
had no place in their
world view for someone

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:10%
rising from the dead.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.580 align:middle line:84%
They were Greek materialists,
atomists essentially.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.740 align:middle line:84%
In that same way, the UFO
challenges the assumptions

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:90%
of science.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.849 align:middle line:84%
And I think in that sense,
Jung was really onto something

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:84%
when he saw it as coming
from the unconscious.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:84%
It is like an object
coming from the unconscious

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:84%
with a compensatory function to
turn us away from the rational

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and toward the intuitive,
to turn us away

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:37.550 align:middle line:84%
from the paternalistic,
Apollonian, solar, masculine

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:43.190 align:middle line:84%
view of things and toward
a kind of watery, lunar,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
mysterious, intuitively
felt, feminine force,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
almost as though the UFO
is a manifestation of Gaia

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
as mother goddess.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Science as the proudest,
pardon the word,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
erection of the
rational mind then

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.800 align:middle line:84%
is challenged by something from
an entirely other dimension,

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
an entirely other
realm that concretizes

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:90%
for us the culture crisis.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I've
gotten into UFO.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I think they are important for
a resolution of the culture

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:90%
crisis.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.980 align:middle line:84%
They concretize the
struggle between

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:84%
the paternalistic masculine
and the lunar feminine,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
between a dominator society and
the kind of partnership society

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:90%
that we require to survive.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, it seems as if
that challenge is not a direct

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:90%
confrontation.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
As Vallee points out, the
UFO are operating almost

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
at the mythological
level of our culture.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
They're not landing
in the White House.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:84%
They're not really challenging
the military or NASA.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> No, they're very
mercurial, very watery.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.060 align:middle line:84%
When you reach out toward
them, there is nothing there.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:84%
What they chiefly have become
is an intellectual force

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
in human thinking
about the future.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you reach out
to grasp the hardware,

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:84%
to read the message, to meet the
alien, there is nothing there.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
I've come to the conclusion,
both from talking to contactees

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and having had a contactee
experience, that whatever lies

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:84%
behind the UFO mystery,
it is a force which

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:90%
can literally do anything.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So it is fruitless to
talk about the size

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of the objects or their
composition or color

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:84%
or the size of the entities
and their dress and weapons

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and accouterments, because
it can appear literally

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.300 align:middle line:90%
any way it wants to.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It can appear as
the Virgin Mary.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It can appear as
galactictarian overlords.

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
It can appear as gnomes, elves,
sprites, this sort of thing.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
It is not to be caught
in the rational net.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:10%
Your description is
strikingly actually parallel

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:10%
with one exception to the
view of many fundamentalist

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.560 align:middle line:10%
Christians who say
this UFO stuff is

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:10%
all the work of the devil.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know about
the work of the devil.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Jung's criticism
of Christianity was

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:23.230 align:middle line:84%
that it had not made the place
for what he called the shadow.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said the productions
of Christian culture

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:32.140 align:middle line:84%
will always be neurotic,
because the shadow has not

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.060 align:middle line:90%
been included.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lack
of psychic balance.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the UFO carries
compensatory psychic energy

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:90%
from the realm of the shadow.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very
frightened of it.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people see it as an almost
millenarian salvational hope,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:90%
the savior of mankind.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.140 align:middle line:84%
I think that it's very
powerful, that it haunts

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
time like a ghost, that
the messianic anticipations

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.390 align:middle line:84%
of fundamentalist
Christianity and Islam

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, a picking up on
the shockwave that the image

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
of the flying saucer
casts backward

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
through time, that this
image of the new Jerusalem,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
four-gated city, descending from
the sky to whisk the elect away

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:28.300 align:middle line:84%
to a better place, is a
kind of prophecy, yearning

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.510 align:middle line:84%
toward a fact in
the act of becoming.

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, Christianity and
Islam are the most history

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:38.260 align:middle line:84%
obsessed of all the
world's major religions--

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Along with Judaism.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Along with Judaism.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And all three of
them have this notion

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
of the transcendental
object at the end of time.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And alchemy in the 16th
century was an outbreak

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.310 align:middle line:84%
of an expectation of a
transcendental object

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.518 align:middle line:90%
in the nearby here and now.

00:21:56.518 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The omega point of
history, so to speak.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it would cure all ills,
confer longevity, fertility,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.110 align:middle line:90%
virility, and mortality.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
the flying saucer

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
is an airborne philosopher's
stone, the sophic hydrolith

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:16.780 align:middle line:84%
of Paracelsus, haunting
the skies of modern America

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
with a promise of mandalic
cohesion for the future

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:90%
that science has not given us.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Science has been a very
sadly disappointing religion

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:29.620 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of the heart.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.230 align:middle line:84%
The flying saucer
comes from the heart,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
but it bears the
very strange energy

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:84%
of the other in
its manifestation

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:90%
as planetary goddess.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm often struck by the
psychic powers that seem to be

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
associated with people who have
had intensive encounters with

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.880 align:middle line:90%
UFOs.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.500 align:middle line:90%
The thing--

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I've researched many
of these cases myself.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:57.670 align:middle line:10%
>> It's both material
and psychological.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:10%
It anticipates the future.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.010 align:middle line:10%
It seems as the memories
of the contactees

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:05.140 align:middle line:10%
are transparent to this force.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
It can reach deep
into their lives

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and confront them
with information

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
taken from forgotten
incidents in their lives.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:84%
It is an awesome
kind of force that

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.050 align:middle line:84%
transcends space and
time for the individual.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be
that we will never

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.080 align:middle line:84%
have a general theory
of flying saucers.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.480 align:middle line:84%
It may be that this
is something that

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:84%
addresses the individual,
in the same way that I

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.600 align:middle line:84%
don't think we will ever have
a general theory of falling

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:90%
in love.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
That, too, is something which
addresses the individual.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:84%
We have been mistaken to expect
"Time" magazine or "The New

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.860 align:middle line:84%
York Times" to explain
the flying saucers to us.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.320 align:middle line:84%
They will not explain
the flying saucers to us

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.910 align:middle line:84%
any more than they will
explain ourselves to us.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.980 align:middle line:84%
This is something that haunts
the membrane of experience,

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.910 align:middle line:84%
very close in to the
experiencing ego.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
is threatening.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the reasons that I

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
think it relates to the
psychedelic experience,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
because the psychedelic
experience is like a UFO

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
encounter on demand, where
the will of the person having

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.060 align:middle line:90%
the experience enters in.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:84%
They decide to have this
curious, symmetry breaking

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.870 align:middle line:90%
kind of experience.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
What I have tried to
say to the UFO community

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.040 align:middle line:84%
is that we will not really have
a deep understanding of what

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.030 align:middle line:84%
the contact experience
is until we include data

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:48.100 align:middle line:84%
from the psychedelic
experience as a legitimate data

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to be included when
looking at the problem.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have talked
earlier about our need to make

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
an extensive survey of all of
the biological manifestations

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:90%
on our planet.

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:84%
It almost seems that
in order to really get

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
a handle on UFO
phenomenon, we need

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:84%
to make a comparable
survey of all

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of the psychological
manifestations of which we

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
are aware.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that at some level,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.240 align:middle line:84%
you would agree
with me that the UFO

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon is one of our
psychological manifestations.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I agree.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:21.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got about
two minutes left.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.840 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if we can sort
of summarize your view

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in that regard.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I think that the
UFO phenomenon is a modern

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:33.710 align:middle line:84%
manifestation of a phenomenon
which has been with us

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.340 align:middle line:84%
That is the partial penetration
of our own cultural space

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.320 align:middle line:90%
by others--

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
pixies, elves, fairies,
sprites, demons,

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.490 align:middle line:90%
whatever you wish to call them--

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels.

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Angels.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
In the past, we had
a professional class

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with
these go betweens.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.200 align:middle line:84%
We called the professional
class shamans.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.490 align:middle line:84%
And they mitigated
these comings and goings

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and had a lore and a
mythology about them.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.420 align:middle line:84%
As we have lost contact
with our shamanic roots,

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the things which go on at a low
frequency out in the wilderness

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and deserts of this
planet have become

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to seem like us either like
invasions from another world

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.720 align:middle line:90%
or virtual impossibilities.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I think that the flying
saucer is knocking on our door

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:84%
to remind us of the
depth and strangeness

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
and animate intelligence
that is resident with us

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.190 align:middle line:90%
in nature on this planet.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Terrence McKenna, it's been
a very eloquent presentation

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:90%
and extremely thought provoking.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being with me.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always a pleasure
to talk with you.

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very
much for being with us.
