[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:15.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to be exploring

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the holographic model of
reality and its implications

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, our bodies,
and the world around us.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle line:84%
With me today is
Michael Talbot, author

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.590 align:middle line:84%
of several books, including
"Mysticism and the New

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Physics," "Beyond the Quantum,"
"Your Past Lives," and most

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
recently, "The
Holographic Universe,"

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:90%
as well as three novels.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Michael.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to be with you.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
point out in "The Holographic

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Universe" is that this is a
model that's been around now

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:90%
for a few decades, but it's--

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> --it's really beginning to
show its power in explaining

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.140 align:middle line:84%
many, many areas of personal
experience and science.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.910 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, can
we talk a little bit

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:90%
about how the model developed?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It was developed by two
men-- a University of London

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.970 align:middle line:84%
physicist named
David Bohm, who was

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
a former protege of Einstein,
and a Stanford University

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.020 align:middle line:84%
neurophysiologist
named Karl Pribram.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.270 align:middle line:90%
And they worked independently.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Pribram was studying
memory and found

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that there's evidence that the
brain operates holographically.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
And Bohm was studying
subatomic physics

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:10%
and found that on the subatomic
level, the fabric of reality

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.317 align:middle line:10%
seems to possess properties that
are reminiscent of a hologram.

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you put those
two ideas together

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:84%
that our brain seems
to be holographic

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and the universe is holographic,
it suggests that maybe--

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
it's compelling evidence
that the universe

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.300 align:middle line:90%
may be a kind of hologram.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Not that it's
literally a hologram,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:84%
but that it's a
good metaphor or way

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.170 align:middle line:90%
of understanding the universe.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Now when you say
it's holographic,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:90%
what do we mean really?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In a nutshell, that
reality may be more plastic

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.513 align:middle line:84%
and changeable like an image
than a solid construct,

00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
a sort of sticks
and stones world.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It has a couple of other
implications, one of which

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.880 align:middle line:84%
is that a hologram has
an unusual property.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:84%
If you take a piece of
photographic film that has

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:84%
a holographic image
encoded in it,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
that means that you cannot see
the image with your naked eye.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to-- to
reconstruct the image,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to shine
a laser through it.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.653 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an image
of rose in the film,

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:90%
shine a laser through the rose.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You'll get a three-dimensional
image of the rose

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.370 align:middle line:84%
If you cut that film
in half, shine a laser

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.953 align:middle line:84%
through each piece,
you'll get a whole

00:02:28.953 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:84%
rose out of each piece, which
is a very unusual property

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.612 align:middle line:84%
and sort of boggles the
imagination at first.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Cut it in four,
you get four roses.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Cut it in eight,
you get eight roses.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So if the universe is
a hologram, it means,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
as William Blake said,
that, quite literally, you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
could find the universe
in a grain of sand,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.877 align:middle line:84%
that every portion
of the universe

00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:84%
contains some semblance of the
whole, of the whole universe.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very profound.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, that's--
it's mind boggling.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.738 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that you point out

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
in a footnote of your book
that I would like to mention

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
is that this doesn't
apply for many

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
of the kinds of
holographic images

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:90%
that are popularly sold--

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yes.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> --as pendants and the like
that don't require laser light.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Every talk I give, someone comes
up and says they cut the la--

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:84%
the hologram in half on their
credit card and ruined it

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.313 align:middle line:90%
and didn't get the effect.

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:11.813 align:middle line:84%
And it only applies to those
images that you cannot see with

00:03:11.813 --> 00:03:14.188 align:middle line:84%
the naked eye, that you have
to reconstruct with a laser.

00:03:14.188 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If you were to look
at holographic film,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
it might look like
ripples on a pond,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.360 align:middle line:84%
unless the laser light
is shined through it.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
There's no decipherable
image in the film.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And it very much does look
like ripples in a pond.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Like when you drop
pebbles into a pond,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:84%
there are all sorts
of little circles.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> They're called
interference patterns.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
The same as when you drop
two pebbles in a pond

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:90%
and the ripples criss-cross.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:84%
That is exactly
what is in the film.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the criss-crossing
of the laser light

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
that's recorded on
the photographic film.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's the sense about
a hologram that there's two

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
One is this three-dimensional
image that's projected.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And it can look so real that you
want to reach out and touch it.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And in the other level are
these interference patterns.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.940 align:middle line:84%
That reality in a
hologram can be--

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:84%
can manifest in two
ways-- as a concrete image

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
or as this sort of
indecipherable blur of energy.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And an analogy to
this is like when

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
you're watching Johnny Carson
on your television set.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.980 align:middle line:84%
His image is
encoded in two ways.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.310 align:middle line:84%
One is as the concrete
image on the TV set.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.260 align:middle line:84%
One is as the blur
of radio waves

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
permeating the living room.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And if the universe
is a hologram

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
of some sense in
some way, it suggests

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that there may be two very
drastically different levels

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
to reality, that the concrete
reality we see when we look

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:84%
at these chairs and at the trees
and the clouds and everything

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
like that--

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Our bodies.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> --are just one way
that reality manifests.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And that at some deep
level, there's another--

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a level of reality
where everything dissolves

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:84%
into an ocean of energy that is
holographically interconnected,

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
where every portion
of the universe

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.530 align:middle line:84%
is contained in every
tiny area of the universe.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So that implies at this
notion that we go about

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
our everyday lives with thinking
of ourselves as separate from

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
each other and the cup is
separate from the coffee that

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
goes in the cup it, but that
these notions are somehow,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
what would you say, superficial
or contradicted at a deeper

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
level?

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're
artificial, definitely.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And Bohm really stresses this.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
interesting notion.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Because in our Western
way of thinking,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.860 align:middle line:84%
we're so attached to
the idea that when

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.130 align:middle line:84%
we come up with a concept
like an apple or an electron

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that
that exists out there.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And we forget-- it's kind of
like fish unaware of the water

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in which they swim--

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that the conceptual
pigeonholes we use,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
words, to describe reality
are phenomena inside our head.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:90%
They're not out there.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.900 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, this
is a philosophical quibble.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you get down
to quantum physics--

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.858 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
reasons that Bohm came up with

00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:90%
the holographic idea--

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:90%
it starts to have real effects.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And one of those is
it's been discovered

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
that if you take two subatomic
particles like electrons,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
in certain instances, when
you do something to one,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
it will always affect the other,
no matter how far apart they

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.460 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.168 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like
stories that you've

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
heard of identical twins
where when one is hurt,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
the other feels the pain.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is is that
we can find no process known

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
to physics that explains
how these could be sending

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:90%
a signal back and forth.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it would have to be
faster than the speed of light.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Instantaneous.

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:12.130 align:middle line:84%
It would have to be an
instantaneous signal.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein's
theory of relativity

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
said you can't have
instantaneous signals,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
because it would mean that you
could violate the time barrier

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.608 align:middle line:84%
and conceivably call
your grandfather

00:06:20.608 --> 00:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
and tell him not to
marry your grandmother.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And most physicists
say, well, this

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
would be just too
troubling to incorporate

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:84%
into a rational
picture of reality.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.607 align:middle line:84%
Bohm explains it in a
different way, which

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting way.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And he says, if you
imagine that you've

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:84%
got an aquarium in which
you have a fish swimming,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
you have a TV camera facing
the front of the aquarium,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
one facing the side
of the aquarium,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
and you have a monitor
attached to each camera,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and you also imagine
further that you

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:84%
come from a culture that's
never seen aquariums, never seen

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.660 align:middle line:84%
fish, never seen
monitors or the cameras,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:84%
all you are privy to is
the two images on this--

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
on these screens.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.555 align:middle line:84%
He says that maybe if you
look at these two screens,

00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
see a fish that--

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
a side view of a fish and
a frontal view of a fish.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't know
what the deeper reality is,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the reality of the
aquarium, you may

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
assume that these are
two separate things.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Two different fish.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Two different fish,
two different objects.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.760 align:middle line:84%
But every time one
fish moves, the other's

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.700 align:middle line:84%
going to make a
corresponding movement.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And you may then jump
to the conclusion

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that somehow the one fish
is signaling the other,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:84%
communicating to the other
to say, hey, do this,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.865 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously.

00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And Bohm says,
this is what we've

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:84%
done with subatomic
particles, that we

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.858 align:middle line:84%
assume that an instantaneous
communication is

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:84%
going on when that's not
really what's going on at all.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:10%
At a deeper level, a very
holographic level of reality,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:10%
every particle in the
universe collapses

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.455 align:middle line:10%
to a sort of cosmic unity.

00:07:34.455 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:10%
They're not
signaling each other.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:10%
They're like that fish
where there's-- the level

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:10%
of the aquarium.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:10%
And so what that means,
talking about words,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:10%
is that there is no
separation between electrons.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, there's no
separation between people.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And this has all kinds of
very boggling implications,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.725 align:middle line:84%
one of which is
that we've always

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:54.100 align:middle line:84%
tried to understand,
for example,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
psychic phenomena like how
could I get information out

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
of your head in my head as
some sort of single going back

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.010 align:middle line:90%
and forth?

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.302 align:middle line:84%
But if we're organized, if
we live in a universe that's

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
organized holographically,
you no longer

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.830 align:middle line:90%
have to tackle it that way.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It could be that I have
the entire universe

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.033 align:middle line:84%
and every neuron, every cell,
every atom, every electron

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:90%
in my head and you do also.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we can
access that, we can

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
access information
that seems to be

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:90%
beyond our normal sensory reach.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm very interested
in psychic phenomenon.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I know you've had
many personal experiences.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:10%
>> And I want to touch on it,
but this is not a model that

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:10%
was developed in order to
explain psychic phenomenon.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.710 align:middle line:10%
I think to neuropsychologists
like Karl Pribram, the fact

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:10%
that it happens to
provide an explanation

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.289 align:middle line:10%
for psychic phenomena is almost
a bit of an embarrassment,

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:10%
that he developed the
holographic model because he

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.129 align:middle line:10%
was trying to come
to terms with memory.

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, right.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.096 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's talk about that.

00:08:45.096 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Pribram was working under a very
famous neurophysiologist named

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
Karl Lashley.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was at a time
when it was believed

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.905 align:middle line:84%
that memory was stored in a
specific spot in the brain.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was something called
the proverbial grandmother

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.908 align:middle line:84%
cell, that there was
literally a cell in your brain

00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that contained the memory of
your grandmother, what you

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.910 align:middle line:90%
knew about your grandmother.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.398 align:middle line:84%
And so they did a rather
gruesome series of experiments

00:09:06.398 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:84%
for animal lovers, but it
came out with some very

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:90%
profound information.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:84%
They took rats, and they
taught them how to run mazes.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And then they would surgically
remove various portions

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
of their brain, Pribram and
his mentor, Karl Lashley.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
The reasoning being
that if they found--

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.863 align:middle line:90%
if they could remove the--

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:24.280 align:middle line:84%
a portion of the
brain and the rat

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.810 align:middle line:84%
could no longer run
the maze, they'd

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.250 align:middle line:84%
found the area of
the brain where

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:84%
the rat's memory of the
maze-running ability

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
was encoded.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Now every time they removed a
different portion of the brain,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:84%
they discovered that
they could never

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.280 align:middle line:84%
remove the memory of
how to run the maze.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.738 align:middle line:84%
They could impair
the rat's ability

00:09:37.738 --> 00:09:39.190 align:middle line:84%
so it might limp
through the maze,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:90%
but they couldn't remove it.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.062 align:middle line:84%
And really, surgeons had
known this for a while.

00:09:44.062 --> 00:09:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Doctors had known
this for a while.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Because when people
have head injuries,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
they don't forget
half of the alphabet

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:84%
or half of their family or
half of a novel they read.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They have global
memory impairment,

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:84%
where their entire
memory may be hazy,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
but memories don't seem
to be stored in our heads

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that books
are stored on a shelf.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until the '60s
when Pribram encountered

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:84%
the holographic model that says
that the whole is contained

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:84%
in every part that
he said, a-ha,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:84%
this may be what's
going on in the brain.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Specifically because
a hologram is made out

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.687 align:middle line:84%
of interference patterns,
the hologram that you see,

00:10:14.687 --> 00:10:17.062 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about earlier,
is made of the interference

00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
pattern of laser light--

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
but it can be made out of
the interference patterns

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
of any kind of energy--

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic energy,
electricity, x-rays, even.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And so Pribram said since
our synapses are constantly

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.460 align:middle line:84%
giving off electrical
impulses, these

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
are like proverbial
pebbles dropping

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
into the sort of electromagnetic
pool of our brain.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They're sending out ripples that
are constantly criss-crossing.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And he believes that's what the
brain hologram-- that's wha--

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
how we think and
how we remember,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
is through that hologram
inside the head.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> It would apply in
another sense, too.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take
a hologram image

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and cut it in half or in
quarters or in tenths,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
each time you reduce
it in size, the image

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.025 align:middle line:90%
becomes fuzzier and fuzzier--

00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.090 align:middle line:10%
>> --even though the
whole image is there,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:10%
just the way memory
would seem to be.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:59.240 --> 00:10:59.466 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
It becomes fuzzier when you have
portions of the brain removed.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.761 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:09.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And Pribram then also noticed
that the same principle applied

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:10%
for visual information
processing.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.700 align:middle line:90%
>>Well, yes.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.992 align:middle line:84%
He did not make the
discovery, but he

00:11:13.992 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
came upon the research
done by other res--

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:90%
other investigators.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is another
very interesting thing.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
As you know, Mother
Nature uses all kinds

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.750 align:middle line:90%
of mathematical languages.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.730 align:middle line:84%
When we go to understand
physical phenomena,

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.397 align:middle line:84%
we generally find
that there's some sort

00:11:28.397 --> 00:11:31.230 align:middle line:84%
of mathematical underpinning
to whatever the phenomena is.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.020 align:middle line:84%
There are uncountable
mathematical languages.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
mathematical language involved

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.600 align:middle line:84%
in the making of a hologram
is a system of mathematics

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.470 align:middle line:84%
and developed by a
French man named Fourier.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
They're called
Fourier transforms.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, it also turns
out that our brain

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.840 align:middle line:84%
uses Fourier transforms to
translate visual information.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
unusual state of affairs.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like discovering
Eskimos speaking Spanish.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not proof that the
brain is a hologram,

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
but it's suggestive that
the brain is a hologram.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, in
fact, all of our senses

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
appear to rely on sort
of Fourier transforms,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
that they all seem to
use the same mathematics.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, here's
evidence that the brain

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
uses the same mathematics to
decipher the sensory world

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.640 align:middle line:84%
as are involved in the making of
a hologram, which is, as I say,

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:84%
not proof, but
compelling evidence

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.880 align:middle line:84%
that something is
going on there.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what this seems to
suggest is a new way of looking

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:90%
at consciousness itself.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.835 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:25.835 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's an interesting thing.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.400 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that I differ
a little with Pribram.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Because Pribram thinks
that the brain--

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
as I said, that it's the
electrical interference

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.360 align:middle line:84%
patterns in the brain
that is a brain hologram.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of a mystic.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Because at a young age, I
had an out-of-body experience

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:90%
where I left my body.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And it became quite
apparent to me

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:84%
while I was having this
experience that I was thinking,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
but my brain was
back in my body,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:90%
which I could see in my bed.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew it wasn't just a
dream because I floated out

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:84%
over the ground outside
my family's house.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I saw a book
lying on the ground.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was a book by the
French short story writer Guy

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:90%
de Maupassant.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, a neighbor
said, by the way, Michael,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I lost a library book
by Guy de Maupassant.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Have you seen it?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, I
floated over it last night.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
I didn't tell the
neighbor that, but there

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:90%
are-- there was the book.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:90%
And I was always very--

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm still very
scientifically oriented.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand the
world in scientific terms.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
But it was the-- really the
first time that I sort of had

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.060 align:middle line:84%
to confront the difference
between my spiritual beliefs

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
that we can survive
our bodily death

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
and this deeply-held belief,
scientific belief of mine

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
that it's the brain
that's doing the thinking.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And I realized it was--

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.815 align:middle line:84%
I had a kind of epiphany
where I thought I--

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
it isn't the brain that's
doing the thinking.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So I am not entirely
certain that it's just

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
interference patterns-- that

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:84%
is, the brain hologram--
because those obviously would

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:90%
perish when the brain perishes.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
I think there might be some
subtler level, some subtler

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
energy that we haven't
discovered with our technology

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:90%
that's involved in this also.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Bohm's model is
relevant and interesting

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
at this point, because he's
not dealing with the universe

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
as a hologram made out of
electromagnetic interference

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.610 align:middle line:84%
He's looking at quantum
wave potentials which--

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> --are at a much deeper level.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, I've
heard Pribram discuss it

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:90%
much the same way.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:84%
There are quantum wave
potentials in the brain itself,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
which is a much more deeply
embedded level of energy

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and matter than the
electromagnetic level.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.420 align:middle line:90%
- Right.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a funny thing in science.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.840 align:middle line:84%
The great physicist,
Hermann Bondi,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.135 align:middle line:84%
said-- called it the
lure of completeness,

00:14:33.135 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:84%
that we tend-- when we find
some sort of outermost perimeter

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.637 align:middle line:84%
to what we can
measure, we assume

00:14:38.637 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing beyond it.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:90%
And I refer to it--

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like the
lu-- in ancient times,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.668 align:middle line:84%
when we only knew a certain
portion of the world,

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
people always seemed to say
beyond the edge of the map,

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
there be monsters, that
there was nothing there.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing is
going on in physics,

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that we have, with
our technology,

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:58.120 align:middle line:84%
reached down to a
certain level in reality.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's a common prejudice
among many physicists that

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.700 align:middle line:90%
beyond that level, there's--

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.500 align:middle line:90%
nothing exists.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:90%
There be monsters.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.990 align:middle line:90%
There's just a void.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's an interesting
thing that we-- as I say,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:84%
we have to have this
lure of completeness.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.523 align:middle line:84%
We have to feel that our
knowledge of the universe

00:15:12.523 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
is all that exists
in the universe.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Bohm, I think, is--

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.915 align:middle line:84%
very wisely is one of
the few physicians who

00:15:17.915 --> 00:15:19.540 align:middle line:84%
comes out and kind
of says, the emperor

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
has no clothes, says,
what rational basis do--

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
it's just prejudice that
we assume nothing exists

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:90%
beyond this level of reality.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And he feels that there are
all kinds of domains of reality

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
beyond this level--
this microscopic level.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And he theorizes that there may
be untold, uncountable subtle--

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:84%
subtler energies
in these levels.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
The quantum potential is one.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a theorized ener--
a theorized field

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that has not been measured
or discovered with science,

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
but Bohm feels there's evidence
to posit its existence.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's now rather well
accepted, I understand,

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:53.545 align:middle line:90%
among quantum physicists.

00:15:53.545 --> 00:15:54.462 align:middle line:90%
>>I wouldn't say that.

00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:55.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:15:55.262 --> 00:15:56.775 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's pretty
controversial.

00:15:56.775 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:10%
And the reason
it's controversial

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.300 align:middle line:10%
is because the standard
explanation of quantum physics

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:10%
has bought--

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:10%
has decided that-- this
lure of completeness,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:10%
that there's nothing beyond.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.860 align:middle line:10%
The Danish physicist,
Niels Bohr,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.818 align:middle line:10%
who was one of the founders
of quantum physics,

00:16:10.818 --> 00:16:12.533 align:middle line:10%
basically said there's--

00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:14.325 align:middle line:10%
you get down to a
certain level of reality,

00:16:14.325 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:10%
and things become blurry,
and you can't know anymore.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:84%
And Bohm takes a very different
route, which at this point

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is very sort of looked down
upon by a lot of physicists,

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.530 align:middle line:84%
because most have been schooled
in the way of Bohr's thinking.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And Bohm-- the quantum
potential is not looked upon

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.887 align:middle line:84%
kindly by most
physics, I would say.

00:16:33.887 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I don't think we
want to get into too technical

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.710 align:middle line:10%
a discussion of quantum
physics at the moment.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:10%
But I do think it's important
to bring up the uncertainty

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:10%
principle because it--

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.730 align:middle line:10%
in a way, it's where
physics comes full circle.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I understand,
physics are saying, well,

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:90%
there may be all kinds of stuff.

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.170 align:middle line:84%
But we'll never know it,
because we interact with it.

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Anytime we attempt
to look at particles

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
beyond a certain level, the
very act of observation changes

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.290 align:middle line:10%
And that brings us
to a point where

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:10%
we realize that the distinction
between subject and object

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:10%
breaks down.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But physicists get
very funny about it.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
They get kind of schizophrenic,
because they'll openly

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
admit that subject and
object breaks down there.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But they say that
somehow this has

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:84%
no effect in the real
world, this does not

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
translate from the microscopic
level to our level,

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.020 align:middle line:84%
although there is a sort
of creeping evidence

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:84%
in the scientific world that it
does translate into our level.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:84%
One obvious example, I
think, that it translates

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:84%
into our level is that helium
cannot be frozen solid.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Or you can freeze
hydrogen solid.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:84%
You can freeze
carbon dioxide solid.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.680 align:middle line:84%
But helium-- for helium
to go-- to become--

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
its atoms to align
in a solid form

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.390 align:middle line:84%
would violate the
uncertainty principle.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And nature doesn't
seem to allow that.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So you can't-- no matter
how cold helium gets,

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:90%
it remains a liquid.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, if-- you can have
a beaker full of liquid helium,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.430 align:middle line:84%
and that exists at our
level of existence.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sort of manifestation
of the uncertainty principle,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's-- where it's sort of
slipped over into our world.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.330 align:middle line:84%
There are other things
going on right now that--

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.030 align:middle line:84%
where there's a device
called a SQUID, which

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.618 align:middle line:84%
is a sort of electrical coil in
which it looks like we may be

00:18:16.618 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
able to demonstrate that the
current-- if you say which

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:84%
direction is the current
going in the coil,

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.640 align:middle line:84%
it's going both
directions at once,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:84%
which is kind of
an impossibility

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.190 align:middle line:90%
to simultaneously do that.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
That too is a quantum phenomena,
that these two realities

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:90%
are overlapping.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.420 align:middle line:84%
So I think we will
cross that barrier.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I must admit, Michael,
I'm not sure that I totally

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.000 align:middle line:84%
grasp the implications
of those examples.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.390 align:middle line:10%
But the examples I
would like to focus

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:10%
on that do seem more
relevant are the ones

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:10%
that suggest the enormous
ability of the mind

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:10%
to affect systems in the body--

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:56.350 align:middle line:10%
the placebo effect, the work
with healing and visualization.

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this gets away
from Bohm into Pribram,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:84%
but it's equally interesting
with equally profound

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:90%
implications.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Pribram, as I said,
says that we're

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.000 align:middle line:84%
thinking with holograms
inside our head

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and that out there
exists something that's

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:84%
more akin to the radio
waves in the room

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
from which your
TV gets the image.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
So in essence, we're kind
of conscious TV sets.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:90%
And what we think is reality.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.600 align:middle line:84%
When we look out here, it's
really just the image on the TV

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
set inside our mind, but
doesn't exist out there.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And Pribram says, this is why
there's all kinds of evidence

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that we seem to respond more
to the models of reality

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.020 align:middle line:90%
in our head than out there.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.185 align:middle line:84%
In "The Holographic
Universe," I give an example

00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:34.810 align:middle line:84%
of a psychologist
who did a study where

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
he took soldiers and marched
them all the same distance.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.700 align:middle line:90%
But he told some they marched--

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.733 align:middle line:84%
like he marched them
all 30 mi-- or 20 miles,

00:19:41.733 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
but told some they marched
10, some they marched 20,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.850 align:middle line:90%
some they marched 30.

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But they all marched
the same distance.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
At the end, he took
physiological readings

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and discovered that they were--
that their-- physiologically,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.237 align:middle line:84%
they responded not to the actual
mileage that they had marched,

00:19:55.237 --> 00:19:57.820 align:middle line:84%
but to what they had been told,
the model of reality that they

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:90%
assumed they had--

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.460 align:middle line:90%
the reality in their heads.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And in medicine, people have
used this, this application--

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the holographic
idea that we respond

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:84%
to the model of reality-- to say
this may be why we respond more

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:13.720 align:middle line:90%
to the placebos, to fake drugs.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.510 align:middle line:84%
There's a very famous
example of a fellow who

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
had lymphatic cancer,
tumors the size of oranges

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.643 align:middle line:90%
all throughout his body.

00:20:20.643 --> 00:20:22.810 align:middle line:84%
His doctor basically thought
he had about three days

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:90%
left to live.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.260 align:middle line:84%
The fellow heard about a new
drug called Krebiozen and said,

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.580 align:middle line:90%
you've got to give this to me.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.163 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said,
well, frankly, I

00:20:29.163 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:84%
don't think you
have long to live,

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:84%
and this drug takes several
weeks to take effect.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
The man implored
him, and the doctor

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:84%
gave in sort of
as an act of pity.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:90%
He gave the man Krebiozen.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.347 align:middle line:84%
And three days later,
the man's tumors

00:20:41.347 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
melted, as the doctor
put it, like snowballs

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.090 align:middle line:84%
on a hot stove-- completely
gone out of his body,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:84%
faster than the strongest
radiation treatment could've

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.750 align:middle line:90%
melted them away.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Man is up and around, walking
around his hospital room,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
resumes his normal life.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.587 align:middle line:84%
Seems to be completely
cancer free.

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Several months down the line,
he reads an article saying

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Krebiozen isn't that effective.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.330 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:90%
All his tumors come back.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:90%
He's back in the hospital.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The doctor starts to
realize that maybe it

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
wasn't the drug that cured
the man but the man's belief.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
So he lies to the man and he
says, those articles are wrong.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.485 align:middle line:90%
Krebiozen is effective.

00:21:12.485 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, I've got an even
more potent version of it.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
He injects just saltwater
into the man's veins.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Again, the man's
tumors melt away.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.920 align:middle line:90%
He resumes his normal life.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, many
months down the line,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:84%
he reads final
studies on Krebiozen,

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
saying it's completely
ineffective.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Boom, boom, boom.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:84%
His tumors come
back, and he dies.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line
is somehow this man

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.960 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to access some
deep level of healing cau--

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.802 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't the drug, because
saltwater worked just

00:21:38.802 --> 00:21:40.690 align:middle line:90%
as well as this alleged drug.

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And so, again,
here's an instance

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:middle line:84%
where he responded to
the model of reality

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
in his head, this deep belief
that this drug would heal him,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.190 align:middle line:84%
even though he
wasn't even receiving

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:84%
the drug at a certain
point in his treatment.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And his body responded in kind.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is the
most exciting aspect

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:90%
of the holographic idea.

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.655 align:middle line:84%
And there are countless
examples of it.

00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:00.078 align:middle line:84%
There's a study of a new
chemotherapy in England

00:22:00.078 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
where they took a group
of cancer patients.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.453 align:middle line:84%
Half the patients,
they gave the drug.

00:22:03.453 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Half the patients, they
gave a placebo, a fake.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.045 align:middle line:84%
No one knew who was receiving
the real drug or not.

00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:10.295 align:middle line:84%
They told all the patients,
this is a very toxic drug.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:90%
May cause you to lose your hair.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
30% of the people receiving
just the fake lost their hair.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.065 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard this,
I immediately thought, oh,

00:22:18.065 --> 00:22:20.440 align:middle line:84%
my gosh, about every donut
that I'd ever eaten in my life

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and thought, oh, this is
really bad for me, that I'm--

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I may be responding to
the model of reality

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:30.460 align:middle line:84%
more than the nutritional
aspects of the donut.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the stories
of this kind have been known

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.472 align:middle line:84%
to scientists for hundreds,
hundreds of years,

00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:38.680 align:middle line:84%
but they've kind of been
dismissed because scientists

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.670 align:middle line:84%
haven't had a good way to
look at the possibility that

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
consciousness can
affect physical systems,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.210 align:middle line:84%
that we think of consciousness
as an epiphenomenon.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:10%
>> But if one considers that
there are standing waves,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.790 align:middle line:10%
interference patterns
in the brain,

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:10%
holographic images that
gives consciousness a--

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I hate to use the
term mechanism,

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:10%
because I don't
think that's quite--

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.363 align:middle line:90%
>> --the right term.

00:23:03.363 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But it gives people
a model in which

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.510 align:middle line:84%
they can begin to
appreciate more

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:08.870 align:middle line:90%
of the role of consciousness.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And it also can be
applied in another way.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:10%
Because if the universe is
organized holographically--

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.278 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we've always believed
that there is no connection

00:23:18.278 --> 00:23:19.570 align:middle line:10%
between the brain and the body.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:10%
And, of cour-- I mean,
for most of the history

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.530 align:middle line:10%
of medical science in the west.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.048 align:middle line:84%
In the past couple
of decades, we're

00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:26.590 align:middle line:84%
starting to say
there's a connection.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.380 align:middle line:10%
And we're sorting
out certain pathways,

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:10%
the neuropeptide systems,
that sort of thing.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:84%
But if the holographic
model is correct,

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
interconnections

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and the body,
there ceases to be a division.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes
almost a moot point

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.645 align:middle line:90%
to say, what is the pathway?

00:23:41.645 --> 00:23:43.270 align:middle line:84%
How is the brain
connected to the body?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no
difference, just

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.253 align:middle line:84%
like there's no difference
between those two electrodes.

00:23:47.253 --> 00:23:49.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and to take it a
step further, as you do,

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.410 align:middle line:10%
one might say there is no solid,
clear-cut distinction between

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:10%
ourselves and the rest
of the whole universe.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this has
profound implications

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.310 align:middle line:10%
for spiritual experiences,
of which you've

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:10%
had quite a number.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps in the
time remaining,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
we should touch
on more of those.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very much so.

00:24:06.837 --> 00:24:09.128 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I've always been
very interested in science,

00:24:09.128 --> 00:24:11.020 align:middle line:84%
but I also grew up in
a very-- with a lot

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
of very unusual experiences,
not the least of which

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
is that I grew up in a house
with a poltergeist haunting.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So I had all kinds of
examples of psychokinesis,

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.680 align:middle line:84%
of objects moving about on their
own, when I was growing up.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And I really-- it was strange
in the sense that for me,

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.460 align:middle line:90%
it was normal.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn
that it was abnormal,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and a rather painful
learning as I grew up.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And my friends would
find it very strange

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:90%
that these things would occur.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that Bohm says,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:84%
because Bohm addresses the topic
of psychokinesis, is, again,

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.950 align:middle line:90%
we don't--

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.608 align:middle line:84%
we may be mistaken to try
to approach psychokinesis

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
by saying, what energy
is leaving the brain

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:90%
to move the object?

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Because as Bohm says, there's
no division between the objects.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychokinesis means
mind over matter.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.332 align:middle line:84%
Moving the objects with
just the power of thought

00:24:55.332 --> 00:24:59.820 align:middle line:84%
alone, that we are as connected
to that object as borderless.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.510 align:middle line:84%
We're a continuum
with the object

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:90%
as the patterns in a carpet.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So for us to move
the object, maybe it

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
bumps as just an
act of resonance,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.590 align:middle line:84%
of realizing that there's
no division between us.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And can we talk for a moment
about the issue of life after

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
death or spiritual experiences
of other realities?

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.343 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the areas
you had mentioned earlier,

00:25:23.343 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that one of the exciting things
about the holographic idea

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.000 align:middle line:84%
is that people have
taken this and explored

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:84%
all different realms, that
some have used it to say

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:90%
this is how acupuncture works.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.958 align:middle line:84%
Because it turns
out that there are

00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:35.620 align:middle line:84%
little micro-acupuncture
systems where

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.670 align:middle line:84%
you can find the entire
body in the acupuncture

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:90%
points of the ear.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Recapitulated--

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the ear, yes.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.630 align:middle line:84%
That we've talked about
the placebo effect--

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.327 align:middle line:84%
some have said that the
holographic idea applies

00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:47.410 align:middle line:90%
in near-death experiences.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.690 align:middle line:10%
One of these individuals
is Kenneth Ring

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:10%
who is at the University
of Connecticut,

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:53.225 align:middle line:10%
studies near-death experiences.

00:25:53.225 --> 00:25:54.100 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Because in report
after report of people

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.382 align:middle line:84%
who have been declared
clinically dead--

00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:00.340 align:middle line:84%
go through some apparent
other level of reality

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.360 align:middle line:90%
and then come back--

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:84%
they refer to this
other level of reality

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
with terms like frequency
and energy and even hologram,

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:90%
that it's a plastic--

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.940 align:middle line:84%
a more plastic level of
reality, where thought

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.440 align:middle line:84%
seems to create
things instantly.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:84%
There are instances of people
having near-death experiences

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.653 align:middle line:90%
where they think they're hungry.

00:26:15.653 --> 00:26:16.870 align:middle line:90%
And instantly, food appears.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps an even
better example--

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
when people find themselves
out of their body,

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:84%
there are cases where
people look down and see

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.200 align:middle line:90%
that they're in a naked body.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.980 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh, my gosh.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm naked.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, they
have clothing on.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't assume that
clothing has a soul, that it

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
has a spirit that survives.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, it appears that
the mind can sort of pull out

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.973 align:middle line:84%
of this ocean of frequency
a hologram of clothing.

00:26:35.973 --> 00:26:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
Ken Ring says is,

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:84%
is that we're entering
deeper into the hologram when

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
we have near-death experiences,
when we leave our bodies.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's so many different
areas that have kind of been

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.940 align:middle line:84%
at the fringes of our
understanding that we can now

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.730 align:middle line:90%
begin to look at with new eyes.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Michael Talbot, it's been a
pleasure to have you with me.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And for those of
you watching, you

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.100 align:middle line:84%
may be interested in knowing
that this discussion will

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:84%
be part of a "Thinking Allowed"
inner work videotape available

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
along with an additional
hour of discussion

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:84%
going deeper into these
questions with Michael Talbot.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:10%
Michael, thanks so
much for being with me.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure, Jeffrey.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:18.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.730 align:middle line:90%
