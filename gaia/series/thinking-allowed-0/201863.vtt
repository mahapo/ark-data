[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:17.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
the province of the mind.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
With me is Dr. John C
Lilly, a noted pioneer

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:84%
of mystical states and states
of consciousness, and also

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:90%
interspecies communication.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Lilly is a former researcher
with the National Institutes

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
of Health, the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Center,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
he is the author
of some five books

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.188 align:middle line:84%
on human-dolphin communication,
including "Lilly On Dolphins,"

00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:48.230 align:middle line:84%
"Man and the Dolphin,"
"The Mind of the Dolphin,"

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:90%
"Communication With Dolphins."

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:84%
He has written many books
on deep inner exploration,

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
including "The Deep Self,"
"The Center of the Cyclone,"

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
"The Diatic Cyclone,"
and "The Scientist."

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's particularly
noted for programming

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and meta-programming of
the human biocomputer.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he introduced
that term, the biocomputer,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.520 align:middle line:90%
into our language.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, John.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a real pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be good to
start with your famous maxim

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
about what is true in
the province of the mind.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.530 align:middle line:90%
Could you begin by--

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>> In the province of mind,
where one believes to be true,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
either is true or becomes
true within certain limits.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.570 align:middle line:84%
These limits are to be
found experimentally

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:90%
and experientially.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
When so found, these
limits turn out

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
to be further beliefs
to be transcended.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:84%
In the province of mind
there are no limits.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.320 align:middle line:84%
However, in the
province of the body

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
there are definite limits
not to be transcended.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You've probably
devoted your whole life,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and certainly many decades
recently, to pushing, to see,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, what really
were the limits.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Going into new realities,
taking on the belief systems

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.310 align:middle line:84%
of those realities,
and then coming back

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
to your basic working reality
and challenging those beliefs,

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
integrating those
beliefs with your own.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
In your writings, you've
explored almost every state

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.550 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness
I could imagine--

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
the various mystical
levels of Satori,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
communication with
extraterrestrials,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:84%
communication with
other species.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You've established, probably,
a more significant mapping

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:84%
of inner space than almost
any other modern person,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and I think we all owe a
great debt to you for that.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't get stuck with those.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.650 align:middle line:90%
I've abandoned all of them.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.410 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.210 align:middle line:10%
>> It's impossible, because
the infinities are in the mind.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the
beauty of your work,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is that you keep moving
further and further,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
further and further out.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
In The Center of
the Cyclone, you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.570 align:middle line:84%
described that you had a
whole system, virtually,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.700 align:middle line:84%
a quantitative
system for mapping

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.870 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
one that I found

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
most fascinating, what you
call plus three, mega-Satori.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And in that state you
describe going so far

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
out of your body, even out
of the physical universe,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to the point of being
at the level of essence

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
in which the physical
universe is created.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That almost seemed to me
in reading that book like

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
an ultimate state
of consciousness.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.530 align:middle line:84%
But I know you wrote about
it some 15 years ago.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.690 align:middle line:90%
How does it look to you now?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's one
step beyond plus three.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.770 align:middle line:84%
That's plus one, but you're not
allowed to remember that once

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:90%
you go into it.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:90%
You have union with God.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the true yoga.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:90%
And so you're non-human.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's no way you can
recount what happened.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:90%
You have no way of saying it.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:90%
It goes beyond language.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:84%
>> All those states
are beyond language.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Language is a very poor
instrument to express them.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You've described in some of
your other writings language

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.900 align:middle line:84%
as being a film, a thin film
that separates us from reality,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.700 align:middle line:90%
really.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:84%
As much as we try
to use language

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.400 align:middle line:84%
to describe what we mean,
it really puts barriers up.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's one use
of language that's valid.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.261 align:middle line:84%
That's the injunctive use,
telling you how to do things.

00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:90%
The descriptive one's very poor.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.052 align:middle line:90%
And William James said it.

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The other realities are
separate from this one,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.135 align:middle line:90%
but the film is the screen.

00:04:43.135 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.928 align:middle line:84%
And I found this
screen is language.

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
abandon it when you're

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.850 align:middle line:90%
going to these other realities.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to plus
one and plus three,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.175 align:middle line:90%
you've mapped out plus six.

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
That's a state of
consciousness, as I recall,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:84%
in which the mind can
travel to any point

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:84%
in physical or
non-physical space.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But you maintain
your individuality.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That must be a basic
mode of a psychic explorer.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I gather, from reading
much of your work

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
that you've spent a great
deal of time, in plus six.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, and in plus 12.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Plus 12 is the blissful idiot.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You're in your body, right here,
now but everything is happy.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.615 align:middle line:84%
Gold dust particles in the
air, everything is good.

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> You can feel energy moving
in and out of the different

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:90%
psychic centers of the body.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If a bird calls, you hear
it echoing through the galaxy.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
much use unless you

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.830 align:middle line:84%
can get another blissful
idiot in the same space.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the mystical
teachings warn against getting

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.050 align:middle line:84%
stuck in some of
these realities.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I haven't been in any
of them since that time.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you also refer to,
in your mapping of states,

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, is plus 48, which
is sort of a perfectly neutral

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:10.630 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Plus 24 is the professional
state of any discipline

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.527 align:middle line:84%
that you're involved in, where
you're lost in the discipline.

00:06:20.527 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
48 is where where
you're communicating

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.980 align:middle line:90%
with everybody else.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
the minus state,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.150 align:middle line:90%
but I don't go into those.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But at one point you wrote
about the importance of going

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
into the minus states and
remaining perfectly aware,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
being conscious in
those negative states.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Not trying to block
out the negativity.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And you describe that, as
I recall, as burning karma.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.508 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a--

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:84%
in The Center of
the Cyclone, there's

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:84%
a chapter called A Guided Tour
of Hell, which was minus six.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And that was awful.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So I never had to
go back to that,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.752 align:middle line:84%
and I was never
frightened again.

00:07:03.752 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I was totally
terrified in that one.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I suppose it's what the
Christian mystics sometimes

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:84%
referred to as the
dark night of the soul.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was the
dark night in my soul.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps this is a necessary
part of everybody's journey,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:84%
is to go through the
epitome of terror.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And for instance, there's
an Iranian psychiatrist

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and an American
psychiatrist that

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
put 100 patients in a
mental hospital in Iran,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:84%
through what they
feared most on ketamine.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:90%
And they all left the hospital.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, I tried the
same thing later,

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
after I read that, that
evening, I took 150 milligrams

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of ketamine.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the Earth
Coincidence Control Office

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.405 align:middle line:84%
removed my penis
and handed it to me.

00:07:53.405 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I screamed in
terror, my wife Toni

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.770 align:middle line:84%
came running in
from the bedroom.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it's
still attached.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So I shouted at the ceiling,
who's in charge up there,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.120 align:middle line:90%
a bunch of crazy kids?

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The answer came back, well,
you had an unconscious fear,

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:90%
so we put you through it.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Just the way the Iranian
psychiatrist did.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> In the realm of the mind
and the province of the mind,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:90%
we can face all of our fears.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you may not be able
to, but you should try it.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I often find in dreams--

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the things that
would destroy the body,

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.290 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of the mind, don't.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.659 align:middle line:84%
The survival programs,
as I found out earlier

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
when doing neurophysiology,
are built into the brain.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.419 align:middle line:84%
The rewarding systems,
euphoric systems,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and the sexual systems, and then
the painful, punishing, anger,

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and so on, systems
are all built in.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize that
the cerebral cortex has

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.225 align:middle line:84%
many, many paths to these
systems and from these systems,

00:08:54.225 --> 00:08:56.100 align:middle line:84%
so you don't have to go
through these states.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's focus a little bit on
some of the terms you defined

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:90%
a moment ago.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.650 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned ketamine.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:07.210 align:middle line:90%
What is ketamine?

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Ketamine is the most commonly
used anesthetic for very young

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:10%
children and old people.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:15.655 align:middle line:10%
And in the literature,
their emergence symptoms

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:10%
are described, Emergence meaning
coming out of the anesthetic.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And some doctors don't like
those emergence symptoms rooms

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:84%
so they won't use it but others
know what they are so they just

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.380 align:middle line:84%
hold the hands of the patient
and help them come out.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
It was the most commonly
used anesthetic in Vietnam.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Some places won't use it at all.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But basically what a strong
dose of ketamine will do is

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.460 align:middle line:90%
make you unaware of your body.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it can.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't like it anymore.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> But it creates a state
where one can enter into inner

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:84%
realities, free from the
attachments of the body.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> ECCO told me to stop using it
and get back here and learn how

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to be human.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in your
book The Scientist,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.290 align:middle line:84%
you describe going through
a period of very intensive

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
explorations with vitamin K, as
you described it at that point,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.332 align:middle line:84%
to the extent that
people thought--

00:10:20.332 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's not clear to me
whether you were or were not

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:90%
addicted to the substance.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well when one is doing
research on a substance,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:31.150 align:middle line:84%
one takes it so frequently
that outside observers can say

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.780 align:middle line:84%
you're addicted, but that's
a very bad definition

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:90%
of addiction.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in many ways, whether
you were or weren't, one has

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:84%
to admire your willingness
to always push the frontiers

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:90%
of our knowledge further.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that that was
your motivation for the work

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%
that you did.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Any good researcher is
obsessive and compulsive.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> You also mentioned
the term ECCO.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:90%
What is ECCO?

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>> E-C-C-O. In Italian
it means, this is it.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
But it means to me, the Earth
Coincidence Control Office,

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
which is one of
God's field office.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:17.124 align:middle line:84%
And ECCO runs our lives,
though they won't admit it.

00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're an ECCO agent,
you can be very, very careful

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to use your best
intelligence in ECCO service,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and you realize there are no
discoveries, only revelations.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And that was a come down for the
scientists, me as a scientist.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I've found in
my own work in the media

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:10%
and in parapsychology
that I'm very much guided

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:10%
by coincidences.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess it's looking
to coincidences as signs along

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.420 align:middle line:84%
the way that defines this
relationship with what

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.140 align:middle line:90%
you've defined as ECCO.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:54.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:54.982 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The Earth Coincident
Control-- it's

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
coincidence control,
what they do.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And they say we control
the long term coincidences,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:84%
you control the short term
ones, and when you find out

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.460 align:middle line:84%
how we do the long term
ones, you no longer

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%
have to remain on Earth.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.390 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to return there.

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me as if your
concept of ECCO is a way

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of modeling, perhaps, a
mechanism behind what Jung has

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:90%
defined as synchronicity.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Jung define synchronicity,
only a good fashion,

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in his introduction
to the I Ching.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:90%
He uses the term coincidences.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Meaningful coincidence.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, coincidences,
or in your own construction,

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.150 align:middle line:84%
your own language
construction, of the events.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:90%
So it's all a fake too.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
As I said at the
beginning of my workshops,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:54.230 align:middle line:84%
everything I say here
is a lie, bullshit.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Because anything that you put
in words is not experience,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:90%
is not the experiment.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a representation,
a misrepresentation.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet here we are,
misrepresenting to each other,

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
in order that we can
learn from these lies.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Now if you use
language injunctively,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as a set of
directions, then it's

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:90%
not as bad as it is otherwise.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So in other
words, for example,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.450 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about ECCO,
when you talk about, perhaps,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
going into an inner reality
using a sensory isolation tank,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.020 align:middle line:84%
which is one of the other
technologies in which you

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:90%
pioneered or--

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>> 1954, I invented it.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Or using a number of
different molecules which can

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
be used for this purpose,
or mystical disciplines.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
When one enters into
these realities,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:84%
each set of instructions carries
with it, usually, a belief

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And basically what you're
saying is that all of these

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:84%
belief systems are wrong,
but one needs to entertain

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
or to hold the belief system
in order to follow through

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:90%
the instructions.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Our brains are so small,
that we have to do this.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So the belief system itself
becomes a tool that we work

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.070 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
we have to let go of.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And using these
belief systems,

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you've been able to, in effect,
map out the inner terrain

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of inner space in a manner which
has as rich and varied flora

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:84%
and fauna and geography as one
would find on any continent.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps richer.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you take the
same kinds of trips,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
you'll find a different
flora and fauna.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Different kinds.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Each time.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
So in the province of the
mind, there are no limits.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, if one pushes that
very, very far, I guess one--

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
no limits almost means
nothing, there's nothing there.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:90%
Limits is what defines things.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.775 align:middle line:90%
It's what creates form.

00:14:56.775 --> 00:14:58.275 align:middle line:84%
>> I haven't thought
of it that way.

00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are no limits
that you put on it previously,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and new limits may appear, which
define it an entirely new way,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
which is much larger.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.272 align:middle line:90%
That's all that means.

00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I almost have
the sense, though,

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.400 align:middle line:84%
that if there are no limits
in the province of the mind,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.320 align:middle line:84%
that we humans and other beings,
we create limits of our own

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.850 align:middle line:90%
to make it interesting.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.680 align:middle line:90%
To make the game worth playing.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't live as a
human without limits.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's your body.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.505 align:middle line:84%
>> They're built
into your brain.

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:34.400 align:middle line:84%
The pattern recognition systems
in your brain, for instance.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
If one hallucinates,
say, on cocaine,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
one sees a bush over there
as an old lady crying

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
with a shawl over her head,
and you walk over to the bush,

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and somebody else looks at--

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and they're on the cocaine,
looks at that same bush,

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:90%
they'll see the old lady crying.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
So this apparently is belief
pattern, recognition systems

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
that are built into
our brains, that

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:90%
are given at birth, probably.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, in
certain altered states

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.280 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, there
is an ability, I suppose,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.210 align:middle line:90%
to be telepathic.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.898 align:middle line:84%
To cognize the thoughts
directly of another person.

00:16:11.898 --> 00:16:13.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's more than that.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
It's-- the particularly noisy
pattern of the bush in striking

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:84%
your brain is reorganized,
personified by the brain.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And all brains do
the same thing,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.540 align:middle line:84%
even if you're not
in mental telepathy,

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:90%
telepathic communication.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Though you have all of it there.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.170 align:middle line:90%
Do you know about alternity?

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Alternity, that's
a wonderful word.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I experienced alternity very
dramatically when I came back

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:45.160 align:middle line:90%
from Chile.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And I sat in Elizabeth
Campbell's living room

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
in Los Angeles in what
I called the prophet

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
meditation, sitting on
the floor, my spine ramrod

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:90%
straight.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly a line of light
comes down through my spine,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and the leaves of different
realities all around me.

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.978 align:middle line:84%
And I could look
into the future.

00:17:07.978 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And the present is right
here, and each of those,

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.869 align:middle line:84%
it goes on out to
many years from now.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.310 align:middle line:90%
It goes infinitely upwards.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's tremendous amount
of power going through this.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
The next morning I
was thrown out of bed

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:90%
by the Sylmar earthquake.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, gee,
did I cause that?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:84%
That was the same energy
that went through me.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.755 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that this was hubris.

00:17:32.755 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
He whom the gods would
destroy, they give hubris.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> They first fill with pride.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I lost my pride
and I realized that I

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.750 align:middle line:90%
couldn't explain either of them.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But alternity is, as
you've described it, then,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
would seem to be a space in
which you're in touch with many

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
alternate realities--

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --all simultaneously.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you get
caught with one, as I did.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:10%
>> It seems very
similar, in a way,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:10%
to what physicists are
describing when they talk about

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:10%
the multiple universe
interpretation of quantum

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:10%
physics.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And Francis Jeffries
is writing my biography

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and he describes
alternity from the wave

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:90%
function of quantum mechanics.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you collapse it,
you've chosen one alternate.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You've referred several
times now to the fact that

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
in the province of the
body, there are limits.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And you yourself have
thrown yourself up

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
against those limits
on many occasions

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and have written about it.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.880 align:middle line:84%
In your writing, you seem
to be warning people, maybe,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:84%
not to do everything
that you've done.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:90%
They don't have to.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.410 align:middle line:90%
See this hand?

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
I have to keep it in
ointment because 11/11/87

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.630 align:middle line:84%
I drove my car up a slide bank,
turned it over, and totaled it.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And this was the battery
acid burned this hand.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And these knuckles were
broken, and that's all.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
If I'd had my seat belt on
I would've been decapitated.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But ECCO was showing
me something.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That I wasn't exploring
alternates properly.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
I was caught with one.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a wonderful section
in your book The Scientist

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in which you describe a
conversation amongst different

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
beings in an altered state, who
were describing how carefully

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:84%
they worked to create all the
coincidences so that you could

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
have an accident in which
you nearly died and were

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.000 align:middle line:84%
resuscitated by your wife
Toni, who had just learned

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
three days earlier.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Then the other accident,
the one that closed off

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.070 align:middle line:84%
vitamin K from me, where I was
on a 10 speed bicycle going

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.050 align:middle line:84%
down Decker Canyon
Road, and the chain

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:90%
caught and I hit the road.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.083 align:middle line:90%
Nine bones were broken.

00:20:00.083 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
What I didn't say
in The Scientist

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.610 align:middle line:84%
is that I was on PCP at the
time, 42 milligrams injected.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So I was out in the hospital
for five days and five nights.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.635 align:middle line:84%
I was taken by ECCO
to planets that

00:20:12.635 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
were being destroyed
by supernova waves,

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:90%
by atomic warfare, and so on.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:90%
It was incredible.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Then I try to come back here,
I come back, Toni'd be there,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I'd grab on to her and hold
on for six, seven hours,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
then they'd take me back out.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't finished the lesson.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
think the lesson is?

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the lesson in that case
was look up the dose for PCP

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:10%
before you take it.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:10%
It's 2 milligrams, not 42.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And the other
lessons, of course,

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:84%
were I came back wanting
to put on radiation suits.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That this planet
is not very stable.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:90%
It can be destroyed any time.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a sense,
and, you know,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.660 align:middle line:84%
the way in which
you live your life,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.760 align:middle line:84%
right out on the very edge
of what would be called-

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
not just normalcy or the edge
of what is conventionally safe

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
to do, but the very edge of
what is physically possible

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:90%
for a human being to do.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Exploring the
limits of the body.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And that in so doing,
well, of course,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:84%
you've discovered that, like
the fool in the Tarot deck,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
you put yourself into this
position of nascent wisdom

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
in which you're bound
to make mistakes.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.120 align:middle line:84%
One can't explore the way you
have without making mistakes.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.015 align:middle line:84%
And yet those very mistakes
seem to propel you even deeper.

00:21:38.015 --> 00:21:39.765 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a saying,
there are no mistakes,

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.770 align:middle line:84%
there're only
correctable errors.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.555 align:middle line:84%
There are no errors, there're
only alternate programs.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:90%
And that is escape the guilt.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> There is a sense in which--

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, you've lived your life
so much in the internal reality

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:84%
that I almost feel like, you
know, you being with me here

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
in the TV studio, it's
like you've come up

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
for air a little bit to
breathe together with us

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and to share what it's like
in these vast, vast realms

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
light years away from
planetside reality.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I call that insanity, and
when we're talking together

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:90%
we're in outsanity.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And you should never try to
express all of your insanity

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:84%
in the outsanity or
they'll lock you up.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But in a way, you've
expressed more of your insanity

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
than most people
would ever dare to.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of
people take my work as--

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
my books as a permission
to go further with that.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> One would almost think
that an entire generation,

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
perhaps several generations
of people now feel much freer

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.080 align:middle line:84%
to describe their own inner
experiences because of people

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:84%
like you doing it at a time
when it was much riskier.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm always surprised at
how many people read my books

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:90%
and been influenced by them.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can certainly say
that that's the case for me.

00:23:05.057 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you'll like the
new edition of The Scientist.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:10.320 align:middle line:84%
It has all the things I
left out of the first one.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.220 align:middle line:84%
75 new pages in, and
50 new photographs.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And I admit that it was
ketamine, not vitamin K.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're not using
ketamine currently.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't like it anymore.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you still doing
work in sensory isolation?

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Once in a while.

00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But I never talk about
what I'm doing currently.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Remember the human biocomputer?

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.117 align:middle line:84%
>> I was doing that work with
LSD in the tank in St. Thomas,

00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:44.950 align:middle line:84%
and the National Institute
of Mental Health,

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:84%
in which I had a fellowship,
thought I was just working with

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:48.360 align:middle line:90%
dolphins.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:84%
So when I sent them
human biocomputers,

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.007 align:middle line:84%
the report for five years of
the fellowship, they wrote back,

00:23:53.007 --> 00:23:54.590 align:middle line:84%
we didn't realize
we were going to get

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.890 align:middle line:90%
a monograph from this work.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think they read it.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And they cut off your
funding shortly thereafter,

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.090 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Somebody told the people
supporting the dolphin research

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that I had brain
damage from LSD.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I got that
rumor, so I took it

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:17.035 align:middle line:84%
to the head of the
Mental Health Council

00:24:17.035 --> 00:24:18.818 align:middle line:90%
that was supporting the work.

00:24:18.818 --> 00:24:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was the head of
the Neurological Institute

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And he got angry
when I said that.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:26.295 align:middle line:84%
So he spent three
days examining me.

00:24:26.295 --> 00:24:28.285 align:middle line:84%
I've never had such a
thorough examination.

00:24:28.285 --> 00:24:29.865 align:middle line:90%
He got angrier and angrier.

00:24:29.865 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
He said, there's
absolutely no evidence.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
He said, do you want
any more research money?

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said no, I've quit that.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So he said, all right,
I'm going to fire

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.860 align:middle line:84%
two people, one in the institute
and one in my committee.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.470 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I suppose
for our culture,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:10%
the really special thing about
you is the fact that you really

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.440 align:middle line:10%
have a foot in both
worlds, the scientific camp

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:10%
and the mystical camp.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, you seem
dissatisfied with both of them.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.890 align:middle line:84%
Neither camp seems to provide
an adequate enough model

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:04.390 align:middle line:90%
of reality for you.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.340 align:middle line:84%
>> My own beliefs
are unbelievable.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And you seem to be saying
that it's up to each person

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.020 align:middle line:84%
to, in effect, make the
same bridge that you have

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.710 align:middle line:84%
and to create their own belief
system so that in creating that

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:22.580 align:middle line:84%
belief, they can move into the
state that that belief leads

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
them to so that they can
then discard it again.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.860 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the gnostic
point of view,

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.334 align:middle line:10%
self-transcendence not
transcendence through a church

00:25:31.334 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:10%
or a group.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Back 15 years ago or so,
you were exploring the mystical

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.420 align:middle line:84%
states is described classically
as the various levels

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.420 align:middle line:84%
of samadhi, and your work
with Oscar Ichazo in Chile,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.890 align:middle line:90%
in the Arika School.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had achieved, as
we had described earlier,

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:84%
some of the very highest states
of those mystical traditions.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And you wrote about them from
your own personal experience.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.660 align:middle line:84%
People in the
mystical traditions

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.205 align:middle line:84%
view these states as
being ultimate states.

00:26:06.205 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I get the sense
from you that you

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.788 align:middle line:90%
don't think of them that way.

00:26:08.788 --> 00:26:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You think of them more the way
a scientist would look at tools.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>> [INAUDIBLE],, for
instance, 400 BC,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.630 align:middle line:84%
said when you reach the
highest form of samadhi,

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:84%
you realize there are
hundreds more beyond that.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.900 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with all of it.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, John Lilly, it's been
a pleasure having you with me.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:26:34.045 --> 00:26:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure being here.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.950 align:middle line:84%
You sure do know how to
ask the right questions.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very
much for being with us.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:90%
