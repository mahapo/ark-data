>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is part two
of our two-part program

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
on the religious significance
of entheogenic plants

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:90%
and chemicals.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.270 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Professor
Emeritus Huston Smith,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:84%
author of "The World's
Religions," "Forgotten Truth,"

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.090 align:middle line:84%

and "Cleansing the Doors

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Professor Smith has taught at
MIT, Syracuse, and Berkeley.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Huston.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking
about entheogens,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
a special term meaning
god disclosing.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's a term referring to
the same sorts of chemicals

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and substances that have
sometimes been called

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.040 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic or hallucinogenic.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's hard
to have a discussion

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
about these chemicals and
their religious significance

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
without also looking at the
enormous popular movement

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
during the 1960s and 1970s that
the use of these substances

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:90%
engendered.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very true of a very
murky and complex social scene.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And that does make
it very difficult

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to try to look at
the constructive,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
the positive experience that
these substances can introduce.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.070 align:middle line:90%
You're quite right.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to separate.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Aldous Huxley called
one of his books

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
on this subject "The
Heaven and Hell" drugs.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's quite right.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And Albert Hoffman,
who discovered LSD,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.770 align:middle line:84%
wrote his account in a book
that he titled "LSD, My Problem

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Child," a very good title.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Because separating the good
from-- the wheat from the chaff

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
is extremely difficult.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I may, Huston,
inject a personal note here,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I should just say about
myself, I was a college student

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%
in the 1960s.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
I started out as a
business major, actually.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Hard for me to imagine.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I still have
business interests today.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
But I was exposed
to these entheogens

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and ingested them on numerous
occasions in my youth.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And my experiences, I
want to say looking back,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
were virtually all positive,
were virtually all benign.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And today, my interest
in human potential,

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and parapsychology,
and mysticism,

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:90%
metaphysics and spirituality--

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
it's a very serious pursuit
for me, as I'm sure all--

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:90%
>> --my listeners know.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that those
experiences in my youth

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.460 align:middle line:84%
were very important in
sort of blowing away

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
what I would call the
crust of 1950s middle class

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
mentality, in
which I was raised.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
saying that, Jeffrey.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.660 align:middle line:84%
I think in the atmosphere today,
it took some courage for you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's the truth.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the truth.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience pointed me in
the direction that I'm in now.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it's
been a long, long time

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.910 align:middle line:84%
since I've had any exposure
to those substances.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:90%
But I have no regrets.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I am right with you on that.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And, Jeffrey, as we think about
it, how many millions of people

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:84%
there may be or probably
are out there who

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
would say essentially the same.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
I'll just give my most
immediate example.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
I happen to have been
invited in New York City just

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.530 align:middle line:90%
this last Monday--

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
people-- I could not
believe the wealth.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
They had a penthouse on
top of a 40-story window.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
But they were interested
in my work, invited me,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and both of them said
essentially the same thing.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:84%
The woman in the
couple said that her

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
experience lying on a carpet
listening to Beethoven's violin

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:90%
concerto--

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:90%
it ended her fear of death.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And the man said something
like that in his own case.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So there must be
millions out there.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And one of the points
in my writing this book

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
is to try to open up the
discussion, rather than just

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
sweeping truth under a
carpet and knuckling down

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.300 align:middle line:84%
under before the hysteria
that surrounds this subject.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the early writers on
this subject are the people

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
like Aldous Huxley, Alan
Watts, Jean Houston and Robert

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Masters.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's not
forget William James.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> William James.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.430 align:middle line:84%
They associated the
use of these entheogens

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
with the great
metaphysical search

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.920 align:middle line:90%
for authentic self-awareness.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner,
and Richard Alpert wrote

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
in 1968, I believe, "The
Psychedelic Experience,"

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
in which they equated the
experience of ingesting

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
entheogens, LSD at the
time, with the experience

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.100 align:middle line:84%
of traveling through
the Bardo Plains,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.710 align:middle line:84%
as described in the
"Tibetan Book of the Dead,"

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
a profoundly
spiritual experience.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I took those writings
very seriously in my youth,

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.800 align:middle line:90%
and I still do.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, also.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
But then, it got mixed up with
the rebellion of the time.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the time
of the Vietnam War.

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And so rebellion and resistance
got mixed into the picture.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.770 align:middle line:90%
And this alarmed parents.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, with all
my personal fondness

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
for Timothy Leary, that if I
had been a parent there then

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and I heard the siren
song to my children

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:84%
that the establishment, there
was nothing good about it,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and the only way to
react was to drop out,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:90%
just cut out from society--

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
I, as a parent, would have
been alarmed by that, too.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that is
understandable, also.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But it has created
a chaotic mindset

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
towards these
substances but you and I

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:84%
are trying to shed a few slivers
of sanity in understanding.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you were a parent
at the time, as I recall.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.150 align:middle line:84%
I remember meeting
your daughter.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And I also know you've written
an essay, very critical,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:84%
about the Timothy Leary's motto,
tune in, turn on, and drop out.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:84%
But, on the other
hand, you pointed out

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that it's not so different from
what the early Christian church

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.120 align:middle line:90%
fathers were saying.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.539 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.409 align:middle line:90%
There is a parallel.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The other part of that essay
now in my book is that they--

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
so far, the parallel is
very strong, very exact.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But the early church fathers
had a positive program.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
the psychedelic movement--

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
it was negative and right
in much of its rebellion.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:16.660 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't have a positive
vision to substitute.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And we can look back
now, several decades later,

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.630 align:middle line:84%
and say while there's some
jewels in there that we

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:84%
don't want to lose, the
psychedelic movement has not

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:84%
had the kind of lasting impact
on culture that people thought

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:32.740 align:middle line:90%
it might have had.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And, certainly, nothing to
compare with the world's

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:90%
great religions.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet, as a scientist,
as a philosopher,

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
we come back to the issue of
empirical metaphysics that you

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:90%
raise.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.870 align:middle line:84%
One scholar compared
the psychedelic--

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.520 align:middle line:84%
which is the term
they used then.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You call it entheogens, to be
incomparable to a telescope

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.480 align:middle line:84%
or a microscope, only
pointed to the inner recesses

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:90%
of the human soul.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And some have, for that reason,
called these substances mind

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:90%
expanding.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's not quite
a careful use of words.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.256 align:middle line:84%
Because it's more like, I
think-- did you use the word

00:10:30.256 --> 00:10:31.056 align:middle line:90%
a microscope?

00:10:31.056 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Does a microscope
expand our awareness?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly with
regard to the cell, yes.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It expands our ability
to see the cell,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.290 align:middle line:84%
but by shutting out
everything else.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a
little bit careless

00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.640 align:middle line:84%
to say mind expanding without
introducing that qualification.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Huston, we'll
take a break now.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.284 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.840 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Professor
Emeritus Huston Smith,

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.260 align:middle line:84%
author of "Cleansing the Doors
of Perception" and "The World's

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Religions."

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
religious significance

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of entheogenic chemicals and
plants, chemicals and plants

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that help us to be
disclosed or to be

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.490 align:middle line:84%
present to the
nature of the divine.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Huston, I think we're getting
down to a very crucial point.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
distinction between living

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
an authentic, mystical,
spiritual life, and especially

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.900 align:middle line:84%
in community, as
opposed to having

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
an authentic,
spiritual experience.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad you brought
that up, Jeffrey,

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:84%
because that is
crucial, I think.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:84%
I have come to the
conclusion, and I

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.860 align:middle line:84%
did early on, within
a year or two,

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.730 align:middle line:84%
and actually conducted
some experiment

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that descriptively a
mystical experience triggered

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
by these substances are
indistinguishable from those

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that occur to the great
mystics spontaneously.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:84%
I actually did a study,
and I took samples

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
from the mystical
tradition and from

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.780 align:middle line:90%
the entheogenic experiences.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:90%
I shuffled them.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And I asked people who
were knowledgeable scholars

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.060 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical whether
they could separate them

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
into their original power.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.500 align:middle line:90%
They could not do that.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But that brings exactly
the point that you say.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
So the experiences
are indistinguishable.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:90%
That's not the point.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:90%
Experiences come and go.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The main point is
the religious life,

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:32.050 align:middle line:84%
which centers on the way in
which experiences can be worked

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.520 align:middle line:84%
into the substance
of one's being

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
so that they alter in more
benevolent, kindly ways

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
the light that follow.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
So the formula I have--

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:90%
well, it's not mine.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:90%
I think it came--

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.630 align:middle line:90%
I think Ram Dass used it first.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, when you get
the message, hang up--

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:84%
a way of saying that it's
not the experiences that

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%
are important.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And another phrase
that I like very much--

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
it's not altered states,
but altered traits.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
true point lies,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and that these can induce
wonderful cloud 9 experiences

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.580 align:middle line:90%
is all very pleasant.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But unless, as I say, you
can bring it back through--

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and this requires
prolonged practice--

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
and modulate, you
might say, your life up

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:56.110 align:middle line:84%
to what it would be if it
were lived in accord with what

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:59.530 align:middle line:90%
one experiences mystically--

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
unless that happened, why,
then it's of no consequence.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a zen phrase I've
heard that makes me think it

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.880 align:middle line:84%
might be applicable here, called
the stink of enlightenment.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Right.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Those who magnify it,
wear on their sleeve

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:30.130 align:middle line:84%
their glorious Satori
experiences, but sit around

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:90%
while others wash up the dishes.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
The zen phrase, stinking of zen,
applies to that carelessness

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and overlooking where
the real business lies.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So one might say that you
could characterize that fervor

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.360 align:middle line:84%
of the '60s and early '70s
as stinking, in that sense.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.235 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.235 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:09.190 align:middle line:90%
The zen people are very earthy.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.025 align:middle line:84%
But I like the directness and
pointedness of their statement.

00:16:13.025 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one would hope
that since we're having this

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
conversation, that there's
something worth salvaging

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:90%
in all of that.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the potential
exists in the next century

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
or two or centuries, that
a more mature lifestyle

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
can be built in
Earth culture here,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
that can include
the valuable aspects

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:84%
of the entheogenic
experience, and also

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
include the whole life
supporting and community

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:84%
building process, which
is really required.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Fervently to be hoped, yes.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
a difficult task.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:84%
The variables are
daunting in their number.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I come back to
Aldous Huxley's statement

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
that without question
note the emphasis

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that entheogenic experience is
the most important experience

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
a human being can have short
of the mystical vision.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
society that precludes

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that most important, short
of the mystic beatific vision

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
experience from its
citizens by its laws.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have that experience
without danger of going

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:90%
to jail.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I think something is
deeply, deeply wrong

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:90%
in a society set up that way.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that is not to blink
or shortchange the danger.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:90%
The dangers are there.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.960 align:middle line:84%
But, certainly, one
should hope that we

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
would have the wit and the
will to work on this problem

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and work out some
sensible solution.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Aldous Huxley,
whom you mentioned,

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
is an interesting case in
point, a great novelist.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
I was first introduced
to his works

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
through his novel "Brave
New World," sort of--

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:90%
>> --a negative utopia.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:37.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And then something
transformed him from a cynic,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.250 align:middle line:84%
which I think that book
was basically cynical and--

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It was.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --deeply disturbing to a
great metaphysical writer.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:54.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The perennial philosophy
has stood the test in time

00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
wonderfully and introduced
millions of young people

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
to the authenticity of
the mystical vision,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and more important, the
mystical way of life.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a wonderful
servant of society.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:20.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And Huxley, himself, I gather
was transformed in part by his

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:90%
experience with the entheogens.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:29.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well he certainly spoke
of it with the utmost regard.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And, as I recall, your
description of his life--

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:38.090 align:middle line:84%
he used that experience
as a springboard for--

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:84%
along with his
friend, Gerald Hurd,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
who was a big
inspiration to you.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They used that
entheogenic experience

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.300 align:middle line:84%
as a springboard for a life of
discipline, a life of inquiry,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
for not a wasteful life
but a focused life.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:02.390 align:middle line:84%
At one point when I was
in touch with them, they--

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Gerald Hurd, taking
the initiative,

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:84%
had established a
kind of monastery

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
in Trabuco Canyon, where
they were meditating four

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
hours a day, day after day.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
So talk about folding discipline
in with these substances--

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
they set the example.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And, earlier, you referred
to Ram Dass, who said,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.277 align:middle line:84%
once you've gotten the
message, hang up the phone.

00:20:34.277 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And he's an exemplar of a
person who has devoted himself

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.050 align:middle line:90%
to a life of service.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely one of the
great models for our time,

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
giving away his
fortune to the poor,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
active in so many foundations,
dedicated to human welfare.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:90%
He's an inspiration.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So it suggests that out of
that era were people who really

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.540 align:middle line:84%
got the message and did
integrate it into their life.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a whole
operation didn't.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Peter Coyote is another one.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:90%
I mean, different but--

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if you know, but--

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> He's an actor and a
social activist, I think.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And heads the California
Council on the Arts.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But his name Coyote, came
from when he was in college.

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%
He heard about these things.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.550 align:middle line:84%
He and his friend knew nothing
as to what to do with them.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.620 align:middle line:84%
But he spent one night
under the influence

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
just running through
the cornfields of Iowa,

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:90%
near Grinnell College.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And he felt himself
bonded with the coyote,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
to the point that
he changed his name.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so it does suggest that
if we look carefully at that

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.770 align:middle line:84%
generation that came
out of the 1960s--

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and I guess I include you as
a forerunner in that regard--

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that we will find many positive,
lifelong examples of how

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:84%
careers were built out
of that inspiration that

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
came from the
entheogenic experience.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are
millions out there.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
It's our climate
of hysteria that

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:39.360 align:middle line:84%
keeps people keeping
this to themselves

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:90%
and not coming forward.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:90%
But the fact is there.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.295 align:middle line:84%
>> Huston Smith, thank you
so much for coming forward,

00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:47.095 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:22:47.095 --> 00:22:47.895 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:22:47.895 --> 00:22:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> As always, it's a
joy to be with you.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all mutual,
Jeffrey, as you well know.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:90%
