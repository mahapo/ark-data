Conversations on the leading

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.690 align:middle line:84%
This is the second part of
our two-part program on aging,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.580 align:middle line:84%
change, and dying with Ram Dass,
author of "Be Here Now," "Grist

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.240 align:middle line:84%
for the Mill," "How Can I
Help?," and "Still Here."

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
A pioneer in the
area of cultural

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:84%
transformation, and has been
for many decades a forerunner.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
In recent years, Ram Dass
has suffered a stroke, which

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
has been the subject of our
conversation, and as a result,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
he experiences some aphasia
or slowness of speech.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you to listen to
this program and meditative

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
way, and if there
are pauses allow

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
yourself to enter
into the rhythm

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
and deepen your consciousness
in the conversation.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.240 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Ram Dass.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure to be with you.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.180 align:middle line:84%
In part 1, of this
two-part series,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
we talked a bit
about how you had

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.400 align:middle line:84%
the stroke and the
changes that occurred,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:90%
and we spoke of it in two ways.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
Both-- it's a very powerful,
personal story, but in a way,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
it epitomizes the aging and the
physical changes that we all

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
will face eventually, especially
people of my generation, Baby

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Boomers, who are
really just entering

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:90%
into the phase of aging.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And you were talking
about how it affects

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.740 align:middle line:84%
your identity, your
sense of who you are,

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and your memory of
who you've been.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, before the
stroke I played golf,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:10%
I played the cello, I drove my
sports cars with stick shift,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:10%
and this is sort of like--

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.480 align:middle line:10%
>> That arm is pretty limp.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I found that I'm
suffering more if I try to--

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
like if I remember myself
as a golfer or a cellist.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.850 align:middle line:90%
But if I like--

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.100 align:middle line:90%
the stroke is a new incarnation.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.525 align:middle line:84%
>> And in this one,
I've never played golf.

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And the comparison
of the past with the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:90%
now is cause for suffering.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It could be a
source of great pain.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.142 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm no longer a golfer,
I'm a person with stroke.

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And the stroke, it opened
up whole new realms for me.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I learned quietness.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.765 align:middle line:90%
I learned respect for my body.

00:03:55.765 --> 00:04:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
I learned-- see,
that's it, that like--

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:90%
that quietness.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Because you were a teacher
of meditation for many years,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
so this is a new
kind of quietness.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a forced
quietness by my brain.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:36.590 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm just quiet--

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
the-- the time my brain
stops, then I get quiet.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
At one point you wrote that
there's-- it's as if there's a

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
room in your mind where
the concepts put on clothes

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
and the clothes are like words.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.450 align:middle line:90%
That room is no longer there.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It bombed out, but
you-- it's interesting,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:18.190 align:middle line:84%
because the concepts are
there, but there are no words

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:90%
to clothe the concepts.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You're getting at I
think something crucial,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
that it faces people
as they become older,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
as they become decrepit--
maybe a sense of uselessness.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.980 align:middle line:84%
That the world seems to value
so much if you can be active,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:90%
if you can speak.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
If you're young.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- it's not the
world, it's this culture.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Because like--

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.330 --> 00:06:00.410 align:middle line:10%
I was in a small village
that I visit in India,

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:09.230 align:middle line:10%
and somebody said to me,
you're looking much older.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.412 align:middle line:10%
In this culture that
would be fighting words.

00:06:13.412 --> 00:06:14.245 align:middle line:10%
>> What do you mean?

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, what do you-- yeah.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:10%
I should have gotten a suntan
or something like that.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:10%


00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:10%
But the way he said it, he
was like complimenting me.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're a wisdom carrier,
you are somebody we can trust.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> An elder.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> An elder.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
We don't have in our culture
the same respect for elders.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.620 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why I'm so grateful
to be able to be with you now

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
as you are on television because
it happens so rarely, I think.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Television has
very few elders.

00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And they have few in
advertising and few in the rest

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.105 align:middle line:90%
of the programming.

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:26.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:27.705 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And certainly very few
interviews with people who

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:90%
experience aphasia.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:33.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:33.312 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a funny experience.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I was-- the hospital I was--

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:58.850 align:middle line:84%
one of the three hospitals,
they had a conference about me,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
and they were kind
enough to let me sit in.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:84%
And they were discussing
me as if I were my brain.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Or the stroke.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.210 align:middle line:90%
>> As the stroke, yes.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, excuse me,
but I'd like to point out

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:90%
that I am not my brain.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:37.190 align:middle line:84%
My brain is a response mechanism
for adapting to this plane.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean, I am--

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm a consciousness,
and consciousness is not

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:90%
localized in the brain.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:10%
And consciousness is heart and
not material manifestation.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:10%
>> Hmm.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:10%
>> They-- the doctors,
they treated me--

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.860 align:middle line:10%
they treated that as--

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:10%
that as psychosis.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:10%
That's unfortunate.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.110 align:middle line:84%
I said that they was
the psychotic ones,

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
but you understand that--

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand perfectly well.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream Western reality
is metaphysically ignorant.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
philosophical materialists.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But I have no question that
being with you now, I'm

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
in the presence
of a soul of being

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:90%
much greater than this body.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:09:55.073 --> 00:09:57.365 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know that's an
important part of your message.

00:09:57.365 --> 00:09:59.945 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.945 --> 00:10:01.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:09.376 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it
because you are it.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just like--

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:23.670 align:middle line:84%
we can see a soul in another
person because we have--

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:90%
a soul can see a soul.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's a resonance.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a bubbliness, an
incredible fizzy feeling just

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.805 align:middle line:90%
being in your presence.

00:10:33.805 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> A fizzy feeling?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> A fizzy feeling.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.608 align:middle line:90%
Really

00:10:36.608 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know, it's
energizing around us.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.100 align:middle line:84%
You are a great
soul, I have to say,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and an incredible inspiration to
me and have been for decades--

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
not just to me, but to
millions of the people

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
who I value most,
people who have

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.190 align:middle line:84%
who have lived with me through
some incredible periods--

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:84%
protest movements, a
psychedelic revolution,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.810 align:middle line:90%
a consciousness explosion.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
You've been out there
leading the way,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and I see this
experience as you're

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
out there still is
the pioneer, saying

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:84%
this is the next territory
we're going to conquer.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because this is a new
and frightening territory

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:90%
for most people.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Ram Dass, we'll take a break.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Fizzing Allowed."

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking with Ram Dass.

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
We're exploring aging,
change, and dying.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And let's talk about dying.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You have sat at the
deathbed of hundreds,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.210 align:middle line:90%
maybe thousands of people.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember reading in your
book "Still Here," you said,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.150 align:middle line:84%
you regretted it, it took you
until the age of 29 before you

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.190 align:middle line:90%
actually witnessed a death.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.030 align:middle line:90%
But I can attest--

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very interested in
death and dying, and I'm 53

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:84%
and I have yet to be in
the presence of death.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Being present at death and
being present at birth are--

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:10%


00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.900 align:middle line:10%
they're-- they're
change experiences.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.090 align:middle line:10%
>> That's where you come
to the mystery right there.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, I attended one
birth in my life, but--

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Yours?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.330 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.716 align:middle line:90%
I mean one other.

00:12:40.716 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] One other
birth, a young man

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.410 align:middle line:90%
who I am his godfather.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> But now let's focus on
death, on death's some more.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's the ultimate mystery
that we all have to confront.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose for
many people, it's

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.810 align:middle line:84%
not death itself
that's so frightening,

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
but the process that
leads up to death.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The stroke may be
an example of that.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:11.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:15.170 align:middle line:90%
So much frightening like pain.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Pain.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And uncertainty.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And change that goes along
with the change in death.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:40.330 align:middle line:84%
People bring their
fears about death--

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
there are three
fears that I know.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
The before death
and then the death

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:84%
moment and what
comes after death.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And the first one is
they're afraid of pain

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and the uncertainty.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.062 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.452 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the one that's--

00:14:25.452 --> 00:14:42.940 align:middle line:90%
that's the-- the ego has--

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
the ego has-- ultimate loss--

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:90%
the--

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It must be very embarrassing
to the ego to be going through

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:56.660 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And-- but the soul doesn't
have anything to do with death.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:17.525 align:middle line:84%
He is-- the soul looks
like saying, he's dying.

00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Never I'm dying.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's very-- to go into the
death process with your soul,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
identifying with your soul.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.965 align:middle line:90%
>> They become the onlooker.

00:15:43.965 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Just like I was the
onlooker for the stroke.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> During the stroke, yeah.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Well you talk about, if I
understand it correctly,

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:90%
pure awareness.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.230 align:middle line:84%
You write about it
with a capital A--

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> --as being even a
deeper level than the soul.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:03.495 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:10%
If we try to find we
have so many I's--

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:10%
and I do this, I, I,
the I of the ego--

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:10%
I'm in television.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm I. Then we have
the I of the soul.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.525 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.525 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
As the soul split off from
God, to just take a moment

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
to take an incarnation.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:09.559 align:middle line:84%
And because the incarnation
lessons to learn.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:90%


00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And the soul has
only one motive,

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and that motive is
melding with the beloved,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.955 align:middle line:90%
melding with the one.

00:17:33.955 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.230 align:middle line:90%
The soul was split off--

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:48.810 align:middle line:84%
split off from the one, and
that's all they want to get.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It's like Rumi.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Love like that.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:90%
And the soul gets incarnations--

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
a step with-- a step
up towards the one.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Then besides those
two, ego and soul,

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
we have the Atman,
which is the god in us.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
that's an abstraction,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:90%
but we experience it--

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:90%
we feel it as awareness.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Like I am aware of what
comes in through my ears.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:84%
I come aware of different
parts of my body.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sensory motor system.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now-- but that awareness,
when you try to-- you

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.810 align:middle line:90%
can't objectify, that--

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.070 align:middle line:90%
that is always subjective.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can never study
the awareness inside.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It's like--

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:10%
>> But that movement,
that movement,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:59.310 align:middle line:10%
it makes me think of what
you said of the soul wanting

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:10%
to return.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.928 align:middle line:10%
And as you were speaking,
I had this strong sense

00:20:02.928 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't want to just
return, because that's where it

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:10%
came from in the first place.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:10%
It's as if it wants to reach
and touch and feel and love

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.790 align:middle line:10%
and bring all of
that back with it.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.524 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, it wants that-- ahh.

00:20:15.524 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's the--

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:10%


00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:10%
it's like-- it's like
the orgasm with God.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.660 align:middle line:10%
And that-- you can--

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:10%
you can feel it
before it happens.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:10%
That's-- well, that's
the word ecstasy.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:20:45.384 --> 00:20:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:58.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not-- it's not a thing.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.075 align:middle line:90%
It is-- it's-- oh God.

00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:05.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> This would be difficult
under the best of circumstances

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
to describe, but we're talking
about the moment of death,

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think there is a sense
in which the fulfillment

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
of one's life at death
could be like that.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:10%
>> It's just that.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:10%
I think the best description
of the moment of death

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:10%
is LSD session.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.770 align:middle line:10%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:37.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Because you've
got no control,

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:47.815 align:middle line:10%
you've got wide open space.

00:21:47.815 --> 00:21:53.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.190 align:middle line:84%
What you were before
is nothing like--

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.596 align:middle line:90%
nothing like--

00:22:00.596 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Who you are at that--

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Who-- who's-- yeah.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.500 align:middle line:90%
And the moment is just change--
