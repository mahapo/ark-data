>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to
explore the wellspring

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%

I'm pleased to be with Dr. Jean
Shinoda Bolen, Jungian analyst,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.190 align:middle line:84%
member of the
Department of Psychiatry

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:84%
at the University of California
Medical School in San

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
Francisco, and author of
a number of classic books,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:84%
including "Goddesses in
Everywoman," "Gods in Everyman"

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.310 align:middle line:84%

"Crossing to Avalon,"

"Close to the Bone,"
and "The Ring of Power."

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jean.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I think
of esoteric culture,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the mystery traditions around
the world, authentic mysticism,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
over and over again
it actually strikes me

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that all mystical traditions
are about feminine spirituality,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
about preserving something
that has been lost

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in the patriarchal culture.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I would agree that it's
about the experience itself.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So it's not about having a
book or a transcendent god

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.870 align:middle line:10%
speaking from above or
giving the message to someone

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.400 align:middle line:10%
who passes it on.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:10%
It's non-hierarchical.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:10%
And it isn't about words.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:10%
So consequently, anything
that is a mystery

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:10%
is a mystical experience.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
It is an experience that you
know intuitively in your heart,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:90%
in your soul.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:90%
And you have it.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
You can't take it and
make somebody else believe

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.450 align:middle line:84%
in it, not that you're
even inclined to do so.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So in that way, it's
a more feminine model

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
of being receptive to the
mystical, spiritual experience,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
feeling it in your body soul,
and then having an experience

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.600 align:middle line:90%
that changes you.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's an experience
that I felt that,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
personal, that you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.560 align:middle line:84%
have to have some
way of describing it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.640 align:middle line:90%
through your own life.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote "Crossing to Avalon"
as a story of my own midlife

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:90%
pilgrimage.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
But it was far more
than a personal story.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It was really the
vehicle in order

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.970 align:middle line:84%
to describe what it is that I
had discovered along the way

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.480 align:middle line:84%
and put into words
of women's often

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:90%
mystical spiritual experiences.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're in a
traditional society where

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
religion owns all the words,
all the spiritual words

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.380 align:middle line:84%
like "sacramental,"
like "grace,"

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
then you can have an experience
that is enormously sacramental,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
but it isn't in any kind
of official experience.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens if
you have an experience

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
words for it is it

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:84%
goes back into the
psyche, forgotten.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things, if
you go out on a pilgrimage,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:84%
is that as you go
towards this place,

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.290 align:middle line:84%
you also go in and start
to think about and remember

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:90%
experiences you've had.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So I was invited to
go on a pilgrimage

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
to visit my own spiritual
sources, is what it began as.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an interesting
term, "sources."

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea turned out
to be very interesting,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't realize--

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
since I was at the
start of my 49th year

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
and also my profession
as a Jungian an analyst,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm not in my body
very much in my work.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my intuition.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I might say I'm in my
feelings and in my mind,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.790 align:middle line:84%
but that I actually might pick
up information, especially

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.090 align:middle line:84%
spiritual experience,
through my body

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and then remember that lots
of other previous experiences

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
fit that description
also is what I

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:90%
did with "Crossing to Avalon."

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I didn't
realize that people

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
had been going on pilgrimages
for thousands of years

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.730 align:middle line:90%
to quicken their divinity.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And once I got a sense of
those particular words,

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.800 align:middle line:84%
it really struck me that I know
what those words are about.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Quicken the divinity.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Quicken the divinity.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Because as a pregnant woman,
I knew that I was pregnant.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.510 align:middle line:90%
Test said I was.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I was tired.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Body was changing.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And what a difference
it was when

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.420 align:middle line:84%
I felt movement of new
life, my baby moving in me.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That is how we use the
word "quicken," you see.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean if you use
it about quicken the divinity?

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Why would you go to
places of pilgrimage

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:90%
to quicken the divinity?

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.080 align:middle line:90%
What might that mean?

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.020 align:middle line:90%
That was the mystery.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
So then I go to
Chartres Cathedral,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and I go through the
Cathedral the first time

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
like a sightseer, art
history student, appreciator

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.720 align:middle line:90%
of all the beauty around me.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Much to see.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Much to see.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, because I
remember that there was a--

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
this was a Black Madonna site
before it was a Christian site,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a well
somewhere at this site.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And I gathered that it was in
the crypt of this cathedral.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So I had an opportunity to go
on a sort of unofficial tour

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
down into the crypt with a
guide who didn't speak English.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.770 align:middle line:84%
So here again, we're making
a descent, basically.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:90%
Lighting is dim.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm in an unusual
place, an unusual land.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is talking to
me in a foreign language.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Under this huge cathedral.

00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Under this huge
cathedral, right.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.040 align:middle line:90%
And something is shifting in me.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think it has to do with
moving out of the left brain,

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
out of that mind that is
educated and therefore has

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
this view of things, into
the perceptive mind that

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.730 align:middle line:90%
has her own experience.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So I do this, and then I
come up to the Cathedral.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's
like inner and outer

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
often happen together, that
when I'm deeply moved inside,

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.590 align:middle line:84%
some synchronicity on the
outside happens to enhance it.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So this time when I come
up in the Cathedral,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:84%
it's like the organist
begins to play.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
So I have background
music to this.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.100 align:middle line:84%
And now I don't
have to sight see

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:90%
because I've seen that place.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm feeling is
that there's energy here

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.940 align:middle line:90%
that I'm picking up in my body.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm just
moving to the church,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
to where the energy
is the greatest.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.510 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that I
have in my body what

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:10%
could be like a tuning
fork to the energy.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:10%
And where the transepts
cross the nave,

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.930 align:middle line:10%
that was where the
energy in front of-- it

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.040 align:middle line:10%
was in front of the altar.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.930 align:middle line:84%
That was the energy was
the greatest for me.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood
there and just was

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
receptive to what was
coming into my mind,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I realized that if I were
as large as this Cathedral,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
like this, where
the labyrinth was--

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
is would be where my
uterus or womb is.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And isn't this-- and this whole
sense of this feminine space

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that I was in began
to make me realize

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
that this might be something
about the quickening

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.130 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
That is, you feel
something in your body.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is involved with
the energy of the place.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.870 align:middle line:84%
So might we truly all
be spiritual beings

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:90%
on this human path, our souls?

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Might we be moved to go on
pilgrimage, to go to places

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:90%
where they said divinity lived?

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.780 align:middle line:84%
But what happens there is that
you become aware that it's

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:90%
been in you all the time.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
>> If I understand the
chronology correctly,

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:84%
by the time you had gone on this
pilgrimage, you were already,

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I dare say, a
world-famous author.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Your book "Goddesses in
Everywoman" was a best-seller.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it was.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And you now here in
the heart of a cathedral

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and in the underground
grotto, the cave,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.710 align:middle line:84%
ancient cave and wellspring
under that cathedral,

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
something was
awakened within you,

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.120 align:middle line:84%
perhaps something about which
you had been writing for years,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.850 align:middle line:84%
but now you were
experiencing in a new way.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I certainly was
experiencing something in a new

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.262 align:middle line:84%
way, but it wasn't what
I was writing about.

00:09:22.262 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when I was writing
"Goddesses in Everywoman,"

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I was writing about
the archetypes,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the psychological
archetypes in women.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
What was interesting is
it became a beginning text

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.668 align:middle line:84%
for a grassroots women's
spirituality movement.

00:09:36.668 --> 00:09:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's because when you
get into the archetypal level

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.690 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche and when
you touch into symbols,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.200 align:middle line:84%
you are entering the
mystery of the deepening

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:90%
of your experience.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So a symbol becomes
imbued with meaning,

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and therefore it becomes a
spiritual kind of experience.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that was happening.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:10%
But when I went
on this pilgrimage

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:10%
and was affected by
the energy of the place

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:10%
and began to remember
from an embodied place,

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.350 align:middle line:10%
I started to have a
different concept about how

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.100 align:middle line:10%
women's spirituality is a
spirituality in which you are

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:10%
bringing back what could
be called the Goddess

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:10%
or a spirituality
that is of the body,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.720 align:middle line:10%
in which sacred
experience is felt

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.990 align:middle line:10%
in relationship to the Earth.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:10%
And this is true
of lot of people,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:10%
that they have their
most sacramental moments

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:10%
sometimes out under the stars,
out in nature, men and women.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:38.130 align:middle line:10%
But then, what it
also reminded me

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.850 align:middle line:10%
was of the experiences
of bearing a child

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:10%
and how that was one of the
deepest spiritual experiences,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.695 align:middle line:10%
and yet because it
wasn't defined as such.

00:10:49.695 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Women have had babies forever.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was a doctor
who delivered babies

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
before I had this
experience of having

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:90%
one, which was very different.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.590 align:middle line:84%
But I had thought of myself as
an exception until this point.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean, we'll be
taking a brief break.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.950 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back in
just a few moments.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.615 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:15.531 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.180 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the wellspring

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
of women's spirituality
with Dr. Jean Shinoda

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Bolen, author of
"Crossing to Avalon"

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and "Goddesses in Everywoman."

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
If I understand correctly
what you're saying,

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Jean, that you came
to the realization

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that the goddess is more than
an archetype, but an energy.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.920 align:middle line:10%
And even more than an
energy, the goddess

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:10%
is the living experience
of billions of women.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:10%
>> And men too, because I
began to realize that in my own

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:10%
spiritual journey, I did know
what transcendent divinity was

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:10%
like because my
childhood was Christian.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And there really was a
true sense of transcendence

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:90%
and connection.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You were a devout Christian
as a child, I gather.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, no.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, at last you wrote about
it as if there were moments.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> No, but there was
definite moments.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.380 align:middle line:84%
My life really changed
when I was an adolescent

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and went to a very
Christian summer camp

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and had a life-changing interior
experience that sent me out

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to be a doctor because I felt
such a sense of gratitude

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
for everything I
had, and that one way

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.010 align:middle line:84%
I could show it or repay it,
which I never could really,

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:90%
was to serve other people.

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I did have this
adolescent idealistic notion

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.897 align:middle line:84%
that came out of the spiritual
experience of service.

00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:57.980 align:middle line:90%
>> In a Christian country.

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> In a very Christian context.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And I followed it, and
it has meant a lot to me.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But now I was adding this
whole other dimension.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just--

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.510 align:middle line:84%
it isn't just saying that
we'll change the name from god

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
to goddess.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
It was a whole
different experience,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
because there is a
god of spirituality

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.590 align:middle line:84%
or a feminine mystery or
an embodied sacred that

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is about the divine that
is in the material world.

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the beauty
that we experience there,

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
the sense of being held
in an energy field,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:43.670 align:middle line:84%
but through and within
something that is material.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And it is a mystery,
in a sense that mystery

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.390 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
word "mystes," that

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
was the name of the
people who were initiated

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:90%
into the Eleusinian mysteries.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, yeah,
there was something

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
about learning
directly that there's

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
this realm of the sacred
that is of goddess or is

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of women's spirituality
or essentially

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
is one of the mystical
ways of things.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I may be concrete,
and to follow up on what you

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.980 align:middle line:84%
said earlier, a
woman gives birth.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:90%
A woman nurses.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:90%
A woman menstruates.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
A woman is penetrated
in the sexual act.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are unique
to the physical experience

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.770 align:middle line:90%
of women.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And as you write
about them, I come

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:84%
to see that they and the
emotions that accompany them

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:90%
are awesomely profound.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> They can be.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
really is significant

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
is that they're all very
physical experiences that

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
can be oppressive, can be
terrible under terrible

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:90%
circumstances, and they can be.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But they have a possibility
of being extraordinarily

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
sacred under another
set of circumstances

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:84%
in which the soul of the
woman is in the experience

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.520 align:middle line:84%
and is picking up not
just on the physical side

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:18.590 align:middle line:84%
but on the whole sacred
experience of being

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:84%
like the goddess
who is giving birth,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
is nursing, is making love, is
holding, is being the mother.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The epitome of
nurturing, I think.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The epitome of
being human about it,

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
because there is
something about how,

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
when you want to be comforted,
it does matter that the person

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is in a body comforting
you, for example.

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And what if, besides the
body that is comforting you,

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.570 align:middle line:84%
it is within an energy field
as well that is of the goddess?

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's something
of what I was describing

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.810 align:middle line:90%
in "Crossing to Avalon."

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the title comes from a
book called "Mists of Avalon."

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I was inspired by
"Mists of Avalon,"

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
the idea that you can cross
the mists from Glastonbury

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:90%
to Avalon.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Glastonbury is a real place
in England that I went to

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and described in
"Crossing to Avalon."

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the mythical site
where you could call a barge

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and go through the mist
to another reality, which

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.750 align:middle line:84%
was Avalon, where
Glastonbury and Avalon are

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
two aspects of the same
but different realities.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Avalon being
the mythical realm,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:90%
the Kairotic timeless realm.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is that Kairos
versus Chronos, linear time,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.590 align:middle line:84%
logical, rational
world, mental world,

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:55.200 align:middle line:84%
and the devalued feminine,
Kairos, timeless.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Eternal.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Eternal.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Odd that we should
devalue eternity.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But to me, this is a key to
the idea of women's mysteries.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Or-- well, it's
human mystery.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It's when the two
worlds overlap,

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.839 align:middle line:84%
where the invisible world
and the visible world

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
somehow become one, or
the archetypal world

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and the ordinary
world cross over.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
And you're in this
liminal threshold

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:84%
place, where you are in this
world, human being, woman--

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
say, giving birth-- and
you are at that moment

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.150 align:middle line:84%
aware that there's this other
energy, reality, archetype,

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.695 align:middle line:84%
goddess, whatever
you want to name it,

00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
of which you are
participating in that moment,

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and that you are in
that moment tuning in,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.280 align:middle line:84%
touching in to a
embodied mystery.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And there is a sense when
you refer to the goddess,

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:90%
if I'm correct--

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and I think I've experienced
this once or twice--

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.680 align:middle line:90%
a sense of being embraced.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Or being-- there's something
about awe and wonder.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
The word numinous describes
all of our experiences

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
where we are touched
by something.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And the word "ineffable" is
usually attached to them,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.820 align:middle line:84%
so we aren't doing
very well with words.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> But there is that place where
something that is material,

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
that is, not invisible,
spiritual like patriarchal

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:84%
monotheism says everything
that matters usually is,

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.470 align:middle line:90%
and we are deeply moved by it.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a
very male experience

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.710 align:middle line:84%
of being an astronaut looking
at Earth from outer space

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
and seeing the
beauty of the planet

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and realizing in the
heart, this is mother,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
and that we are all
indigenous here.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.310 align:middle line:90%
Something changes us.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.930 align:middle line:90%
It's the same experience.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But we shift from just
being in the left brain

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to some liminal
space between the two

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:84%
and picking up on
another dimension.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And if people learn to trust
their own spiritual experiences

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and not look to other people
to define whether it qualifies

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
or not, then the
world is remarkably

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:90%
filled with sacred moments.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In your pilgrimage that
you wrote about in "Crossing

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to Avalon," there were many
moments when you had intimate

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.810 align:middle line:84%
conversations with other women
who were accompanying you.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And you also recall memories
of times in your life

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
where you felt, if I
understand it correctly,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.010 align:middle line:84%
that in the presence
of another woman

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.040 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility,
for both men and women,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:84%
of a greater kind of intimacy,
a being heard, being understood

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
more than in either male-female
or male-male relationships,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:90%
typically.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think that there is
something about when you are

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.350 align:middle line:10%
with your opposites.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.350 align:middle line:90%
There is an element of union.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:10%
When you're with-- when it's two
women, that there's something

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.610 align:middle line:10%
about reunion, because it's
back to a mother-child dyad

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:10%
that is different than the
meeting with one's opposite.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:19.110 align:middle line:84%
And so they're different
experiences is all I'm saying,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
a quality that is

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:28.350 align:middle line:84%
different between union and
reunion in the energy field.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about how
you validate and find yourself

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
if you are open to speak of what
you truly experience and you

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.310 align:middle line:84%
hear someone or you
hear someone telling

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:90%
of her deep personal experience.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.260 align:middle line:10%
And it touches you
because you know

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:10%
you've had the same experience.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:10%
There's a way that I think
that women as a gender

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:10%
seem to have more ability to
have inter-permeating psyches.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:10%
I truly have this
sense that it's so.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.980 align:middle line:10%
And so if women are
in a circle and are

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.410 align:middle line:10%
talking about their
own experiences,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.060 align:middle line:10%
they're talking
about themselves.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But invariably, this
sets up a resonance

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.120 align:middle line:84%
in the other women who are
hearing or opening them

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility
of that space.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is like taking--

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
all the archetypes
are in all of us.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And if we are in a
circle where they

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:90%
are being spoken of deeply--

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.060 align:middle line:84%
not from the head, but from
living, having lived there--

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
that it stirs it
in the listener.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
about that experience

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:90%
that women seem to do.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm also under the impression
that this is true of many

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.540 align:middle line:84%
groups of people who have
become repressed, suppressed,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
alienated from mainstream,
conventional, white, male,

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
patriarchal society, that
Latinos and Blacks and other

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.470 align:middle line:84%
cultures have that same
quality and the same openness

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.320 align:middle line:90%
to psychic depths.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the non-hierarchical,
top of the heap--

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the people that are not at
the top of the heap, people

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.447 align:middle line:84%
of color, indigenous
people, for one thing,

00:22:14.447 --> 00:22:15.780 align:middle line:90%
they're typically more embodied.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.906 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.906 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's changing
in our culture.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Our younger generation
listens to music and dances.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's something about
the ecstatic experience that

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:84%
informs you about
a dimension that

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is in this realm that could be
called goddess spirituality.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't-- because the realm
of goddess spirituality is not

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
just the realm that women have,
because women experience god,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:90%
and women experience goddess.

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And men experience god
and goddess as well.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean, I think we'll
end on that note.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's been such a pleasure
and a heartfelt experience

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
for me to share
this time with you.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:90%
Time went so fast.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
