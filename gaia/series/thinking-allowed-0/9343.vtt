00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
the path of the Shaman

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:90%
and Healer.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr.
Alberto Villoldo who

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
is the founder and director
of The Four Winds Society.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
He is also author
of numerous books,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530 align:middle line:84%
including "Shaman,
Healer, Sage,"

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and "Dance of the Four Winds,"
as well as "Realms of Healing."

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.673 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Alberto.

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.423 align:middle line:90%
Good to be with you.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that you
point out with regard to healing

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
is that many people will take
a series of weekend courses,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:84%
or programs, on energy
healing, energy medicine

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and come to the work
with the approach

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that they're healing
with love and compassion.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And they may not appreciate
that sometimes healing

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:90%
can have negative consequences.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:90%
You have to be very careful.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You're dealing with very
powerful energies here, Jeff.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I differentiate in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
"Shaman, Healer, Sage"
is the difference

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.470 align:middle line:90%
between healing and curing--

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.960 align:middle line:84%
that we're in the
business of healing.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are in the
business of curing.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, tremendous
cures happen

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.900 align:middle line:84%
from healing where you
access a state of wellness,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
where you experience infinity
and communion with all of life.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Very frequently, it results
in extraordinary cures,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're in the
business of healing.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:84%
I've had many people
come into my office who

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
have been to an energy healer
to have healing on their tumor.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And they've had laying
on of hands, or energy

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
sent to the tumor, only to have
it spread throughout the body.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Just the opposite of
what should have happened.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.070 align:middle line:90%
Because cancer loves energy.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It loves energy like
it loves blood flow.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And, for example, when you're
healing bone, a fracture--

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:90%
my mother at 78 broke her leg--

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:84%
when you're doing
bone healing, you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
want cell division to increase
very rapidly for bone to regrow

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.613 align:middle line:90%
and bond together again.

00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
When you're working
with a cancer,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.560 align:middle line:90%
you want the opposite process.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
You want cell division to slow
down or to stop altogether.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, many healers would
say that they don't concern

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
themselves with these
physiological issues.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
They pray to God and ask for
what is best for the patient.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, sure.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And imagine if your brain
surgeon did that, too.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that that's, oftentimes,
a lack of responsibility

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
on the healer's part
because they are still

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
healing the illness, which is a
very Western model of healing.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:90%
It's allopathic medicine.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Instead of giving 10
milligrams of medication,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.065 align:middle line:84%
we're doing 10
minutes of energy.

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:84%
In our healing
practices that I speak

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
about in "Shaman, Healer,
Sage," we do systemic healing--

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
not symptomatic, but
in the whole system.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.350 align:middle line:84%
So we help disinhibit
the immune response

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.770 align:middle line:84%
so that the person's body comes
back into health very quickly.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
point out is that many times

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.930 align:middle line:84%
in a conventional society
terrible things happen to each

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.720 align:middle line:90%
other in the name of love.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And, similarly, people who
are drawn to be healers and may

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
be motivated by what they
think is love and compassion--

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that love is what got
them into their last disastrous

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.980 align:middle line:84%
marriage, too, or not into
having children that they do

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:90%
not communicate with.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:84%
So, for the Shaman, love is
something that you must purify.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Even if we go to
our Christian roots,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.390 align:middle line:84%
we find that the
love of God goes

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.190 align:middle line:84%
through a process of
purification, of alchemy,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
before it becomes a
vessel capable of holding

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:90%
that pure love of creation.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
For the Shaman,
it's the same thing.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So to use the excuse that "God
will take care of the details.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to worry about it"
can result in a lot of damage--

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
tremendous amount of damage--
because energy organizes

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
matter in the same way that
the energy fields of a magnet

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:84%
will organize iron
filings on top of it.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring new
energy into a system,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:90%
you're reorganizing the body.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, these
techniques are indeed very

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:90%
powerful.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But what you see are
people using them

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.695 align:middle line:84%
in our culture who haven't
had adequate training.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And, in effect
for the Shaman,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.220 align:middle line:84%
this would be sorcery
or black magic.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though it may
be well-intentioned.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> With the best
intentions, of course--

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:90%
with the best intentions.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that we have to be

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
very cautious of in the
West because there is

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
such a rampant abuse of power.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.195 align:middle line:84%
And we have individuals
who are very psychically

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:90%
opened but very poorly trained.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like being born
with a musical talent

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.850 align:middle line:84%
but not developing that--
not learning the scales

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and learning to play the piano.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.202 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
greatest harm can come.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't hear of people
being harmed too much by bad

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:90%
musicians.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we don't.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly don't have any
research about the healers that

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
are not properly trained,
but I see them in my office.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:90%
I see their patients.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was an
interesting study I'm aware

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of, Dr. Bernard Grad did
at McGill University.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
He called it the
"brown thumb" effect,

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
in which he asked
people who were

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.020 align:middle line:84%
in-patients at a
psychiatric unit

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.060 align:middle line:90%
to do some healing on plants.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.560 align:middle line:90%
These are depressed people.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.640 align:middle line:90%
And the plants got worse.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, in
"Shaman, Healer, Sage,"

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
what I've sought to do is
to translate an ancient

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
methodology, a 100,000-year-old
methodology of the Americas

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of our people, into
contemporary healing methods.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.120 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a
synthesis of your own.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a synthesis of
my last 25 years in the field

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.970 align:middle line:84%
but of a discipline that goes
back 5,000 years in the oral

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:90%
tradition and earlier.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to come back to this
point because I have heard

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and, in previous interviews,
talked to people about

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.720 align:middle line:90%
the Andean priesthood.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
And they would say, well, it's
a 10,000-year-old tradition.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Your understanding is that
it's 100,000 years old.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And, if I recall
correctly, it actually

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:84%
goes back to before
modern biological humans.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the tradition is--

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.390 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
archaeological record, which

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
is changing all the
time, by the way,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
there were recent
discoveries of pyramids

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
north of Lima, the
capital of Peru,

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that date the Americas'
civilizations pyramid builders,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
1,500 years earlier
than we thought--

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I recall reading about that.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the same time that
that the pyramids in Egypt were

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.720 align:middle line:84%
being built. But the oral
tradition speaks about

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of time itself--

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.170 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of time.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:90%
Now, when does time begin?

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And, if you look at the
Christian literature

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
of 200 years ago, time
began 6,000 years ago.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
The oral tradition is
historic but not historical.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So the archaeological
record tells us

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that the earliest Americans
are probably 30,000 years old.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But they migrated from
China, from Tibet, from Asia.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can still track the oral
tradition before you arrived--

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
before you crossed the land
bridge into the Americas.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And they brought with
them healing practices--

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
their luminous
healing practices--

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.420 align:middle line:84%
where they speak about fixing
things before they're born,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
about clearing imprints in
the luminous energy field--

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:90%
in this aura--

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.410 align:middle line:84%
that surrounds the
physical body before it

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.710 align:middle line:84%
has a chance to organize
illness in the physical body.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this information that
you're imparting came to you

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
through your teachers in Peru.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
Other writers who have claimed
to have studied with Shamans

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.010 align:middle line:84%
haven't been as
explicit as you have

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
been about who
these teachers are

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and how their teachings can
be independently verified.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's
essential in this work.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.880 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the
problems with Carlos'--

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Carlos Castaneda whose book
sold millions has been largely

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.280 align:middle line:90%
debunked by scholars.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Where you can't-- he doesn't
tell you where his teachers are

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.950 align:middle line:90%
or where they live.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:90%
No one knows them but him.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to have this knowledge be

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:10.570 align:middle line:84%
independently verifiable, which
is why I chronicle and speak

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.300 align:middle line:84%
about my mentors
and my teachers.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And other researchers have gone
and drawn their own conclusions

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.423 align:middle line:90%
about these healing practices.

00:09:19.423 --> 00:09:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the
important things, I think,

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
about the training that you
experienced with them was that

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.210 align:middle line:84%
they didn't just impart
to you information.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:33.760 align:middle line:84%
They took you through processes
that literally changed your--

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:84%
it would be superficial
for me to say

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
changed your personality.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it did that in
the process, as well.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And it healed-- it healed me,
as well in some very deep ways.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
tradition, Jeff, that

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
says that there's a
difference between information

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.220 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.140 align:middle line:84%
That information is
what we cultivate,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:90%
we harvest in the West.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is what
the Shaman seeks.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Information is knowing
that water is H2O.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is being
able to make it rain.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Information is being
able to diagnose disease.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is being able to
heal it-- not only to name it,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:90%
but to heal it.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people today are aware
of what the Hindus called

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
the chakras, luminous centers
of whirling energy associated,

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, with different glands
or different parts of the body.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And you found a very similar
teaching to that in the Andes.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, our students
in our Light Body training--

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
because what I'm doing now is
dedicating myself to training

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:90%
Western Shamans--

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
they say to me, Alberto, I
thought the chakras were Hindu.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I look at them
and I ask them,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I thought the kidneys
were European.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.480 align:middle line:84%
If it's part of our luminous
nature, it's universal.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Alberto, we're going
to take a short break.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Dr.
Alberto Villoldo, author

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:90%
of "Shaman, Healer, Sage."

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And, just before our break, we
were talking about the chakras

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and how we might associate
them with the Hindu culture.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But you're suggesting
that they have

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.060 align:middle line:84%
what we could call
philosophically

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
an ontological reality.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely, they certainly do.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're called
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:90%
in Spanish, "eyes of light."

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And let me describe
the chakras to you

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
because they're an important
part of our energy anatomy,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:90%
of our luminous anatomy.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The chakras are spinning
vortexes of energy

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.910 align:middle line:90%
that are funnel-shaped.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And the mouth of the funnel
rests about two inches outside

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And the narrow end of the
funnel goes into the body

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and connects directly
with the spinal cord.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
So it informs our
neurophysiology

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:90%
directly and immediately.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And it organizes our
physical, our psychological,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.160 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual reality.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is something that
you yourself have seen and have

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:90%
shared--

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.185 align:middle line:90%
>> I have experience.

00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And we train our
students in learning

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the luminous
systems of the body.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
meridians of acupuncture

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
are called "rivers of light"
in the Shamanic traditions.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
first time that I

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
saw a medicine man working
on a woman who had asthma.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And he was working on the
exact acupuncture points

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:90%
that you use to treat asthma.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I say to him,
you know acupuncture?

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:90%
And he says, acupuncture?

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.460 align:middle line:84%
He says, well, it's an
ancient tradition from China.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, China?

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:90%
And he says, no, no.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother taught me to
see these "rivers of light"

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
that flow down along the
skin through the body.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And whenever the
light is blocked,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.420 align:middle line:84%
I stimulate it until the
light flows freely again.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, you have a
fascinating story about how

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.618 align:middle line:90%
this fellow took lipstick.

00:12:57.618 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I couldn't believe it.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, my training
has been scientific.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:90%
So I said, show me.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:84%
So he had me take all my
clothing off down to my shorts,

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.635 align:middle line:84%
and we found his
wife's lipstick--

00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:84%
this is her only
lipstick, which is

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:90%
what got us in trouble later.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And he drew these
meridians on my body,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and they coincided
perfectly with the meridians

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese medicine.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And, even today, the most
brilliant acupuncturists

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:90%
in Japan are blind.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
deceived by sight.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.940 align:middle line:84%
But these are universal
structures, Jeff.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And you use the term
perceive, rather than see.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
perceive with the inner eye.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we perceive with the
inner eye and not with these

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:84%
eyes that are so limited that
are in the service of ordinary

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And, yet, it's not--
what you're saying,

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not imagination, that
there's something objective

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
that we can perceive here with
the inner eye from culture

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
to culture will be described
with a certain amount

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.210 align:middle line:90%
of precision.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the same
references are--

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.968 align:middle line:84%
you find them in the
Maoris in New Zealand.

00:13:59.968 --> 00:14:01.385 align:middle line:84%
You find them among
the Buddhists.

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists depicted
with this aura of light

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.270 align:middle line:84%
around him, the Christ with
a halo of the apostles.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, was this halo
around Christ a metaphor

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
for some inner state?

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And, in the West,
what we have taken

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:84%
the liberty of doing
is reinterpreting what,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
in every other tradition around
the world, is an experience,

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
a literal perceivable
experience.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a source
of major debate, I think,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.530 align:middle line:84%
amongst scholars
of mysticism today.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're taking a
side in this debate.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I have taken a side--

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:84%
I took a side 20 years ago
when I threw my recorder

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.480 align:middle line:84%
and notepad into the
fire and realized

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that I had to experience
the training of the Shaman

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and not just take
notes about it.

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And today, we train our students
in our healing, the Light Body

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.980 align:middle line:84%
School, we're training
physicians, and nurses,

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:57.910 align:middle line:84%
and social workers,
and laypeople,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and carpenters to perceive
the luminous energy field

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and to become a healing
influence in the world.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
remarkable training.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say
you're training people

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.180 align:middle line:90%
in a form of illusion.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And they certainly
might say that.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- they're
entitled to their opinion.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.880 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing
is the results here--

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:90%
is the results.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:29.320 align:middle line:84%
See, the Shaman describes
four levels of engagement

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.868 align:middle line:90%
with reality.

00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And I want to describe
them briefly to you.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The first one is the
body or the literal--

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:90%
the physical level.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And these are like these
Russian nesting dolls

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that enfold each other and
inform the ones within them.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
So the body--

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> The physical body.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
>> --physical body
or physical reality,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.790 align:middle line:84%
the mind that creates
our reality, the soul,

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
if you would, or the
level of the mythic--

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
the mythological-- and
then the essential level,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.740 align:middle line:90%
the level of spirit.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Each of these informing
the ones above.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.350 align:middle line:84%
What the Shaman can do and what
we train our students to do

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
is that, if you have a pending
engagement with a heart

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
condition because
your mother may

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
have had heart disease
or your grandmother

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.780 align:middle line:84%
had heart disease,
that you don't

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:90%
want to do it at the literal.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>> The level of the body.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> The level of the body.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Preferably, you'll do it
at the level of the mind

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
where the mind can create
health in the body, not

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
only psychosomatic disease,
but psychosomatic health.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.700 align:middle line:84%
Or, even better, at
the level of the soul.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But, better even, at
the level of spirit

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
where we can clear
the blueprint that

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
organizes the
physical body-- this

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
luminous energy field that
organizes the physical body--

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and that has the
blueprints of illness

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%
and of health within it.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you describe-- and
I like your definition very

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:53.210 align:middle line:84%
much-- that the soul is finite,
but the spirit is infinite.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:84%
The soul is personal, and
it's the business of religion

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:90%
where you can save your soul.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I may choose
not to save mine.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:90%
The spirit is one.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely one.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:84%
My mentor-- let me describe
these four levels again--

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.920 align:middle line:84%
my mentor would
say to me, Alberto,

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
you've spent 95% of your energy
decorating and redecorating

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:90%
your psyche.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.280 align:middle line:84%
He would compare the
psyche to an oxbow lagoon

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.319 align:middle line:90%
like you find in the jungle--

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.420 align:middle line:84%
small oxbow lagoon-- that
is fed by the Amazon.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But that we identify with
the shores of our own lagoon.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And he would say to me, you
take the trees and the logs that

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:84%
flowed up to your beach, and
you build great sand castles

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
with them with
beautiful palm fronts.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
something goes wrong,

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.920 align:middle line:90%
the friendship doesn't turn out.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.730 align:middle line:84%
The love relationship
didn't work out.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
The business arrangement--
you take all of that material

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to the other end of the
beach, and you start again.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, I can put
my hand, he would

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
say, at the source of
that river and create

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.230 align:middle line:84%
a ripple that would change the
contours of your shoreline,

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps overturn your canoe,
or perhaps, if you had fallen

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
out of your canoe, wash
you up to the shore

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and save your life with
very little effort.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Because he's
closer to the source.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>> He's at the source.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is quantum physics.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:84%
This is that butterfly in
Beijing that flapped its wings

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.720 align:middle line:84%
and started a tropical
storm in the Caribbean,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.130 align:middle line:84%
except the Shaman
knows how to do it.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is only
descriptive, because you then

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.220 align:middle line:84%
end up asking, which one of
the 6 million butterflies

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
that flapped its
wings in Beijing when?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:90%
And how do I find it?

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.553 align:middle line:84%
And the Shaman knows the
source of that river.

00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're
taking a metaphor--

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.410 align:middle line:84%
the butterfly metaphor-- from
chaos theory and complexity

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
theory, which is linked
to quantum physics.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely, yes.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And we have a similar
metaphor, of course,

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in the medicine
traditions of working

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
very close to the source.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you're
close to the source,

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.800 align:middle line:84%
the smallest little movements
can cause major effects.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Major, major effects because
the ratio of energy to matter

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
changes by a factor of 10
or 100 as you switch levels.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And being close to the
source, as you said earlier,

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.690 align:middle line:84%
I think implies being
close to spirit.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:16.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Being one with spirit.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> One with spirit.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And, if I'm correct,
being one with spirit

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:84%
implies this very serious
process of purification.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Involves, yes, a very
serious process of purification

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and involves truly an act of
love and an act of courage

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
because most people that will
come to see a Healer want you

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:90%
to fix them.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:90%
They want you to take it away.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.280 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to
change the relationship,

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
or change the job, or
change the toxic history,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
or heal emotionally
or spiritually.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So a healing journey
is a very big journey.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's one that,
whoever embarks upon it,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:90%
I salute them for the courage.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, typically,
in our literature,

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:84%
the Shaman is one who responds
to illness and sees illness

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:90%
as a calling--

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.193 align:middle line:84%
a calling to go through this
ordeal of transformation.

00:20:12.193 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:84%
>> The training of the Shaman
is a training of the wounded

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.840 align:middle line:84%
healer that in the process
of healing herself,

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.890 align:middle line:84%
what has lived within her as
a source of wounding, of pain,

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:84%
of weakness is transformed
into a source of strength

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and compassion, so that I know
what it is to hurt because I

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:90%
know that I have hurt.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
There's where my
compassion comes from.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a warm, fuzzy feeling.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I know what it is
to hurt, so I can

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
be next to someone
who's dying and not

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.760 align:middle line:84%
have to face fear
of my own death.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you describe the
training that you went through,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.610 align:middle line:84%
some of the things that your
teachers asked you to do seem

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:90%
frightening, almost inhuman.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Like, I recall one
instance when you

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.550 align:middle line:84%
were asked to dive into
an icy cold pool of water

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
in a mountain glacier
in the middle of winter

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.330 align:middle line:84%
naked, and dive to the
bottom, and kiss the ice.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I had my
bathing suit on.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:90%
But it was still very cold.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.838 align:middle line:84%
And they were
testing my resolve,

00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of course-- testing my resolve
because they didn't want

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
me to waste their
time to indulge

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
a curious Westerner
but someone who

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
would become a bridge, in
effect, for these traditions.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I learned shortly

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.908 align:middle line:84%
after that very cold
swim was the notion

00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:34.450 align:middle line:84%
that there are
energies that we carry

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:84%
that do not belong
to us, which is

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.180 align:middle line:90%
a very foreign one in the West.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.830 align:middle line:84%
In psychology, you
assume everything

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.880 align:middle line:84%
you find within
you belongs to you,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:84%
and you have to
integrate and accept.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.040 align:middle line:90%
The Shaman calls it sorcery.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.940 align:middle line:84%
In the jungle, they call
it sorcery that somebody

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:84%
who is wishing you ill,
or who is angry with you,

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:84%
or feels that you
have betrayed them,

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that that energy can penetrate
your luminous defenses,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and contaminate your luminous
energy field in a way

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.970 align:middle line:84%
that a virus does in the body,
and that these energies have

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to be extracted.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it might even be the
spirit of a departed loved one.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be the spirit of--

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:90%
frequently, in fact, it is.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
I see many people
in my office who

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
think that they're
done with their mother

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:90%
when she passes away.

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And her spirit who has not had
closure is now afflicting her.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're opening up a
vast area of discussion here.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we're
almost out of time.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a shame that we
can't spend more time

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.783 align:middle line:84%
on the topic of soul
retrieval, which

00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I know is one of your
major interests as well.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.545 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the
fundamental healing practices

00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:41.462 align:middle line:90%
for a medicine person.

00:22:41.462 --> 00:22:44.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only do we seem to
take on foreign energy,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.570 align:middle line:90%
but we often leave our own.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>> We lose one of our own.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Adage, when we had a traumatic
event at the age of 7.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Alberto, but we
are out of time.
