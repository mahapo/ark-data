>> Thinking Allowed,
conversations on the leading

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.050 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery

Mishlove.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to explore
the cultural creatives,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
a fascinating new
demographic category.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pleased to have with
me sociologist Paul Ray,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.250 align:middle line:84%
the discoverer of the cultural
creatives category, if you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:84%
will, and author with his
wife, Sherry Ruth Anderson,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:84%
of the book "The
Cultural Creatives."

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.765 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Paul.

00:00:57.765 --> 00:00:59.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for
having me, Jeffrey.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I was searching
for a word there a moment ago.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Subculture.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Subculture, there we go.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
>> A part of American culture,
a different way of life,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.930 align:middle line:84%
different set of beliefs,
especially a different set

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
of values--

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
what's most important
in people's lives--

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:90%
and different lifestyles too.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And they comprise?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
>> 50 million Americans,
26% of the adults in the US.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
significant subculture.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's big.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:90%
It's really big.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And that means it's
really mainstream.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
California or new age

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:90%
or anything obscure like that.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a major
shift in what people believe,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:84%
what they think is
real, and so on.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So these are the people
who really take environment

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:84%
and ecology seriously, and
personal growth and development

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:90%
and relationships--

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and, and, and, and, and--
it's a long, long list.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.120 align:middle line:84%
But the main things are that
it's a shift in a whole belief

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about who's
enlightened and who's not.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about baby boomers
or bobos or anything like that.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a major shift that's
been going on for 40 years,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and it's significant
because it really

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.840 align:middle line:84%
tells us about how American
culture is changing

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
in a very dramatic way.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And many people are paying
attention to this research.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:90%
You've pioneered the research.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.252 align:middle line:90%
I believe you coined the term--

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I had to make it up.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> --the cultural creatives.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And so how does one distinguish,
in the field of demographics

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and sociology, from discovering
a subculture as opposed to,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, defining it
or creating it by fiat?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing is
values and lifestyles are what

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I've been studying.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And demographics of age
income, occupation, education,

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
things like that, turn
out to be much less

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.060 align:middle line:84%
important than what people
believe is real and significant

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was come up
with the best way of predicting

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
what people are actually going
to do when they give money

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
to good causes, when they buy a
car, a house, go on vacation--

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
what they want in life, what
they want the country to be.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it turns
out that when you

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
look at values and lifestyles
in the United States,

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
there are three
competing subcultures.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
One everybody knows about,
the moderns, the world

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:90%
according to "Time" magazine.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And another everybody also
knows about, the world

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.487 align:middle line:90%
according to Jerry Falwell.

00:03:37.487 --> 00:03:40.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the people who think
of themselves as traditionals.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The traditionals are
about 24% of the country,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:90%
just under a quarter.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.500 align:middle line:84%
They used to be about half 50
years ago, around World War II,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and they've slowly
shrunk over time.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
They're getting old,
and they're dying off,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and their children aren't
becoming traditionals.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.790 align:middle line:90%
They're becoming moderns.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Moderns-- the world,
according to "Time" magazine,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
is really a world of
getting and spending,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:90%
a world of materialism.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Your body's like a machine.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.320 align:middle line:84%
Your organization's
like a machine.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Time is money, that
kind of concern.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And so those two concerns we
know of as the culture wars.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But what's happened
is a third population

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
has emerged really
since the '60s.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And the cultural creatives
then were too few to measure.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.850 align:middle line:84%
If we had done surveys, we'd
have found them at less than 3%

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.048 align:middle line:90%
or 4% of the population.

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're up to
more than a quarter.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.560 align:middle line:84%
They've grown slowly, about half
a percent a year for 40 years.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I've had a
discussion not long ago with

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher Huston Smith,
who talks about the distinction

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
between traditional
values, modern values,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and then he calls them
postmodern values.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
But I gather that you don't
equate the cultural creatives

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:90%
with being postmodern?

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, some of them are.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] Actually, I
use a different term.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
transmodern, something

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
that cuts across, making
their own synthesis

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.860 align:middle line:84%
of the traditional and the
moderns, finding the best stuff

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and trying to create
a new kind of culture.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
I call them cultural creatives
because they're literally

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
trying to make a new way
of life, a new culture,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and they're often
succeeding at it.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:90%
So that's a crucial piece.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
What Huston is talking
about, of course,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
looks postmodern from
a philosophical sense.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But we don't want to
talk about postmodern

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.520 align:middle line:84%
like literary criticism
or art criticism

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.990 align:middle line:84%
because that really
wouldn't be it.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.510 align:middle line:84%
That's confined to a
teeny-weeny, little slice

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
of intellectuals
that really, I think,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
are off course, kind
of a hypermodernism,

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.660 align:middle line:84%
tearing down the last
vestiges of modernism.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.620 align:middle line:84%
These are folks of all social
classes, all different races,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
ethnic groups, heavily
women, however--

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.720 align:middle line:84%
that's one thing in
which they're different

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%
demographically--

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and what they want is really
a new way of life, a New Deal.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And they want a world that's
ecologically sustainable,

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're very concerned
about the whole planet, not just

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
a nationalistic perspective,
but a large planetary view,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.590 align:middle line:84%
but also an inner development,
a set of concerns.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.700 align:middle line:84%
What's subjectively
true, what's true for me,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:90%
has to really work.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And it also has to
work in the big picture

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:90%
of the whole planet.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And as I understand
this grouping,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
the cultural
creative subculture,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:90%
44 million people or so--

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> 50.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> --50, a huge group, but
the people involved don't know

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.080 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, now, that's
the interesting part.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Each person got there
all by his or herself.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The cultural
creatives, as they say,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't get there with their
whole high school graduating

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:90%
class.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] They had to
become very individualistic

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and drop out of either modern
or traditional cultures' way

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:90%
of understanding the world.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we found,
incidentally, in the 60 depth

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.490 align:middle line:84%
interviews we did on top of
all the surveys I've done--

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.845 align:middle line:84%
>> I might add, you've
surveyed how many people?

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, between 100,000 and
150,000 people over 14 years

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.080 align:middle line:90%
and 500 focus groups.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
So we did 60 depth interviews,
and, overwhelmingly,

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
every person we talked to took
anywhere from 5 to 15 years,

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:84%
about 10 years on average,
to change their life,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
to change over their
lifestyle, where

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
they lived, who they
were married to,

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
all the whole pattern of their
life to fit their beliefs.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And their beliefs kept
slowly changing as the people

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.900 align:middle line:90%
they associated with changed.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how you know
it's a real cultural shift.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Who people associated
with changed.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.030 align:middle line:84%
What was in their
houses changed.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And, most of all, what they
thought was real changed.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want to accept the
idea that the world is just

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.970 align:middle line:84%
that hard stuff you
can bump your shins on,

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.700 align:middle line:90%
a physical reality only.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:90%
It was more than that.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And the more than, rather
than just saying, well,

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.200 align:middle line:84%
modernism doesn't
work, that's how

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
it's different than, say,
being just postmodern.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> But there is this sense, as
they went through the change

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and left behind so many old
friends and acquaintances,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:84%
obviously they didn't
come across a new--

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.960 align:middle line:84%
any organization that
could speak for them,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
like the National Association
of Cultural Creatives,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:90%
or the political parties.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.840 align:middle line:84%
There must be this sense
of being out on a limb.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again,
when we've given talks--

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
my wife did the book
with me, Sherry Anderson,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.818 align:middle line:90%
a psychologist--

00:08:34.818 --> 00:08:37.360 align:middle line:84%
when we've given talks, people
have said over and over again,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, now I know
who my people are.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You've given me a reason to
be hopeful about the world.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
That sense of not knowing
who your people are

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:84%
is very important because it
really reflects the media.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.592 align:middle line:84%
The national media
don't acknowledge

00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:53.175 align:middle line:84%
that the cultural
creatives are there.

00:08:53.175 --> 00:08:56.350 align:middle line:84%
They're acting like gatekeepers
of the official culture

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
of the American life, just as
government and big business do.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.735 align:middle line:84%
And to them, those people
shouldn't be there.

00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:07.090 align:middle line:84%
It's stronger than
just saying they don't

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:90%
want to acknowledge something.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's that it shouldn't be there.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And so you get nasty
side sidelong references

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
that anybody who's different is,
by definition, kooky or flaky

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.690 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, these are very
solid, well-grounded people.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.410 align:middle line:84%
I remember when we were
interviewed recently

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
by a woman who was
doing an article--

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.833 align:middle line:84%
what was it?-- straw bale
houses for the "New York Times."

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you know,
I've been trying to find out

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.870 align:middle line:90%
who these people are.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
I thought they'd all
be kind of crazy who

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:90%
were doing straw bale houses.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But she said, you know, they're
practical, grounded people.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And she finally saw an
article that I had written,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oh, that's
who these folks are.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.660 align:middle line:90%
Now I understand it.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.040 align:middle line:84%
It's what they
believe is different.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
You see, we have a tendency
in the United States

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to attribute things to
psychology of the individual,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to say that's because
of your personality

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.870 align:middle line:90%
or how developed you are.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there are
smart ones and dumb ones.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
There are neurotic ones
and enlightened ones.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.690 align:middle line:90%
There are rich and poor.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.990 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole variety of
differences that have come up,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
that create a new
way of life because

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:90%
of different experiences.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would tend, if I
had to use one word to describe

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the cultural creatives, I
would use the word future.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
They're future oriented, where
the traditionalists strike me

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
as past oriented,
and the modernists

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:90%
strike me as present oriented.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's
certainly some of that.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
There's simultaneously a
kind of reaching back as far

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:84%
as you can go into
the deep past to see

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
if you can find symbols and
legitimations that go way back.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:84%
But yes, there is a concern
for the future of the planet,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.648 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:50.648 --> 00:10:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And the cultural
creatives are really

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:84%
leading that American
tendency to say

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm worried about
what kind of world

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
my children are going to
inherit, or my grandchildren,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.880 align:middle line:90%
30 years from now.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
In focus groups we did for
the EPA, the Environmental

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Protection Agency, in
the beginning of '99,

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
most people said,
nine out of 10,

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm really terribly
worried about the kind

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.380 align:middle line:84%
of world my children
are going to inherit.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And so then I did a
survey shortly afterwards,

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and then put that question
in, 80% of Americans

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:84%
are terribly worried
about what kind of world

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.183 align:middle line:84%
their children will inherit,
and the leadership of that

00:11:27.183 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be the
cultural creatives.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.493 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the leadership on
ecological sustainability

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:34.160 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be the
cultural creatives.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.280 align:middle line:84%
The leadership on
social justice issues

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:84%
turned out to be
culture creatives

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and the personal growth
and development stuff.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:84%
What we're finding is these
are people who have really

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
become opinion leaders
around many new developments

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:90%
in American life.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Paul, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:57.090 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:90%
>> We're back.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with
sociologist Paul Ray

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
about a unique
subculture identified

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:90%
as the cultural creatives.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And before our break, Paul, you
said that these are the opinion

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:90%
leaders--

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, for new changes.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:90%
>> --for new changes.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.110 align:middle line:84%
That's different than, I
think, what the traditionalists

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
rail against when they talk
about the cultural elite.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Cultural creatives are all
different social classes.

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
They're definitely not the top
most affluent opinion leaders

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:90%
in Washington or New York.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.200 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't control the
newspapers and the film

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.000 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite the contrary.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They never see their
face shown in the media.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're folks who are
pretty ordinary in lots of ways,

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.510 align:middle line:84%
but they have one
thing in common.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Those concerns for environment,
for women's issues,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.170 align:middle line:84%
for relationships,
for social justice,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.160 align:middle line:90%
for alternative health care--

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
all those, all grow
out of the '60s, '70s,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.620 align:middle line:84%
'80s, '90s social
movements-- a whole set

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.100 align:middle line:84%
of changes in consciousness
that we could call consciousness

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
movements, if you
like, big trends,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.260 align:middle line:84%
and actual social movements
with people demonstrating

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:90%
on the barricades.

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.820 align:middle line:84%
But all the cultural creatives
are the supporters of those.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
be the people who

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:90%
are the most active activists.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
They are the folks who read
everything and gave money

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.990 align:middle line:84%
and really paid attention
and, most of all, applied it.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And what we found that
was really stunning

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:84%
about cultural creatives was
that each of the movements

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
had done something
that was crucial to how

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
the cultural
creatives came to be.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:84%
They all engaged in
what's called reframing.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So you had cases like
Martin Luther King.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
In the days of the
mid to late '50s,

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:84%
King was considered
a real troublemaker

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
by the other Black leadership
because he didn't play

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:90%
the game of ethnic politics.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather, he said this condition
of the Blacks in the South

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.170 align:middle line:84%
is a violation of freedom,
justice, the Constitution,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.678 align:middle line:84%
basic human dignity, and
it violates the promises we

00:14:07.678 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:90%
made to ourselves as Americans.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>> He appealed to our ideals.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
>> He appealed to our ideals
and articulated a philosophy

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.630 align:middle line:90%
of non-violence to go with it.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
That was crucial.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say it's
time the Blacks got

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.640 align:middle line:84%
theirs 'cause we
delivered the vote,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.300 align:middle line:84%
like the Irish and the
other Catholic ethnic groups

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.500 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.410 align:middle line:84%
He, instead, put it
in terms of something

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that every American had
to pay attention to.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.030 align:middle line:84%
About that same
time, other people

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
picked up reframing the
issues in a new way as well.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Betty Friedan, in "The
Feminine Mystique" in '62,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
she didn't say women have got to
crash through the glass ceiling

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:90%
just to make more money.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:84%
She said this is
about who women are.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And the majority
of the human race,

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
why aren't our
concerns, our language,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:90%
being paid attention to?

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, Rachel Carson

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
said this is not just
about keeping pollution out

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:90%
of your backyard.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.770 align:middle line:84%
In "The Silent
Spring," she said this

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:90%
is about the death of nature.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.100 align:middle line:84%
If the birds, the bees, and all
the other animals and plants

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:84%
die at the spring, humanity
will die shortly thereafter.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, those reframings
were really

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.980 align:middle line:84%
deep and fundamental
because they

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.890 align:middle line:84%
took a causal
explanation that was new

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and a moral explanation
that was new

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and added new moral categories.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So Americans who consider
themselves very moral today

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:84%
are rather different
than Americans

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.700 align:middle line:84%
who saw the world
as a moral stance,

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
say, in the '50s and '60s.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think, if
I may interject it,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not just about morals
in an intellectual sense.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about something
very emotional for people.

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.590 align:middle line:90%
You bet.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:46.500 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Part of the issue
with psychedelics,

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.780 align:middle line:84%
part of the issue with
holistic health instead

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:84%
of standard medical care,
personal growth psychology

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
was dealing directly
with the issue

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.870 align:middle line:90%
of what's personally authentic.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.320 align:middle line:84%
What's real for me
inwardly is a big deal

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and has gotten redefined, just
as the large planetary concerns

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.550 align:middle line:84%
or social justice concerns
have gotten redefined.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So we've literally added
15, 20 moral categories

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't have, and we've
added a very "systemsy" view

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
of the world instead
of the fragmented

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:90%
factoids of modernism.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
In the modern world,
you're supposed

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.230 align:middle line:84%
to focus your attention
down very tight,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.090 align:middle line:90%
nose to the grindstone--

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Business as usual.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.038 align:middle line:90%
>> --business as usual.

00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Get out of my way.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm dressed for success.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm gonna focus very efficiently
on what needs to get done.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.205 align:middle line:84%
And the traditionals
are fending things off.

00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cultural creatives are
picking this fact and that one

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
and that one and putting
together a new world view,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's what makes
them so interesting to me.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how effective can
50 million people be when

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.210 align:middle line:84%
you've got another 50 million
pulling the other direction

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional
camp and, I gather,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.450 align:middle line:84%
maybe 100 million people who
are sort of going along with

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:90%
the tide of modernism?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the right
question because the cultural

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:84%
creatives haven't been
politically mobilized yet.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.460 align:middle line:90%
So the question is will they be?

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.635 align:middle line:84%
And at this moment,
nobody knows.

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:17.760 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible to predict.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm not sure that
political mobilization is

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.069 align:middle line:90%
the way to go, in any case.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, it's not.

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
people who've primarily

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:90%
been changing the culture.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they've all been
in the political side of all

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:84%
those different
social movements.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Each of the movements
had a cultural side,

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:84%
was primarily trying
to change our minds,

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.310 align:middle line:84%
change the way we saw the
world, change the way we lived.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And so they've been
pretty successful at that.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I think you have to say
something like this.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
These are the people who are
providing most of the social

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:84%
inventions of our time, a lot of
social inventions that are not

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:90%
covered-- basically not news--

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.200 align:middle line:90%
in the newspaper.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
technology inventions.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
say, over and over

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
again, they're coming
up with new things that

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:90%
are quite interesting.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Those will have an effect.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:84%
They're making new
kinds of businesses.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
There's a serious
brain drain out

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.400 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the corporations
of cultural creatives

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.628 align:middle line:84%
who are saying this is a
terrible place to work.

00:18:12.628 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand it anymore.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make
my own business.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:90%
And so that's part of it too.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So you're seeing inventions
somewhere in the business

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.630 align:middle line:84%
sector that's not the giant mega
corporations that are always

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.470 align:middle line:84%
written about, but
rather a lot of smaller

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
to mid-sized businesses.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Entrepreneurial.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Entrepreneurial,
very change oriented,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:84%
very flat organizations
without so much hierarchy,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
very collegial, worried about
nice places to work on the one

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
hand, worried about ecological
sustainability on the other

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:90%
hand.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.510 align:middle line:84%
So you have a social invention
like the triple bottom line--

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that is, it has to,
yes, make a profit,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.060 align:middle line:84%
but it also has to be
good for the environment,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and it has to be a good place
to be in terms of where you work

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:90%
and how you treat your people.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe I get
too caught up in this,

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.450 align:middle line:84%
but I'm under the impression
that that's affecting

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're a modernist
or a traditionalist,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:84%
you want to have a
work environment that

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.130 align:middle line:90%
satisfies your inner being.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And what you've got is a real
tendency of people to accept

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.260 align:middle line:84%
the given world and not
be inventive socially,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and so there's a lot of
complaining in the rest

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.600 align:middle line:90%
of the culture.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.993 align:middle line:84%
But the cultural creatives
are out there doing something.

00:19:24.993 --> 00:19:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again,
we found that these

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.993 align:middle line:84%
are the people who volunteer
the most, who give the most

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
money to good
causes, who show up,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.810 align:middle line:90%
who want to walk their talk.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
They may not walk their
talk all the time,

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
but they really feel bad
about it if they don't.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how much interaction
is there amongst these main

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.460 align:middle line:90%
cultural segments?

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Are cultural creatives
moving into the other worlds

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.880 align:middle line:84%
of the modernists and
the traditionalists?

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they're in the world
of the moderns all the time.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hard to avoid.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Hard to avoid, and they're
not necessarily happy about it,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and the moderns may think
they're a little far out,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.108 align:middle line:90%
a little weird.

00:19:59.108 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of cultural
creatives feel they

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
have to sit on
themselves a lot at work,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.600 align:middle line:90%
not talk about their values--

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.803 align:middle line:84%
or in public life,
for that matter.

00:20:07.803 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The traditionals are the ones
who have really pulled loose

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:90%
from modern society.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.142 align:middle line:84%
They're much less engaged,
much more willing to form

00:20:16.142 --> 00:20:17.225 align:middle line:90%
their own little enclaves.

00:20:17.225 --> 00:20:20.168 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.168 --> 00:20:22.460 align:middle line:84%
The traditionals and the
moderns having the culture war

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
is one idea, but the cultural
creatives and the moderns

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
are having a learning process.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.750 align:middle line:84%
The moderns often
are good at imitating

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.670 align:middle line:84%
what the cultural creatives
have come up with,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.760 align:middle line:84%
and that makes an interesting
process of cultural change.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Let me remind our
viewers that we're

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.960 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
cultural subgroup,

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
the cultural creatives,
50 million people who

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
are committed to personal
growth, spiritual awareness,

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
a holistic view of things, and
an ecological sensitivity, if I

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%
can summarize it in a nutshell.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:84%
As we're drawing toward the
close of our interview, Paul,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
let me ask you, as a
student of this phenomenon,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.770 align:middle line:84%
how do you think the
cultural creatives can

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:90%
move to become most effective?

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the main thing
is to gather together,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.810 align:middle line:84%
to have places to go,
to meet each other,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to sniff each other out and
decide if they like each other,

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.700 align:middle line:84%
to have events that they go
to, occasions, coffee shops,

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.410 align:middle line:90%
all that sort of thing.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a matter of meeting
and deciding what kind of world

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:90%
they want to create together.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And so, to a large
extent, it's simply

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:84%
getting into larger
and larger circles

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.860 align:middle line:90%
and starting to create together.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.440 align:middle line:84%
The other part, of
course, is that they will

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:90%
start mobilizing politically.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.690 align:middle line:84%
They will start becoming
more visible in the media.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Right now, even as we speak,
there's all sorts of media,

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
like yours, who want to
appeal to cultural creatives

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.515 align:middle line:84%

>> "The Cultural
Creatives," naturally.

00:22:03.167 --> 00:22:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying,
if I hear you right,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
is that this movement
isn't stagnating.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's growing.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's growing, and
it's likely to accelerate.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
While we're looking at a
time in the immediate future,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.890 align:middle line:84%
in the next five
to 10 years, when

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
it's likely to grow to maybe
half the population of the US,

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
in our studies, one
of the things we found

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:84%
was there's an additional 20%
of Americans, another 40 million

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.747 align:middle line:84%
people, who really buy most
of the cultural creative world

00:22:29.747 --> 00:22:31.580 align:middle line:84%
view, but they're very
concerned it wouldn't

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:90%
be successful for them.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And it includes a lot of
Blacks, a lot of Hispanics,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of ethnic
Catholics of one flavor

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:43.760 align:middle line:84%
or another who see
this with longing,

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and they want that
world, but they're not

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:90%
quite ready to jump.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:84%
But they will get on that train
if they see it pulling out

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.190 align:middle line:90%
of the station.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a hopeful sign.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Paul Ray, thank you so
much for being with me.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been enlightening
and inspiring.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
