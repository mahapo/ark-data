00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove, and
this is the second part

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.770 align:middle line:84%
of our two-part interview
with Dr. Elizabeth Targ, one

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
of the country's
foremost researchers

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:84%
on psychic and
spiritual healing,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:90%
the subject of our program.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Targ is director of the
Complementary Medicine Research

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Institute at the California
Pacific Medical Center

in San Francisco.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.550 align:middle line:84%
She's also a professor in
the Department of Psychiatry

at the University of
California Medical

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Center in San Francisco.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Welcome again, Elizabeth.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks very much.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure to be with
you and to talk and share with

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
our audience the very exciting,
pivotal research that you are

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.790 align:middle line:84%
doing in the field
of psychic healing.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.250 align:middle line:84%
In our first program,
you described work

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.500 align:middle line:84%
with healers who were using a
method which researchers have

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
come to call a distant
mental influence.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.620 align:middle line:84%
We could think of it as
psychic or spiritual healing.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And you were working
with AIDS patients.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And what you said is--

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
many things that you said,
but one of the things

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
you pointed out is that there
was a dramatic difference

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
between the patients who
received the healing intentions

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and those who did not.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And you listed for us maybe
a dozen different parameters,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.540 align:middle line:84%
qualities that you
observed in order

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:90%
to measure that difference.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it would
be interesting to go

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
through the different physical
and psychological effects

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:90%
of the distant healing.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.940 align:middle line:90%
What we saw in our study--

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's important, I
think, for the viewers

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this is a
study where the patients did

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.960 align:middle line:84%
not know whether or not they
were receiving healing efforts

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%
from these different healers.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So it couldn't
have been suggestion.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It couldn't have
been suggestion,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.950 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have been--

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> A placebo effect.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> --a placebo in that sense.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The people who received
the healing had

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:84%
fewer new illnesses,
and the illnesses they

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
had were less severe.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
They also had fewer
doctor visits,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in fact quite
dramatically so, which

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.768 align:middle line:84%
is something at some
points we thought

00:02:37.768 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
might be interesting to the
different HMO and insurance

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:90%
They had fewer hospitalizations.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And the hospitalizations
they had were shorter.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.920 align:middle line:84%
We had 68 hospital days in
the control group versus 10

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.000 align:middle line:90%
in the treatment group.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And remembering
those hospital days

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:84%
usually come in at about
$500 to $900 a day,

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that is a really important
difference in terms

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.580 align:middle line:90%
of medical utilization.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We also looked at
psychological outcomes.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And we found that the people
who were in the treatment group

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:84%
went down in their psychological
distress scores by 25 points.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The people who were
in the control group

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.380 align:middle line:84%
went up in their psychological
distress scores by 14 points.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that was also a
significant difference.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:84%
When we broke that down to find
out which were the measures

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
within the distress, we found
that the treatment patients

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.000 align:middle line:84%
were showing less depression
and less anxiety and less anger

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:90%
and that they showed more vigor.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.800 align:middle line:84%
They also showed less
cognitive difficulty,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
which has been a really
important problem for people

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:90%
with HIV.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We also looked at the CD4
counts, their T-cell count,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
which people have been
very interested in.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We did not see a significant
difference between the two

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.670 align:middle line:90%
groups on that measure.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we saw what
you would expect,

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:84%
that since all of these
patients in both groups

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
were getting top-notch
medical care,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that everybody had
some improvement

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:84%
in their T-cell count,
which was good news.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And we also looked at mortality.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
In our first study,
we had found--

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in our pilot study, which
just had 20 patients in it,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.830 align:middle line:84%
at that point in the control
group, 40% of those patients

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
died over the
period of the study,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.120 align:middle line:84%
whereas nobody in the
treatment groups died.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's significant.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very remarkable, and
it was really what spurred us

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:84%
to go ahead and do
this larger trial.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And in the new
trial, what we did

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.365 align:middle line:84%
is in the first trial we had
controlled for the things--

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
you have to think
about what else

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:90%
could have made a difference?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
Was one group sicker
than the other?

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Had one group been
sick with HIV longer?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Had one had more illnesses?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Were they taking
different medications?

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We looked at all those
things in the first trial.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
went to look at age,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:84%
we found that the people who
were in the control group

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:90%
were somewhat older.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.150 align:middle line:84%
So we thought, maybe
that was an explanation.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Because these trials
were always looking for,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
is there anything different
between the groups?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
So in this in the new
trial, we balanced

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
for 23 different baseline
variables, including

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.525 align:middle line:84%
religious beliefs and belief
in distant healing and--

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So that just by random you
wouldn't have a population more

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:90%
likely to improve.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is
that there were not

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:84%
any significant differences
on those measures

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in the second trial.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
In the second trial,
there was no difference--

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
there was no significant
difference in mortality.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
There was one
unfortunate patient

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
who did die who was in
the control group who

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.830 align:middle line:90%
didn't get this treatment.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
But the treatments
for AIDS have gotten

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:84%
to be so much better that people
are doing really much, much

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.165 align:middle line:90%
better these days.

00:05:56.165 --> 00:05:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's good.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And now the government has
funded you to do a third study.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:84%
>> They're satisfied enough
with the rigor of your research

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.698 align:middle line:90%
in the first two.

00:06:08.698 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they were
very excited about it.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we're going
to be doing now

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
is looking at even more
biological measures

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and also looking at people
testing healers who--

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:84%
or people as
healers who have not

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.685 align:middle line:84%
had previous experience,
which is a difference.

00:06:24.685 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in our first interview,
in the first part of this

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
two-part series, you told me
that on one occasion you had

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:84%
attended a medical conference
at Harvard University looking

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.670 align:middle line:84%
at this phenomenon, distant
mental influence as a healing

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.890 align:middle line:90%
modality.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And many researchers were there,
but only under the condition

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.970 align:middle line:90%
that they attend anonymously.

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
There wasn't a membership list.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> How does the
medical community,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.390 align:middle line:84%
when you talk to mainstream
medical professionals today

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.230 align:middle line:84%
about your research,
how do they respond?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The response has been
almost completely positive.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I really have the
feeling that people

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:84%
have been all sort of secretly
hoping this would work.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Including a lot of medical
professionals and researchers

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.250 align:middle line:90%
who are people too, after all.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Even skeptics.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Even skeptics.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:84%
We have now presented this work
at quite a number of mainstream

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:90%
medical conferences.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And the uniform response
has been, this is amazing.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.290 align:middle line:84%
This is extremely
well controlled.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.310 align:middle line:84%
When are you going
to do it again?

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the new study,
what we want to do

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.180 align:middle line:90%
is expand our measures.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And we're looking
for whether there

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.050 align:middle line:84%
are what you call
biological markers,

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.160 align:middle line:84%
whether there's anything to
give us an indication of how

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.785 align:middle line:90%
it might be working.

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing we want to do

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:84%
is to find out more about what
the range of possible effects

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:90%
might be.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting that you
use the phrase "the patients

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
who received the
healing treatment."

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Because on the one
hand, you see that there

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.660 align:middle line:90%
are measurable effects.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other hand, you
have healers who are told

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on
particular patients.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:84%
But we have no clue
as to what mechanism--

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
if it is a mechanism.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:90%
I suspect it's non-mechanistic--

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.780 align:middle line:90%
that links these.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We really have no
idea how it works.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
makes some researchers

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.830 align:middle line:84%
nervous in doing
these experiments.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.960 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that scientific
methodology is actually

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
perfectly set up to allow
us to test things, to test,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:90%
does it work or does it not?

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:90%
Even if we don't know how.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many treatments
in medicine that are known

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to work, and we don't
know exactly how.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:90%
I think aspirin.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Aspirin is an example.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:90%
Quinine was an example.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
There have been a lot of
things in that category

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to
do some studies.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
We are doing some
studies that may give us

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:90%
some hints about this.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.220 align:middle line:84%
My colleague Dr.
Garret Yount, who's

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
a molecular geneticist
at our institute,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is doing studies
of healing attempts

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
by qigong masters who use a
kind of Chinese energy healing.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:22.090 align:middle line:84%
And they're trying to
improve the survival of cells

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:24.640 align:middle line:84%
in test tubes or
in Petri dishes.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And that gives him an
opportunity, for example,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:84%
to look then at what specific
genetic or enzyme or protein

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
mechanism might be
accounting for that.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And he's also having very, very
promising results at this time.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other hand, I think
if you talk to the healers

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
themselves, if you ask them,
many of them would say, well,

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:90%
God does the healing.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Many of them would.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, not
all of them would.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.020 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the people
who were healers in our study,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
about 50% of them describe
themselves as energy healers.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And a significant
number of those

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:84%
also felt that it was
a spiritual healing.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.582 align:middle line:84%
There were only
about 15% who said

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that what they felt
they were doing

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:84%
was a purely devotional
process or in relation to God

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.540 align:middle line:90%
or a higher power.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
I think science is going
to have to continue

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
to work to develop
terms to understand

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.198 align:middle line:90%
what people are doing.

00:10:30.198 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many ways
that people look at it.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And when we try to divide out
whether it made a difference

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.400 align:middle line:84%
what one healer was
doing versus another--

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What their
belief system was--

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:39.627 align:middle line:84%
>> --what their
belief system was,

00:10:39.627 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
we have not yet found something.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't mean
that there isn't something.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But at least in our
first examination

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.420 align:middle line:84%
so far, we're not finding
any evidence that at least

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.850 align:middle line:84%
among the people who were
healers in our study,

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.370 align:middle line:84%
that one approach was
better than the other.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I do recall Dr. Bernard
Grad at McGill University,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
if I remember correctly,
discovered that if a person is

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.240 align:middle line:84%
depressed, they could
have an opposite effect.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
If they attempt to do
healing, I think with plants,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.790 align:middle line:84%
he said they had the brown
thumb effect rather than

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
the green thumb.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, we're
going to take a break.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr. Elizabeth
Targ, one of America's leading

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
researchers in the field of
psychic and spiritual healing.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, now we've covered
the empirical studies

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
that you've been doing with
distant mental influence,

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
people who receive the
healing intentionalities

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.640 align:middle line:90%
of a professional healer.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You've also done
work with patients

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.925 align:middle line:84%
who get involved in support
groups of a spiritual nature.

00:11:56.925 --> 00:11:58.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.330 align:middle line:84%
The work we're doing
with the support groups

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.890 align:middle line:84%
is a program comparing
two different kinds

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.970 align:middle line:84%
of group psychotherapy,
which, as people know,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.750 align:middle line:84%
has already been demonstrated
in studies by David

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Spiegel at Stanford to be
very beneficial for women

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.470 align:middle line:90%
with breast cancer.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:84%
What we were
interested in is what

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:84%
other kinds of psychotherapy
approaches or experiences

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.670 align:middle line:90%
might be helpful.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a study now
where we randomized women

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to either be in a standard
group psychotherapy of the type

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that's widely available
in the community,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:84%
or to be in a group therapy
program that involved

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.290 align:middle line:84%
spiritual exploration through
many different modalities,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
including meditation, yoga,
practices with contemplations

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
on loving kindness and on
forgiveness, also on death.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.180 align:middle line:84%
They do work with
movement and dance

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
and different kind
of ritual forms,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
such as the traditional counsel
process that derives out

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:84%
of the Native American
tradition for storytelling

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:90%
and witnessing.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all modalities that
in previous generations were

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
quite separate and
distinct from medicine.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they've rarely been
used in an active medical

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.630 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And they've been not yet
very well incorporated

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:90%
into psychology.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Although I would venture
to say that in that age

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
of Hippocrates, in the
ancient Greek healing temples,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:90%
that is exactly how it was done.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
This is where medicine
really came from.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's very similar
to, as you say,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Greek traditions,
the shamanic traditions.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
These are all
techniques which have

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.560 align:middle line:84%
existed in many, many
cultures throughout the world.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:90%
>> And what are you finding?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What we're finding is-- it's
very interesting, actually.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
We've randomized
women to these groups.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
getting to choose.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard for all
of us, I think mostly hard

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:90%
for the women.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.420 align:middle line:84%
But all of us would like
to see people choosing.

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But what we actually
did is we wanted

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
to know, how do these
experiences affect everybody,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.460 align:middle line:84%
not just people who
are drawn to them.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding is that
regardless of people's, say,

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:84%
particular spiritual beliefs
or affinity when they come in,

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that the women who are
randomized to the what we call

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.080 align:middle line:84%
integrated program, the
psycho-spiritual program,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
are showing increases
in formal measures

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
of so-called
spiritual well-being.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:84%
They're also showing
significant improvement

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:43.320 align:middle line:84%
in their levels of distress
and depression and anxiety

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and improved social
functioning all those things,

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.600 align:middle line:90%
just like the other group.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we would expect.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Although certainly some
people have been afraid

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.760 align:middle line:84%
that if you bring people into
these kinds of meditations

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and imagery that it's
just a form of denial,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's just going to prevent
them from really doing the work

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:84%
they need to do to learn
to cope with their illness.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
But they've shown
not only improvement

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.490 align:middle line:84%
in all those measures,
but also improvement

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
in measures of faith
and peacefulness

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and a construct called
embracing life, which

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
has to do with actually
accepting death,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
a feeling that they're getting
nourishment from nature,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.170 align:middle line:84%
a feeling that there is a
rightness to what happens day

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.970 align:middle line:90%
to day.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Formal measures of
spiritual well-being.

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Formal measures,
that's right.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I've never heard
that phrase before.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.460 align:middle line:84%
To me-- and I've interviewed
hundreds of people

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
on spirituality--
it has always seemed

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.220 align:middle line:84%
like one of the most
indefinable of all topics.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
formal measures.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would agree that
it's an indefinable measure.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
that there are

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.600 align:middle line:84%
things that give us a hint
about where people are

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.040 align:middle line:90%
putting their consciousness.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But now from a
medical perspective,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I can imagine somebody may
grow spiritually enormously

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.022 align:middle line:84%
and still die from
their illness.

00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's certainly possible.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.105 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
questions we're asking.

00:16:06.105 --> 00:16:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So in our study,
we do not yet have

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:16.057 align:middle line:84%
any information about the
long-term medical effects.

00:16:16.057 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your goal.

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
we'd like to find out.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
what we're finding

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is that the women going
through this program

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
are more content in their
lives, are talking with us

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:84%
about being able to make
extraordinary transformation

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
in their personal lives
and their connections

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And by my way of
thinking, that's

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:84%
really what life
is all about, too.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, not long
ago, I interviewed one

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
of your colleagues,
Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen,

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
about women and men facing
life-threatening illnesses.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And she said that the
very fact that one

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.360 align:middle line:84%
faces a life-threatening
condition

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:84%
triggers a kind of
spiritual process.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I would agree.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
I might say it slightly
differently, though.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd say that at least it creates
the opportunity for movement

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:90%
in that direction.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.740 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some people
who will not do that.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They may not have the
support to do that,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:84%
or they may not
have the interest.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:24.890 align:middle line:90%
It definitely triggers a crisis.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things we had to do

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.940 align:middle line:84%
for the study, if we were going
to do a study of spirituality,

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:90%
is we had to define it.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And we defined it as to do
with meaning and purpose,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:84%
connection, and used
Frances Vaughan's term,

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
the subjective
experience of the sacred.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Developing a
life-threatening illness

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
is a challenge in each
one of those areas.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:84%
It challenges our
sense of identity.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
We may not be able to be who
we thought we were anymore,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:90%
do our job.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We lose, often, a sense of
connection with our community

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:90%
and our family.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
become completely numb

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:90%
in the face of illness.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.680 align:middle line:84%
So even by that very
simple definition,

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I think you can say that a
life-threatening illness is

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.420 align:middle line:90%
a spiritual crisis.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
The question in crisis
is always the issue

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.130 align:middle line:90%
of danger and opportunity.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're hoping
to do in our program

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is create support
for women to take

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:90%
advantage of that opportunity.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, in general, people--

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
women and men who get
involved in support groups

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
do better than those
who don't, regardless

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.375 align:middle line:84%
of what kind of a
support group it is.

00:18:41.375 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> There haven't been so many
studies on different kinds.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And certain there have
been-- this is a new area,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.290 align:middle line:84%
but there's certainly been
evidence that they do better

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.090 align:middle line:90%
in some kinds.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So your intention is to look
at spiritual types of support

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it would seem to me
that if the earlier principle

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.900 align:middle line:84%
that you were looking
at, distant influence,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.258 align:middle line:84%
if that principle holds, and
if it's a widely distributed

00:19:07.258 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
skill, it would certainly
mean that a person could heal

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:90%
themselves also.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You would think so.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.607 align:middle line:84%
Actually, there was
an interesting study

00:19:13.607 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
by Dr. Sean O'Laoire who is a
psychologist and also a priest.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.407 align:middle line:84%
And he did a study
of distant healing.

00:19:21.407 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
And an interesting
thing is the people

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
who were healers in his study
had no previous experience

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:90%
as healers.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And what he found at
the end of the study

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is that the healers
themselves had

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.165 align:middle line:84%
shown significant
psychological improvement.

00:19:36.165 --> 00:19:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And so when you ask him, well,
why do you think that happened?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is it you
taught these people?

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.390 align:middle line:84%
How did they do their healing,
since they never did it?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.440 align:middle line:84%
What he did was he instructed
these novice healers

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to sit every day, to calm
and center themselves,

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to imagine themselves surrounded
by a bubble of white light,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and to allow a sensation
of love to permeate

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:84%
themselves and
extend to the patient

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:90%
they were supposed to heal.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not surprising that
that made them feel better too.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a
kind of overlap area,

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it seems, in these
healing practices,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:14.020 align:middle line:84%
that some are very
direct, and then some

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:19.780 align:middle line:84%
may also extend over space,
maybe over time as well.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, your
father, Russell Targ,

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
has written a book recently
called "The Heart of The Mind,"

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
in which he suggests that all
authentic spiritual traditions

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
have in common the understanding
that we can reside in love,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that love is a fundamental
spiritual experience that cuts

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
across all belief systems.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And your work seems to
suggest, and the work

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:53.260 align:middle line:84%
you just cited suggests that
the very experience of allowing

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
oneself to be in a peaceful,
calm, loving, compassionate

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.820 align:middle line:84%
state sends out, one
might say, vibrations

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:90%
into the environment.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:90%
It's good for you.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.000 align:middle line:90%
It's good for everyone else.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It may well be the case.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think of it
as a form of relaxation.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:84%
If people are well known to do
better medically if they learn

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
to relax through yoga or
meditation or stretching,

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe there is an
extended relaxation

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.220 align:middle line:90%
that lets more of that love in.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Love may be the
best medicine of all.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.070 align:middle line:84%
In fact, certainly I know from
my interview with Dr. Dean

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Ornish that he claimed the one
factor that was the strongest

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
factor ever researched
is simply people

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.057 align:middle line:90%
who are in good relationships.

00:21:42.057 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's interesting.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we
observed in our distant healing

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:84%
study is really the
generosity of the healers

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:90%
who participated.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.060 align:middle line:84%
We had people who participated
with us who their job in life,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
they are paid as healers
like any other professionals.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And many of them donated
to us more than 100 hours

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of their professional time,
for which they were never paid.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:84%
They knew that
they would never be

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.180 align:middle line:84%
able to get personal
acknowledgment

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.690 align:middle line:84%
of the fact of their
participation in the study.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet they were
willing to do this.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.162 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, many of them have
volunteered to do it again.

00:22:17.162 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
>> They're not in it for
the fame or the money.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:90%
They're not.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And I imagine it's a
service to all of humanity.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm thrilled,
Dr. Elizabeth

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Targ, to be having this
discussion with you now.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:90%
It has been a real pleasure.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:36.640 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to cover
the empirical side,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual side of things,
the medical issues involved.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a great tribute
to you and to the institutions

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.265 align:middle line:84%
that support you that this
research is taking place.

00:22:49.265 --> 00:22:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> More than anything else,
I just hope it makes possible

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.187 align:middle line:84%
for more people to make use of
these treatments and to study

00:22:55.187 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:84%
them so we can really
understand them.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for being
with me, Elizabeth.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being with us.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:90%
