00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Today we're exploring
the meaning of light.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.660 align:middle line:84%
My guest, Peter
Russell, is a physicist

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:84%
who studied at Cambridge
University with Stephen

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:90%
Hawking.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.900 align:middle line:84%
He is also author
of numerous books,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
including "Waking Up in Time,"
"The Global Brain," "The TM

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Book," "The Brain Book," and a
translation of the Upanishads.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.450 align:middle line:84%
He is a fellow of the
Institute of Noetic Sciences

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:90%
in Sausalito, California.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Peter.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Light seems to be at the core
of many of the paradoxes that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.830 align:middle line:84%
we experience both in
philosophy and in science,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.640 align:middle line:90%
and in the spiritual realm.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think a good place to look
at that paradox most explicitly

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
has to do with Einstein's theory
of relativity and the idea

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.780 align:middle line:84%
that the speed of light
is constant no matter

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
how fast you may be moving
in relationship to anything.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> This was actually one
of the paradoxes at the end

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:90%
of the last century.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.402 align:middle line:84%
It actually came out of
work by Maxwell, who--

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>> James Clark Maxwell.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.485 align:middle line:84%
>> James Clark Maxwell,
who developed what's called

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:90%
Maxwell's equations.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> The electromagnetic spectrum.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And what was
interesting about that,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
he showed that the world
wasn't just a world of matter.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
There were these
electromagnetic waves.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And out of his
equations came the fact

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
that the speed of light
should always be the same.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.190 align:middle line:84%
This came out of
the mathematics.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.553 align:middle line:90%
And no one quite believed that.

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And people were doing
experiments trying

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:90%
to measure the speed of light.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.847 align:middle line:84%
And they found--
looking for changes.

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if the Earth's
going around the sun,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.888 align:middle line:84%
at certain times it's moving
faster in one direction,

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
certain times faster
in other direction.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And that should cause the
relative speed of light

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
from stars passing
the Earth to change.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Which would be true of
virtually any other speed.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you're
traveling down the road in a car

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
at 30 miles an hour,
another car passes you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.750 align:middle line:84%
at 40 miles, an hour, it
would go 10 miles an hour

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:90%
faster than you.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
If it's going at 30 miles an
hour, you'd be side by side.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
You can have a conversation
with the driver.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.290 align:middle line:90%
Light is different.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.795 align:middle line:90%
However fast you move--

00:02:34.795 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:90%
light's moving much faster.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
It's 186,000 miles a second.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
However fast you move,
light still overtakes you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:90%
at the same speed.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
So even if you were traveling
at 185,999 miles per second,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
light wouldn't go by one
mile an hour second faster.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.242 align:middle line:84%
It would go by at 186,000
miles an hour faster.

00:02:54.242 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There are all sorts of
paradoxes implicit in that,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I would think.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There are, because,
well, that they would be,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:84%
because it means that the
whole notion of relative speed

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And what Einstein
did was he said,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
let's accept that
anomaly as a fact.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying to explain
it and twist our heads up

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and twist physics up trying to
understand this strange thing,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.180 align:middle line:84%
let's just accept as a premise
that the speed of light

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.610 align:middle line:84%
is always the same
for all observers

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.240 align:middle line:90%
however fast they're moving.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't agree with
common sense at all,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
but that was his big break.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's
forget common sense.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's accept this is what
things seem to be showing us.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Then, how does
the universe look?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.702 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was
that the normal universe

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that you and I live
in, where we're

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:84%
moving at very, very, very slow
speeds comparable to light,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:90%
nothing changes.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
However, what he found
was as you move faster,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.990 align:middle line:90%
things do change.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And space, time,
and mass all change.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We think space, time,
and mass are absolutes.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.790 align:middle line:84%
What Einstein showed
is they're not.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.020 align:middle line:84%
As you go faster,
time slows down.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
clocks slowing.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything, the whole physical
world is going slower.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.190 align:middle line:84%
The rate at which electrons
spin in their orbit-- everything

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
is slowing down
as you go faster.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Also, distance is
getting shorter

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and shorter and shorter.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And mass is getting heavier
and heavier and heavier.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So these things
are not absolutes.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not, no.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Space, time, and mass
are not absolute.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, if you
were traveling at the speed

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
of light, you could travel
to the end of the universe

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:90%
and back.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It might take billions of
years from our perspective

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:90%
here on the planet.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you returned,
you would not have aged.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you were traveling
at the speed of light,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.730 align:middle line:90%
very interesting things happen.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.443 align:middle line:84%
If you were to travel very
near the speed of light,

00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
you might think you
would not have aged.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you would have done
because you have to turn round.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
That gets into a
whole other problem,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.230 align:middle line:84%
because you're
going out very fast,

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.772 align:middle line:84%
and you come back
very fast, but when

00:04:58.772 --> 00:05:00.617 align:middle line:84%
you slow down and
turn around, you

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
would actually catch up on a lot
of your aging at that moment.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And also, I suppose
we ought to point out

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.110 align:middle line:84%
that nothing with mass can
travel at the speed of light.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because
anything with--

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
the faster you go, the
more mass increases.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:84%
If you were to travel
at the speed of light,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:90%
your mass would become infinite.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And an infinite mass would
require an infinite amount

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.867 align:middle line:84%
of energy to move it, and
there isn't an infinite amount

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
of energy in the universe.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they
say nothing can ever

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
travel at the speed of light.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.150 align:middle line:84%
However, light travels
at the speed of light.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And light does that
because light has no mass.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.240 align:middle line:84%
But also, if you then look at
the equations of relativity

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.060 align:middle line:84%
for light, what you
find is that time

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:84%
has slowed to a
complete standstill,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
and distance, the
direction of travel,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
has collapsed to nothing.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So from light's point of
view, it doesn't actually

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
travel anywhere, and it
takes no time to do it.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
What we see is a light
beam crossing this room

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
or crossing the universe,
from light's perspective,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:90%
it's going nowhere.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Light is everywhere
all at once.

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's like--

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.050 align:middle line:90%
not quite that.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like the point of emission
and absorption of a photon

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.040 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The points that the universe is
contracted, they are the same.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
So what it means is, from
light's point of view,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
it does not exist in
space, time, and matter.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
It has no mass, it
experiences no time,

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and experience itself
traveling no distance.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet we certainly
measure light.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.305 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, we do, in our
frame of reference.

00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is what
Einstein showed.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The faster you go, the
more time and space slow.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.095 align:middle line:84%
And this was realized
back in 1926.

00:06:41.095 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:84%
There were some very interesting
papers written about it.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But nobody knew
what to do with it.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And everybody said, well,
because we cannot travel

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
at the speed of light,
a physical object,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.360 align:middle line:84%
we do not have to
worry about this.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
actually very interesting

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
when we start looking
at consciousness,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
because what we're seeing is
light itself doesn't exist in

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:90%
space, time, or matter.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, when
we look at consciousness

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and we talk about it as
the light of consciousness,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's no accident
we use that word.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
People often talk about the
inner light, consciousness

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
being the light, that
light is the mind.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking John in the
Bible talked about that.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, I have taken,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
I think other people have
taken that to be a metaphor.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.800 align:middle line:84%
If I hear you
correctly, you're saying

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.360 align:middle line:90%
that it's more than a metaphor.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:84%
There's something about
physical light and consciousness

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
that may be a kin, an
identity, not a metaphor.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's
something here.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.952 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a start,
consciousness doesn't--

00:07:37.952 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:90%
isn't in the world of matter.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Consciousness doesn't have mass.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not a physical object.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness I don't
think exists in space and time.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We think it does because
our experience exists

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:90%
in space and time.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
But I think space
and time are part

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of the form that
consciousness takes on

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:90%
to interpret experience.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So space and time are
actually constructs within

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, as is matter.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness itself is
beyond space, time, and matter.

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the light
of the physical world

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
is beyond space,
time, and matter,

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and the light of
consciousness is beyond

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.550 align:middle line:90%
space, time, and matter.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And both are
absolutely fundamental.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.930 align:middle line:84%
The light of
consciousness, I think,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.430 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely the primary basis
of every single experience

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.660 align:middle line:90%
we ever have.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you look in the world of
physics, any exchange of energy

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:84%
anywhere the
universe takes place

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:90%
by the exchange of a quantum.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.773 align:middle line:84%
A quantum of action
is actually a photon,

00:08:35.773 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:90%
different frequencies.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
But all a quantum of
action is is a photon.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:84%
So every single energy
exchange involves light.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So light is
absolutely fundamental

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
to the physical universe
and absolutely fundamental

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:90%
to our own experience.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know what
this means, quite.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
I think it's suggesting there's
something absolutely not

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.570 align:middle line:84%
only fascinating but very
fundamental about light.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, if you want to
put it in spiritual terms,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:84%
let's say that
whatever the divine is,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
the divine essence, as the
divine essence manifests,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.477 align:middle line:84%
the first
manifestation is light,

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:13.560 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a manifestation
in the physical world

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.080 align:middle line:84%
or in the mental world,
that light is the basis.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think this is very
profound what you're saying.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.040 align:middle line:84%
It also happens to be the
basis of the philosophy of one

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.310 align:middle line:84%
of my mentors, Arthur M.
Young, who wrote "The Reflexive

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Universe" and made this point.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But he was criticized by
people who, I don't think,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:90%
understood his view very well.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, he's just
trying to reduce consciousness

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.255 align:middle line:90%
down to the photon.

00:09:37.255 --> 00:09:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
you mean it that way.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.088 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't mean-- no, no, no.

00:09:40.088 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.915 align:middle line:84%
I think it's showing
something very profound

00:09:43.915 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of
the universe, which

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:90%
has to do with light.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's not reducing
consciousness down at all.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- for me,
it's doing the opposite.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:84%
It's saying consciousness is
primary, it's something very,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:90%
very, very significant.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And we shouldn't ignore
it or try to reduce it.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we think of as
light isn't really something--

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:90%
it's not a particle.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystery yet in itself.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And we may never
actually know it.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.520 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
wave-particle duality.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
If you look at light from
its own point of view--

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and I would suggest that's the
best way to look at light, not

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:90%
from our point of view--

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:84%
light from its own point of
view doesn't travel anywhere,

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.270 align:middle line:90%
doesn't take any time to do so.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
Why does it even need to
be a wave or a particle?

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It has no problem because it
doesn't cross space or time.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Only what happens is, in
our world, at our speeds,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.807 align:middle line:84%
we separate the point
of emission and point

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:90%
of absorption of a photon.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We separate them
in space and time.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And so our experience is
that they are separated.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And so then the question
arises, how did it

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:90%
get from there to there?

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.230 align:middle line:84%
But that's a false
question, because

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.605 align:middle line:84%
from light's
perspective, which I

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
think is the true
perspective, it

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:90%
never actually went anywhere.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And that also explains
the speed of light,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.670 align:middle line:84%
because from our perspective,
we say, how did we

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
get from here to there?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it must have
had a speed because we

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
see there's the distance
of 186,000 miles, say,

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.230 align:middle line:90%
and there's one second of time.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I think what the
speed of light is,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
and why it's always
constant, it's

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle line:84%
the ratio of creation
of space and time.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So when we separate the
beginning and end of a photon,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
we create 186,000 miles of
space for every second of time.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter, we're going
to take a break.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.806 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:35.694 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:35.694 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove, your host.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Peter Russell,
author of "Waking Up In Time."

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.850 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the mystery of light.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And Peter, I'd like you
to repeat the thought

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.440 align:middle line:84%
you had there right
before our break,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.920 align:middle line:84%
because it struck me as
incredibly profound and really

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:84%
a bit difficult to grasp,
outside of our normal frame

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.147 align:middle line:90%
of reference.

00:12:05.147 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
>> What I was saying is if
you look at the universe from

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
light's point of view and
what the special theory

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
of relativity says, from
light's point of view,

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:84%
time has slowed to a standstill
and space has contracted to 0.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So from light's point of
view, it doesn't actually

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
travel anywhere, and it
takes no time to do it.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So light's point of view is
it's just an exchange of energy,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of a quantum of action, across
two points in space which

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.730 align:middle line:90%
are touching.

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
In our frame of
reference, by which I

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.350 align:middle line:84%
mean us moving
very, very slowly,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:90%
those points get stretched out.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the light
starts here and ends up there.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.443 align:middle line:84%
The faster you go,
the closer and closer

00:12:46.443 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
those two points become,
until at the speed of light

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.568 align:middle line:90%
they become coincident.

00:12:49.568 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:84%
But at our speeds, they're
stretched out to their maximum.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's as if we're talking
about the interface between

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:84%
the realm of eternity,
outside of time,

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and the realm of time and space.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.220 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.030 align:middle line:90%
In a way, yes.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I think you could say
light exists in eternity.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:84%
So what we observe
is space and time.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We observe, then, that light
has crossed that space and time,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:90%
and has taken--

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
has done so in the ratio of
186,000 miles per second.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.520 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting is that
isn't actually a speed at all

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
because light doesn't need
to have a speed itself.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.750 align:middle line:90%
See, it never travels anywhere.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
What that is is
the ratio in which

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:84%
we create the experience
of space and time.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is what is a
fixed law of the universe,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
that space and time
are always created

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:84%
in the ratio 186,000 miles of
space for every second of time.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:90%
And that is what is constant.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a constant speed.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It appears to us as
a constant speed.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a constant
ratio of creation.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
>> The space-time ratio.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.063 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein was onto that,
because he was saying,

00:13:53.063 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:90%
underneath is the space--

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
the real reality is the
space-time continuum,

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
out of which emerge the
experience of space and time.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And the experience
of space and time

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
always emerge in
that fixed ratio.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you also suggest
that light is related

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.040 align:middle line:90%
to consciousness.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
One might, say
since light is just

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.660 align:middle line:84%
about the most fundamental
of all what we call particles

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
in physics, that if light is
associated with consciousness,

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:84%
then consciousness
permeates everything.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I was saying was
that the light of physics

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.335 align:middle line:84%
bears very, very, very
close similarities

00:14:32.335 --> 00:14:33.700 align:middle line:90%
to the light of consciousness.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think they are
indicative of a far

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:84%
more profound connection
than we realize.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying they're
the same thing.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.920 align:middle line:84%
But just as light
is everywhere, I

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
believe consciousness
is everywhere.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't think consciousness
evolved at a certain stage

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:90%
of evolution.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
I think dogs and things
are clearly conscious.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.120 align:middle line:90%
They have experiences.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I think as you go down
the evolutionary tree,

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness may
get dimmer and dimmer.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think there's
any point where it started.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
I think it goes all
the way down, just gets

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:84%
fainter and fainter and fainter
and fainter and fainter.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that consciousness
is fundamental to the universe

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
and is in everything.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It is everything.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:84%
But only when the
physical world has

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
evolved to the sort of
qualities that we have,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
the complexities that we
have, does consciousness

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.590 align:middle line:84%
evolve to take on the
very complex forms

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
in our own minds.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, in the first interview
of this two-part series,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.800 align:middle line:84%
you referred to consciousness
as if it were a movie projector

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:90%
without any film in it.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, the normal mind is
the image on the screen.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Pure consciousness is like
the light behind the film.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness
is the light that

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
is shining in the
mind, which takes

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.860 align:middle line:84%
on all the different forms and
qualities of our experience.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the mystics have
referred to consciousness this

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:90%
way in most traditions.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's interesting.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Around the world, you see very,
very similar descriptions.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And these are people who've
explored consciousness

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:90%
firsthand.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:90%
They're mystics.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:84%
They're basically people
who through meditation

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.800 align:middle line:84%
or other forms of
internal practice

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
have looked at the nature of
consciousness in their mind.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
They haven't gone out
and studied out there

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
by studying people's
brainwaves, which

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%
is what science does today.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:84%
They've gone inside,
which I think

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is the real laboratory
of consciousness,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:84%
and explored their own
processes in incredible depth.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And from that comes the
various conclusions.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of these is that
everything is a manifestation

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So that there is a sense
in which the whole universe,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:90%
the whole universe is within us.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And this many of
these people say.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
If you read their
descriptions, they talk about,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
I am the universe.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:90%
I am the stars.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
The whole world
revolves within me.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.212 align:middle line:90%
Now, we try and understand that.

00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:51.670 align:middle line:84%
We think, well, that's either
a very egotistical statement,

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.040 align:middle line:84%
or they're having some
delusion that they are--

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:90%
the whole universe is in them.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They are not talking about the
physical universe as this thing

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:90%
out here.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.849 align:middle line:84%
What they are talking about is
the universe as they know it.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the known universe
is known in consciousness.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And so in that sense,
everything is within me,

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
because it's within
my experience.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Einstein, when
he developed his theory

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:21.550 align:middle line:84%
of relativity, he engaged in the
thought experiment of imagining

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:84%
what it would be like
to travel on a photon.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And if a photon could
speak, wouldn't a photon

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:84%
say something to the effect
that I am the universe,

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
meaning the physical universe
is all contained within?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not sure.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
A photon wouldn't
have time to speak.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.750 align:middle line:84%
A photon doesn't exist
in space and time.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:90%
It is a moment.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.640 align:middle line:90%
It is just a zero point of time.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Time exists outside
of the photon.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But for that photon, it
doesn't actually exist in time.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It is just a moment,
a zero moment.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> If time exists
outside of the photon,

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
then you're suggesting
that there are two realms,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:84%
a realm of time and
a realm of no time.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yes.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of
consciousness as well.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
When you go deep
into meditation,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
you reach that timeless state,
which I think many people have

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:17.350 align:middle line:84%
experienced, where you
don't-- time disappears.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can be there for
10 minutes, 10 hours.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just you have that
experience of timelessness.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet in our daily
world, consciousness

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.420 align:middle line:84%
takes on clearly
the forms of time.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
We are aware very much now
of the passing of time.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's something as
a parapsychologist that really

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
interests me, which
is precognition,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of our
consciousness to know things

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.210 align:middle line:84%
that have not yet happened,
that would seem to be physically

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:90%
impossible to know.

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a whole other
question and how that happens,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.658 align:middle line:84%
when it happens, if it does
happen, which cases are true.

00:18:51.658 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
questions about it.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I will attest
that it does happen.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.850 align:middle line:90%
I've seen it happen.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
It's been well documented in
hundreds of laboratory studies.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And it would seem to me that
your description here of light

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:84%
would provide, not a
mechanism, but a foundation

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
within which precognition
can seem to be more normal.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> It certainly shows that it's
not so far out as one would

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.260 align:middle line:90%
initially expect.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it offers a
simple explanation for it.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I think we get caught
up sometimes in the belief

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that our current state
of knowledge is the end,

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.777 align:middle line:84%
and there are so many
things we don't know.

00:19:31.777 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we just have to go back 100
years ago to look at the world

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.200 align:middle line:90%
view of people then.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:90%
Compare that to today.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Or go back 2,000 years ago
to what the Greeks understood

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
about the world and
realize they thought

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:90%
they had it all sorted out.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And for us to think we know
how the world works is I

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:90%
think the grossest arrogance.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think if I were to
try and provide a mechanism

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:84%
for you as to how precognition
could possibly occur,

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:90%
that would be very arrogant.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that we'll
ever be able to do that.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.168 align:middle line:84%
>> It may not even
involve mechanisms.

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's my point.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> We're caught
in a mechanistic--

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:05.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:90%
--mode of thinking.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The very need for a mechanism
is part of the problem.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But to suggest, as I
think you have suggested,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
that all is already contained
within consciousness,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness partakes
of a realm which is completely

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
outside of time, would suggest
to me it could have access,

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:90%
therefore, to any point in time.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps it's just biological
conditioning that keeps it

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:90%
from happening more often.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.070 align:middle line:84%
What it suggests to me
as our current world view

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is so small compared to the
immensity of what is obviously

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:90%
going on in the universe.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.780 align:middle line:84%
And the current world
view cannot understand it,

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
cannot encompass it.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Try as we may, we
just get-- our minds,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.128 align:middle line:84%
like I'm sure many
viewers' minds are

00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:90%
stretching at the moment.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.023 align:middle line:84%
All that happens is
our minds go, what?

00:20:50.023 --> 00:20:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're
limited, of course,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:90%
by our cultural conditioning.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I think we're also limited
by our biological--

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly--

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:56.880 align:middle line:90%
--conditioning.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --because we're sitting here
functioning within physical

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
organisms which don't move
at the speed of light,

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.423 align:middle line:84%
and we have all
that conditioning.

00:21:04.423 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think we are forced to just
see the world through this very

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:90%
narrow perspective.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's probably fair to
assume that under favorable

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
conditions, the human race
will evolve to a point where

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.660 align:middle line:84%
consciousness will transcend
both cultural and biological

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:90%
conditioning.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.947 align:middle line:84%
>> This is why I think the
mystics are so important,

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
the great saints and yogis and
sages which have been dotted

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:90%
through time.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
I think they are the heralds of
what is to come for humanity.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:84%
They are just little
individuals who

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
have discovered the true
nature of consciousness.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.970 align:middle line:84%
When I say little, I mean
just a few individuals.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think where we are going
is that sort of experience

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:90%
becoming the norm.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.650 align:middle line:84%
That I think is our evolutionary
potential as a species.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, those great spiritual
geniuses and heroes and saints

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:90%
can serve as role models and--

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:90%
>> --templates.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And their experience
can probably

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
become more accessible
to more people.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
is happening today.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.572 align:middle line:90%
More and more people--

00:22:00.572 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I think for the first time ever
in the history of humanity,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.210 align:middle line:84%
you have millions and
millions of people

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.500 align:middle line:90%
wanting to explore this.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.530 align:middle line:84%
They are getting on with
their life and work,

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time they're
studying meditation or yoga

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.030 align:middle line:84%
or working on themselves
in one way or another.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're not reaching at
the moment such depths as many

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of the great
mystics, but there's

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.020 align:middle line:84%
this movement in that direction,
this groundswell which

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, your work is very
inspiring in that regard,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Peter, because you're showing
that that path towards a higher

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, towards an
awakening can occur through

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
meditation, can occur
through science,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.690 align:middle line:84%
can occur through a more
enlightened business practice.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's all coming
together at this time

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
and all moving in
the same direction.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Peter Russell, I regard
you as a role model in that

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.330 align:middle line:90%
regard.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You're very clear and
articulate about issues that are

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.645 align:middle line:90%
hard for most people to grasp.

00:22:49.645 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a pleasure.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being with us.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.870 align:middle line:90%
