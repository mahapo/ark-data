00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to continue
our exploration of the Sanskrit

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.010 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:10%
With me is Dean Brown,
physicist, philosopher,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.720 align:middle line:10%
and Sanskrit scholar who has
translated both the Upanishads

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.100 align:middle line:10%
and the yoga sutras.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dean.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to be here.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good to
be with you again.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:10%
In our earlier
discussion, when we

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.620 align:middle line:10%
talked about the Vedic
tradition, the Sanskrit

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:10%
tradition, we discussed many
elegant metaphysical ideas,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.620 align:middle line:10%
such as the idea that
Atman equals Brahman

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:10%
that the very essence of
the individual human being

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:10%
is the same as the
totality of the universe,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:10%
as the supreme deity.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But when we look
at the yoga sutras,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
it seems as if here, we
find something very unique--

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.310 align:middle line:84%
not only an elegant
philosophy but a technology

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
by which we can achieve
these remarkable insights

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and integrate them
into our lives.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, the yoga sutras
are a how-to manual.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Given this cosmology
that we've talked about

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.610 align:middle line:10%
and what the universe
is like and what

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:10%
you're like in it that
we get from the Veda,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.930 align:middle line:10%
then how shall we proceed?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And the Patanjali
sutras are a manual

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:90%
of just how to get there.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Very practical.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And as I understand it, one
of the key insights is very

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.100 align:middle line:90%
simple.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.920 align:middle line:84%
By quieting the
mind, by reducing

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the chatter of the mind,
when the mind is still,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:84%
it can then be a perfect
reflection of reality.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
In Sanskrit, the mind is
called the chit or the chitta.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And the thoughts and sensations
are waves in the mind.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like creating your
quantum mechanics of waves

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:90%
and physics, wave mechanics.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:90%
The mind operates by waves.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.890 align:middle line:90%
These are called the Vritti.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have Vritti
and the chitta.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is the process of
stilling the waves in the mind,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
so the mind can be the perfect
reflection of the universe

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.845 align:middle line:90%
and everything that's in it.

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And we talked in our earlier
program about the concept

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of Ritam-bhara pragya,
the realm of perfection,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.490 align:middle line:84%
which is a level of
consciousness, in effect.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's even
beyond consciousness.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the place where
things are perfect.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness can
access these, and in a way,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.020 align:middle line:84%
if we take a certain
definition of consciousness,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that would also include
this field of ideals.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But one apprehends the
perfect by stilling

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.110 align:middle line:84%
all the waves in the mind
and pointing the mind

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.480 align:middle line:90%
toward the object of attention.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now in the yoga sutras,
there are various stages

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
in the development of a yogi.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there are many
stages and many paths.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.840 align:middle line:84%
In the yoga sutras,
there are four stages

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:84%
called, in that book,
pada, pedal, foot.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.970 align:middle line:90%
A pada is a foot.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.370 align:middle line:90%
So there are four feet.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
The last one is Kavya,
which is usually translated

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.520 align:middle line:90%
as liberation, freedom.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But the word really means
isolation, aloneness.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.730 align:middle line:84%
If you achieve total
isolation in the universe

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
with no connection to anything
else, then you're free.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The condition in Sanskrit
is called Samadhi.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.760 align:middle line:84%
You achieve a place in your
mind where there are no waves.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
You are not connected
to anything else.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:90%
And then you transcend.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, if I
understand it correctly,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
you're free from
karmic attachments.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:10%
Karma is a Sanskrit word
meaning work, to do something.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:10%
Your karma is what
you have done.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:10%
So the scars on your body are
results of what you've done.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:84%
And to be free of
karmic attachment

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.920 align:middle line:84%
means to be free of anything
you've ever done before,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.770 align:middle line:84%
which means that
you have achieved

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.623 align:middle line:84%
that state of Tabula Rasa,
where you're absolutely nothing.

00:05:38.623 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You've, in effect--

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.248 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not necessarily
a desirable fate.

00:05:41.248 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --you've completed
your work, your life.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You've completed all--
you've transcended all memory

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.500 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you've
completed your mission in life,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.510 align:middle line:84%
but it means you're
free from all memories.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.113 align:middle line:84%
>> And you used
the word "scar--"

00:06:03.113 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not
necessarily desirable.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --earlier, which I believe
relates to the Sanskrit term,

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.550 align:middle line:90%
samskara.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Samskara is a scar, yes.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.150 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get
our modern word, scar.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I understand
that concept correctly,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
the notion is that we are all
constrained by these samskaras.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:90%
They represent our conditioning.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I don't want
to seem like negative.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a positive.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
If you've learned something,
you've conditioned yourself.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So all learning, all education
is a kind of a conditioning.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's still-- to
re-arrive at this stage

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:84%
where you have no
samskaras, no conditioning

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.600 align:middle line:84%
is at the babe-like state again
where there is no memories.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you're fresh
for something new.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's very delicate.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.795 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
throw off all karma.

00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
You want to take
advantage of what

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:90%
you've gained at this point.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:90%
You want to have memories.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, you
want to be able to erase them.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, we think of yoga as
often being equated with Hatha

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:10%
yoga or the physical
stretching exercises.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Many kinds of yoga, yes.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Hatha yoga does
make you feel good.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
It's good to stretch
and do the asanas.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.715 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:07:26.715 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Or postures.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Postures, yeah.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, asanas.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Asanas comes from to sit
down, a seat to yourself.

00:07:33.525 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Sittings.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:84%
But other kinds of yoga are
doing good deeds, Bhakti yoga,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:55.170 align:middle line:84%
saying prayers, life of
reverence, Jnana yoga,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:84%
thinking about this or that and
achieving union-- yoga means

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.240 align:middle line:90%
union with God.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It'd be the equivalent
of our word, yoke."

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yoke, yes.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>> We yoke the oxen together,
and it's a way of attaching.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And I yoke myself
to God in yoga.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:84%
But the paths of yoga include
the intellectual and good

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:middle line:84%
deeds, exercises,
actions of many sorts.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And the term you
mentioned earlier, Jnana--

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Jnana.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Jnana, the yoga of knowledge,
it's related to our word,

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:90%
"knowledge."

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Jnana is the root of
our word, to know, knowledge.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.749 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why "know" has that
funny spelling with the K.

00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:90%
>> K, yeah.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Gnosis-- G in gnosis.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
To know something, to comprehend
something, to really master it.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So there is a sense in which,
when we look at the Sanskrit

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
traditions, we get to the very
essential original meanings

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
of many of the
words that we use.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, especially in
our English or European

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:90%
or Indo-European culture.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
We get back to the
clear original meanings

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of our everyday
dialect in Sanskrit.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So for example, the
discussion that you and I are

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
now having is probably,
in a very real sense,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.230 align:middle line:90%
a form of yoga.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.570 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, indeed.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We're studying the
origins of our words

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and crystallizing our
thoughts by so doing.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why Veda is a science,
because it leads to precision.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And the technique of
meditation is one that it's not

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
just for relaxation
and for health.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.850 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a very
precise way of attuning

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:90%
one's mind so that--

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.355 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fastening
the mind, yeah.

00:09:53.355 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> --these abstract metaphysical
concepts become like workable

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:90%
tools.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in one way, it's a
way of creating something.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
I can create something
by putting my mind on it,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on it, by allowing
the thought waves of my mind

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
to go out and grasp the
object of attention,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.390 align:middle line:84%
by taking the perfect form
in the Ritam Bhara Pragyan,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and expressing it in
nature, in Prakriti.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.688 align:middle line:84%
It is the way to
accomplish anything.

00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Dean, we're going
to take a short break.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.495 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:42.495 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
the Sanskrit tradition

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.790 align:middle line:84%
with Dean Brown, a theoretical
physicist, Sanskrit scholar,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and translator of the
Upanishads and the yoga sutras.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:10%
Dean, one of the really
interesting things to me

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:10%
about the yoga
sutras is the idea

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.190 align:middle line:10%
that there are the siddhis,
the powers of the mind that

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:10%
become activated through
the practice of yoga

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.480 align:middle line:10%
and meditation.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:10%
Not only does the yogi
see reality clearly

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:10%
both in its physical and
metaphysical dimensions,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:10%
but many abilities that we would
call in the West psychic powers

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.930 align:middle line:10%
or the gifts of
the spirit are also

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:10%
available through
yoga discipline.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because they're
available through the mind

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:84%
itself, and the yoga discipline
enhances the faculties

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and the capabilities
of the mind.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:84%
All mental powers can
be accessed and improved

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
through the practice of yoga.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Because to the yogis,
the mind over and above--

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.910 align:middle line:84%
you use the term the
"chit," the thoughts,

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
the activity of the
mind is one thing,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.920 align:middle line:84%
but the mind itself
contains this activity.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's equated, if I recall
correctly, with the divine.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, in Veda, everything
is divine in the end.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:26.960 align:middle line:10%
And the mind or consciousness
is the ultimate fabric

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:10%
of the divine.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:10%
So by gaining control of the
mind or your mind or my mind,

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:10%
we access everything.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything unfolds
from the mind, in effect.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything unfolds
from the mind.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Now that isn't such a strange
idea for modern psychology

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:90%
that everything is in the mind.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
But in the Veda, it's a very
practical and useful concept

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and pursuit.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's an idea that, today,
even physicists are taking

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:90%
seriously.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
The way a physicist thinks
about his experiment

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:90%
controls the way it comes out.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, Indeed, especially
in quantum mechanics.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
The expectation of
the experimenter

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.270 align:middle line:90%
conditions his result.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So perhaps it's even fair to
say that we're living in an age

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
in which physicists are becoming
yogis and other scientists.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, physicists
certainly understand,

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.160 align:middle line:84%
especially in the 20th century
and now in the 21st century.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They understand that the
attitude of the experimenter

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do with the
result that he's going to get.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And but the discipline of
physics is one of beginning

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:84%
to inquire about ultimate,
because physicists used to be

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
focusing in on solid,
sensory, empirical reality.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Now it's come to the point where
physicists are sort of required

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
to ask about
metaphysical absolutes,

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:14.910 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the mind, the
nature of consciousness.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'd say old physics
was interested in that, too.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle was a physicist,
and the old Greeks certainly

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:84%
were interested in these
metaphysical dimensions, too.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
But modern physics,
which is based so

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
squarely on quantum
mechanics, has

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:84%
got to be very sensitive to
what we think about our results.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Modern quantum
mechanics, for instance,

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
talks about non-locality,
that an event

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
can be perceived everywhere in
the universe at the same time

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
if quantum entities are
entrained or related

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
to the same event, share
the same quantum numbers.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a methodology
whereby physics and physicists

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:90%
come to this knowledge.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.230 align:middle line:84%
Things like quantum
numbers and quarks,

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.290 align:middle line:84%
as abstract and metaphysical
as they may seem,

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are arrived at through
an empirical method.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now yoga and the yoga
sutras lays out--

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Good point.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>> --what seems to be almost
the equivalent of an empirical

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:35.720 align:middle line:84%
method for arriving at a similar
understanding of the nature

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.890 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's a very
nice point, Jeffrey.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The old Sanskrit practices
are totally empirical.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.640 align:middle line:84%
You try this, and this works,
and this works, and this works.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
that's what modern--

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.790 align:middle line:84%
any science is empirical and
particularly modern physics.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
it's very abstract.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Empiricism does not
rule out abstractions.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It leads to abstractions.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It necessarily leads
to abstractions, yes.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Everything in physics
that's really fundamental

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:90%
is abstract, like energy.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Energy is an abstraction.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Quantum numbers are
abstractions, quarks.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in physics is
really where it's at.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:90%
But abstractly, it is.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
We have to live with the
Heisenberg indeterminacy,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the problem that if
something happens here,

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:84%
it has effects everywhere
else, probabilistically.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems to me that the
paradoxes of physics are very

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
much akin to some of
the paradoxes one runs

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:84%
into in the Sanskrit
and the Vedic tradition.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:84%
One of the Upanishads that you
translated, for example, says--

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
and we get this in other
spiritual traditions--

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.890 align:middle line:84%
if you think you know
the absolute, you don't.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If you don't think
you know it, you do.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's sort of like
the Heisenberg indeterminacy.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.780 align:middle line:10%
If you think you know
where it's at, you don't.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.599 align:middle line:10%
But if you don't think
it's exactly here,

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:10%
then you're probably right.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:19.166 align:middle line:10%
>> Now in yoga, I don't know
if the same idea applies.

00:17:19.166 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.890 align:middle line:90%
But there is a--

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:90%
there are paradoxes in yoga.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
That is one tries to
become enlightened,

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
but the one who is trying
will never be the one who--

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> --achieves enlightenment.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And that which is
very small, the Atman,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:90%
is that which is very large.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.605 align:middle line:84%
We have those paradoxes
in quantum mechanics.

00:17:42.605 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:84%
A wave is not a particle,
but it is a particle.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
It leads us to the fore value of
logic of the ancient Sanskrits.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:90%
This is true.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Its opposite is
simultaneously true.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a wave or a particle.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:90%
It is neither, but it is both.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
These fore values of logics that
are so essential in modern chip

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:84%
design, for instance, were
all worked out very carefully

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.190 align:middle line:84%
by the Sanskrit logicians
thousands and thousands

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:10%
>> So there is a sense in
which the ancient yogis,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:10%
by following these metaphysics
and these disciplines

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:10%
of concentration and meditation,
were acting in very much

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:10%
of the same spirit is as
our modern entrepreneurs

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:10%
and scientists.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, sure, especially
logic designers that we have

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:90%
nowadays.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And I should add for
benefit of our viewers,

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
you yourself designed one of the
first computer chips, the Z80.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I was part of the
team that did that, yes.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So while we think
superficially that the culture

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
of yoga is very distant
from another age,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
from another continent, it's
actually something that is very

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
meaningful, can
be well integrated

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.610 align:middle line:84%
into a technological, a
scientific world view.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's timeless.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And because it's timeless, it
worked then, and it works now,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:90%
and it will work in the future.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.200 align:middle line:84%
We're dealing with
things that don't

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.910 align:middle line:84%
have any particular reference
to a certain culture or time

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.470 align:middle line:90%
or situation.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.330 align:middle line:90%
These things are always true.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:90%
They work for the ancient yogis.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They work for modern
physicists and logic designers.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
They also work
very nicely, thank

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:84%
you, a million years or
50 million years from now.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:10%
>> And I guess it's also fair to
say that the fundamental truths

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.600 align:middle line:10%
that you find in the Vedic
tradition and the Sanskrit

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:10%
tradition in yoga are not
necessarily different than

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:10%
the deep truths you might
find in Christianity, Judaism,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.820 align:middle line:10%
the American Indian
tradition, shamanism,

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.340 align:middle line:10%
Polynesian religions.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:10%
>> If we take these
things as cultures,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:10%
if we talk about Polynesia and
Christianity and so on, if we

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:10%
say that's a culture, then the
deep truth in each of these

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.610 align:middle line:10%
cultures is always the same.

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't say that Christianity
itself has a truth to it.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But as a culture, there is truth
within it, or the Polynesians,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:90%
and it's always the same.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a variant.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in Sanskrit,
though, in the Vedas,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.170 align:middle line:84%
one might say there
is a truth to it.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if the Vedas
are expressed in algorithms.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:90%
Atman equals Brahman.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's more explicit.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an equation.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:10%
The other traditions
aren't so explicit.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.200 align:middle line:10%
>> That's right.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:10%
That's why I'm so happy with the
Vedic studies is that they're

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:10%
so up front with these facts
you can find in any culture,

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:10%
but you have to dig for them.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you've found
it in some other culture,

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
you've probably had to
bring in Sanskrit words

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:90%
to express yourself.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it strikes me that
the philosophy of the Vedic

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.755 align:middle line:84%
tradition that's called Vedanta
is among the most rigorous

00:21:17.755 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
of the philosophical traditions
from the point of view of pure

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.070 align:middle line:84%
logic, of anything we'll
find on the planet.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I do believe that
Advaita Vedanta,

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:90%
which is its full name--

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:90%
Advaita means not two.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.150 align:middle line:84%
It is the wave and
the particle are not

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:90%
two in quantum mechanics.

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the most
advanced, sophisticated

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.300 align:middle line:84%
statement of philosophy
and metaphysics

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:90%
that the world has produced.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And the word "not two" kind
of gets at the essence of it.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's neither two,
and or is it not two.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.300 align:middle line:90%
>> So the two of us are really--

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.177 align:middle line:90%
>> We're not two.

00:21:58.177 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> But we're not not two either.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> But we're not not two, yeah.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Now that's good
old Sanskrit logic.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
It's also good old Buddhist
logic, but Buddha was a yogi.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And I suppose every
mystic, in some sense,

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.080 align:middle line:84%
is a yogi regardless
of their culture.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Every mystic strives
to be in union with God.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the term "god" may not
be meaningful for the mystic,

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:30.380 align:middle line:84%
but he's still in
union with the cosmos.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the Buddha, for
example, equated god with pure

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.350 align:middle line:90%
nothingness.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Dean Brown, it's been a great
pleasure sharing this program

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.710 align:middle line:84%
with you, getting at the essence
of the Sanskrit tradition,

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.790 align:middle line:90%
the yoga sutras.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being with me.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's over so soon.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, these are subjects
that we could be discussing

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.160 align:middle line:10%
eternally, Dean.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a pleasure.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.550 align:middle line:10%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:90%
