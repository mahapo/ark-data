00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:16.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to
examine the nature of time

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship between
time and the human mind.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.650 align:middle line:84%
With me in the studio
is Terence McKenna,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:84%
a specialist in shamanistic
traditions and also

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%
hallucinogens.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Terence is the co-author
with his brother Dennis

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of "Psilocybin, The Magic
Mushroom Growers Guide,"

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and also "The Invisible
Landscape, Time, Hallucinogens,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and the I Ching."

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he is the developer
of a computer software program

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.440 align:middle line:84%
called Timewave Zero
and is the founder

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of Botanical Dimensions, a
non-profit organization devoted

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
to preserving hallucinogenic
plants as used

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.420 align:middle line:84%
by native peoples
throughout the world.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Terence.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you again.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, shamanistic
peoples and early peoples

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
entire world have all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:84%
been involved in systems
of what we call divination.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be throwing
bones or using the I Ching

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
or looking at the entrails of
animals or clouds of smoke.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But each system
seemed to involve

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
some sort of a
unique way of linking

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.720 align:middle line:84%
the human mind with
the very nature of time

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
itself in order to
understand cycles of time

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:84%
and understand, perhaps
even to predict, the future.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, it's certainly
true that pre-literate

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
and Aboriginal peoples have
had an obsession with time.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
However, it's an
obsession shared

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
by the historical
societies as well.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Time seems to be the
dimension about which we

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
have the greatest anxiety,
perhaps because it's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:84%
the dimension into which we
see with the least clarity.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Numerous peoples
throughout the world

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
have dealt with
this lack of clarity

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
as far as time is
concerned by developing

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.690 align:middle line:84%
various methods of divination
or sortilege, as it's called.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.155 align:middle line:84%
The Maya, to this day,
practice sortilege

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of a very complicated sort in
the highlands of Guatemala.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
African peoples have
complex divinatory systems.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And we don't have to even
mention the enormous sales

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of the I Ching and Tarot decks
and astrology products here

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the I Ching is the
divinatory system ne plus

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:90%
ultra.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
It seems to very
early have captured

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
the imagination of Western
orientalist James Legge

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.320 align:middle line:90%
and Richard Wilhelm.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Their translations made it
available to the Western world.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And the psychologist Carl Jung
in inventing and discussing

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon that he
called synchronicity

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:84%
popularized the I
Ching by using it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
as an example of this
particular phenomenon.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know in the
literature today,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:84%
especially in
transpersonal psychology,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
there are many psychotherapists
who use the I Ching

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.130 align:middle line:84%
as a regular part
of their practice.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:84%
And parapsychologists have
found striking evidence

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that the coincidences of
tossing the coins in the I Ching

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:90%
do have psychological validity.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, the thing which
amazed me about the I Ching

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
and caused me to become so
deeply involved with it is this

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:90%
fact that it seems to work.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Against all rational
expectation,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.160 align:middle line:84%
the carrying out of this
random, ritualistic activity

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:84%
seems then to give a reading,
which is, in fact, applicable

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
to the unique situation.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jung's
explanation of this was

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.810 align:middle line:84%
what he called
acausal connectedness,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:90%
or synchronicity.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
This was simply the idea
that it was possible

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
for there to be a
coincidence of congruence

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
between an internal state,
a psychological state,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:90%
and an exterior event.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
An obvious example
of this would be

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:84%
you think of someone you
haven't thought of for years

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and an hour later in the mail
a letter arrives from them.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And Jung was fascinated by these
kinds of apparent coordinations

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:84%
of the interiorized
psychic sphere

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and the exterior
three-dimensional objective

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:84%
My approach went somewhat
deeper than Jung's in that

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.790 align:middle line:84%
I felt that I had looked
at many divinatory systems

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
with the notion
that I was looking

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
at artifacts of culture,
productions of the human mind

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
that were, to a large
degree, arbitrary.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:84%
My involvement with
the I Ching led me

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
very slowly and reluctantly
to the conclusion

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
that this was not simply a
product of a cultural mentality

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
or the stance of a particular
people in a time and a place,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:84%
but rather that the ancient
Chinese had somehow gotten

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
a leg up, even on
modern physics,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.910 align:middle line:84%
and had produced a
theory about time that

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, objectively
possible to correlate

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
with our own experience, in
other words, a theory of time

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.350 align:middle line:84%
much more akin to a
physicist's description of it

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
than a shaman's
description of it.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned
in your introduction

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
this Timewave Zero software
that we've developed.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.850 align:middle line:84%
What we've done is simply to
formalize the notion of the Tao

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to make a deep study
of the mathematics

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
inherent in the structure of
the sequence of the I Ching.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:84%
See, most people are quite
familiar with the fact

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that the I Ching is
composed of hexagrams.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:90%
Hexagrams have six lines.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:90%
They may be broken.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:90%
They may be unbroken.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Less well known is
the fact that there

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.860 align:middle line:84%
is a very ancient tradition,
even before the Han Dynasty,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of a particular sequence
being the correct sequence.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
King Wen sequence.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And while it has been agreed
upon by all scholars commenting

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.720 align:middle line:84%
on the matter that the King Wen
sequence is somehow primary,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.100 align:middle line:84%
no one had ever explained
how it was ordered.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean the order of
hexagrams from 1 to 64?

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Why is the first one the
hexagram with all solid lines.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Why is the second one the
hexagram with all broken lines,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on?

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I carried out exhaustive
mathematical analysis

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
of the properties of
the King Wen sequence

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and reached a number
of conclusions, such

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:90%
as it is not a random sequence.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It was very, very
carefully constructed

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
to conserve certain
mathematical goals.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.630 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
number of lines

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:84%
that break as you transit
from one hexagram to another

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is arranged and
controlled in such a way

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that when you're all done,
you have a ratio of even

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to odd of 3 to 4.

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Yet, this is achieved without
any breakages, first order

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.428 align:middle line:84%
of different breakages
of magnitude 5.

00:08:05.428 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're beginning
to lose me a little bit.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, what this all
means very simply is that

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
the King Wen sequence
was constructed by minds,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:84%
the equal of research
mathematicians working

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:90%
in the world today.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It sort of reminds me of
the builders of the great Greek

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.830 align:middle line:84%
temples who used the
mystical rectangle.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Proportion and symmetry seems
to be the central concern here.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
You see, we have inherited from
our fascination with Eastern

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:90%
philosophy the idea of Tao.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And Tao in the East
is a concept which

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.030 align:middle line:84%
antedates the
introduction of Buddhism

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
into China by many,
many centuries.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Tao is the notion of a
flux, which comes and goes,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
a transient medium,
which builds structures

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.090 align:middle line:84%
up and pulls them
apart according

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:90%
to its internal dynamic.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, because these notions
were introduced to the West

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:10%
by mystics and
philosophers and people

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.440 align:middle line:10%
with an interest
in metaphysics, it

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:10%
wasn't immediately grasped
that a philosophy of this sort

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:10%
could be a
mathematical formalism,

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.800 align:middle line:10%
that if we're talking about a
medium, which comes and goes,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:10%
we're talking about a wave
mechanical phenomenon.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, science in the West
for the past 150 years

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.610 align:middle line:84%
has developed a powerful
set of techniques

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.780 align:middle line:84%
for dealing with
wave phenomenon.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.160 align:middle line:10%
>> And you seem to be suggesting
then that the 64 hexagrams

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:10%
of the I Ching in their
mathematical relationship,

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:10%
one to the other as you
go through the sequence,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.410 align:middle line:10%
describes a waveform.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.620 align:middle line:84%
>> A waveform which is
experienced in the world

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
by human beings as
time and history.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:90%
You see, it's almost as though--

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
in Western science, we we're
pretty confident that there

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:17.075 align:middle line:84%
are approximately 100 elements,
physical elements to matter--

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right,
different atoms.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, that
are incommensurable.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:90%
They are somehow primary.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese looked not at
the world of matter, energy,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.060 align:middle line:84%
and space, but
the world of time,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and carried out a
very rigorous analysis

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.710 align:middle line:84%
of their own perception and
discovered to their amazement

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that time is actually
composed of elements.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And as we have then, if
I can extrapolate from what

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
you're saying, the periodic
table of elements in Western

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.550 align:middle line:84%
chemistry, which defines
not just 100 elements,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:84%
but a relationship between
them, cycles and patterns.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Bonding relationships,
that's right.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Families of chemicals--

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So we have, in other words,
families of ways of looking

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:90%
at time.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the hexagrams are the
elements in the Chinese physics

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.860 align:middle line:84%
They created a science that
reinforces primary perceptions

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that we all have, but for
which we have no science.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I'm sure you've
noticed that every day is

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.090 align:middle line:90%
rather like every other day.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, I'm
sure you've also

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
noticed that some
days are radically

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.180 align:middle line:90%
different than others.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this sameness
but different rule

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
applies on all levels
in a temporal hierarchy.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Centuries are rather
like each other,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
and yet occasionally a
century will come along

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.260 align:middle line:90%
that is quite anomalous.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
We call this sameness and
difference nesting fractal.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a new branch
of mathematics.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And quite simply what
the Chinese discovered,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
circa 3,000 BC, was the
fractal nature of time,

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
that the rules of expression
of temporal elements

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:84%
which govern the rise
and fall of dynasties

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:84%
also govern the rise and fall
of love affairs and moods.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you're describing
this in mathematical terms.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to come back and
ask you to define the term

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.790 align:middle line:90%
fractal in a moment.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also curious
about how you

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:84%
seem to be going back and
forth between something

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:84%
purely quantitative and
something qualitative.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's the
interesting thing, you see.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese understood that
these temporal elements

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
were in a sense creating
interference patterns

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
with each other, much in the
way that pure tones struck out

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
on a keyboard will,
through their interference

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.910 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
create a melody.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So that, for instance,
if I find myself

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
sitting in Hadrian's hamburger
joint enjoying a burger,

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
by this theory,
there would actually

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.150 align:middle line:84%
be a relationship
between that act

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and the Emperor Hadrian's
campaigns in Britain

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
before the fall of
the Roman Empire.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
This is the amazing thing which
James Joyce used and understood

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.940 align:middle line:84%
in the construction
of his literary works,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that a man leaving his home
in Dublin on a day in 1905

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:84%
to buy kidneys to
fry for breakfast

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:84%
is in some mysterious
way actually repeating

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
the peregrinations
of the hero Odysseus

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
around the Mediterranean in
his campaign to destroy Troy

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and return to his faithful wife.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Allegory is what
we're talking about.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.840 align:middle line:84%
But allegory has never been
taken seriously by science.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Analogical reasoning
is definitely

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.370 align:middle line:84%
declasse in the
better laboratories.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But in this ancient Chinese
way of looking at things,

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
everything was caused by
its analogical resonances

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
with past and
future events which

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:27.590 align:middle line:84%
had the same temporal
elements embedded in them.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's difficult to go
into this without resorting

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to at least charts and diagrams,
if not puzzling equations

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:90%
with sigmas embedded in them.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.720 align:middle line:84%
>> But let me step
back for a moment,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
because we've been talking very
intensively about the I Ching,

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.520 align:middle line:84%
which is one system, a very
popular and profound and highly

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:90%
respected system, of this type.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.690 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
comparable systems.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.860 align:middle line:90%
For example, there is astrology.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Astrology is another one
of these systems that

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:02.150 align:middle line:84%
seeks to define pre-potent
relationships in nature that

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
can be known by man in order to
ease movement into the future.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:14.510 align:middle line:84%
The success of astrology
I think is borne out

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:90%
by its persistence.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
It is after all one
of the most persistent

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:90%
of human intellectual tools.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It was developed 4,000
or 5,000 years ago.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I think what troubles modern
human beings about astrology

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.470 align:middle line:84%
is that it is a
mechanistic system.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:84%
It's like a group
of cogs and wheels,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.650 align:middle line:84%
which all can turn
at given rates.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, their end
states can be predicted.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> But then we're dealing
again with the nature of nested

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:90%
cycles.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have a strong
intuition of free will.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is why I
think quantum physics

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:01.180 align:middle line:10%
with its probabilistic
notion of determinicy

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:10%
has been so attractive
to the modern mind.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:84%
My conclusions
looking at I Ching

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:12.640 align:middle line:84%
have been that it is not
possible to know the future,

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.350 align:middle line:84%
for if it were possible to know
it, life would be a determinism

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and thinking would be
divorced from meaning.

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.550 align:middle line:90%
And we would be out of business.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But what is possible to
know about the future

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is levels of novelty
which future states

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:39.490 align:middle line:84%
will fulfill by the happenstance
of unpredictable events.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a
formal way of saying,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
we know where the road
goes, but we don't know

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:90%
what the scenery looks like.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I think where the
future is concerned,

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we can know where the road
goes, but we cannot know what

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:90%
the scenery will look like.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
People who have
looked at my theory

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
have said, well, these time
maps that your computer draws,

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to get
rid of the future.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of
fact, a map of time

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:14.050 align:middle line:84%
no more eliminates the future
than a map of South America

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:90%
eliminates the need to go there.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It simply gives one a better
handle on one's destination.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you mentioned
quantum physics a moment ago.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics, there are
a number of different notions

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:90%
related to the future.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.410 align:middle line:10%
One is a notion of
multiple universes.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:10%
Another that--

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:10%
>> The Wheeler notions.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
And another is a notion of
everything is probabilistic,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.410 align:middle line:84%
and while we can't with any
certainty what will happen,

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
we can state with various
probabilities what

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:90%
the possibilities are.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:84%
How does this relate to your
view of time in the future?

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that at
the macrophysical level,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.050 align:middle line:84%
things are rather rigidly
determined with the exception

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%
of living organisms.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.210 align:middle line:84%
So my interpretation
of what biology is

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
and how it relates to
quantum physics and time

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.960 align:middle line:84%
is really biological
systems are amplifiers

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:84%
of quantum mechanical
indeterminacies.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
They are a way of taking the
smidgen of indeterminacy that

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
exists at the
microphysical level

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and coaxing it into a kind of
macrophysical cascade, which

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.800 align:middle line:84%
is life consciousness
and self-reflection.

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And you see this
described in the I Ching.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I think the I Ching
is an abstract modeling system

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.650 align:middle line:84%
for breaking this down to its
simplest elements and then

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
seeing how it works.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're accustomed
to thinking

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of science as linear progress
from the distant past

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:90%
due to the present.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
What I'm suggesting is that at
least in the matter of time,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.840 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese of
the pre-Han period

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
had a much more true
and formally applicable

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
notion of time than
we ourselves do.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
We have failed in our
effort to assimilate time

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
into our physics, because
of our obsession with matter

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.350 align:middle line:90%
and the release of energy.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's some scholars
who suggest that the African

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Yoruba people with their system
of divination called Ifa,

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:84%
which has a cycle I think
of 244 or 264 various myths

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and stories, is even more
sophisticated than the I Ching,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.217 align:middle line:90%
which has only 64.

00:19:39.217 --> 00:19:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Have you looked into that?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.190 align:middle line:90%
>> I have looked into it.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.030 align:middle line:84%
What makes the I Ching
so powerful in my mind

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:50.560 align:middle line:84%
is that it appears to
be an exact analogy

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:90%
to the mechanism of DNA.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There are 64 codons, which
code for amino acids in DNA.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.060 align:middle line:90%
There are 64 hexagrams.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:90%
There are 8 primary hexagram.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.880 align:middle line:84%
There are 8 indispensable
amino acids.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I felt that really the I
Ching is like mankind's best

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.820 align:middle line:84%
shot at this because
it has this reflection

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:84%
in the biological matrix, out
of which consciousness emerged.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, the various
ancient divination systems may

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
all reflect a striving of human
beings towards this intuitive

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.740 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
cyclical nature of time

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship between
mind and the flow of time.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the I Ching
may observe sort

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:84%
of hit the nail on the head
better than the others.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's like looking
at a 17th century description

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.770 align:middle line:84%
of the motion of the planets
or a 20th century description.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:90%
These are basically refinements.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.680 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, I think that
the I Ching represents

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:05.910 align:middle line:84%
a primary perception of the
organization of mind, time,

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'll even tell you how
I think they got a leg up.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I think basically
there is a tradition

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.620 align:middle line:84%
in Central Asia of
the so-called stilling

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
the heart techniques,
vis-a-vis yoga.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.270 align:middle line:84%
These are techniques where
vital functions are suppressed.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Breathing becomes very minimal.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.570 align:middle line:84%
All exterior inputs
are suspended.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
think the Chinese sages

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
who practiced this
form of meditation

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:84%
noticed a flux at the
center of the stillness,

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
which they called Tao,
and which they set out

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to phenomenalogically describe,
not knowing whether it was

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:90%
physics, organism, or deity.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they did not
prejudge this question.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They simply gave a
phenomenological description

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
of the transcendental flux
that they encountered in states

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of deep yogic ecstasy.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.500 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, it
turns out that this

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.330 align:middle line:84%
is the perfect technique
for studying time.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Time is not a
phenomenon where you

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
build machines with
8 kilometer diameters

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:90%
that cost trillions of dollars.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Time is a phenomenon
to be studied

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.740 align:middle line:84%
by attending dinner parties
perhaps or pursuing love

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
affairs or watching the passing
of the seasons, activities much

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.740 align:middle line:84%
more commiserate with our
vision of the Tao sage

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:45.000 align:middle line:84%
than the white coated
scientist of the present world

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:90%
religion of science.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
So really, I think it was
an involvement in organism

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:90%
and in the human experience.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, the
laboratory for studying time

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
would not so much be our
observatories or our systems

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
of quartz clocks, but rather
looking inside of ourselves,

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:05.550 align:middle line:90%
observing our own organism.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly precise,
and the workings of our own

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.200 align:middle line:90%
psychology.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:10%
To my mind, the
greatest commentator

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:10%
on time in the 20th century
after Albert Einstein

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:10%
would certainly have
to be Marcel Proust.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Proust understood
more about the time

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.270 align:middle line:84%
we experience, and was
able to communicate it,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.270 align:middle line:84%
than any person
who has ever lived.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's within
the confines of what

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.240 align:middle line:84%
most people consider a
fairly, effete, high brow

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.335 align:middle line:90%
literary project.

00:23:37.335 --> 00:23:38.910 align:middle line:90%
>> "Swann's Way."

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the entirety of
"Remembrance of Things Past."

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:44.167 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I haven't read that.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So you've got me a
bit in the dark here.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:90%
We have about five minutes left.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So could you summarize that
point or amplify it a bit?

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the point
we're trying to make here,

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that I have been involved
with over the past few years,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:84%
is that a revisioning of time
would assuage much of what is

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:12.990 align:middle line:84%
called modern anxiety, and that
we have limited the categories

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.890 align:middle line:84%
we were willing to entertain
in dealing with this problem,

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:21.180 align:middle line:84%
and that we must genuflect to
the ancient Chinese and take

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.570 align:middle line:84%
a page from their
notebook in this matter.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:30.240 align:middle line:84%
The I Ching as a divinatory
system of great age reflecting

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
the dynamics of our own
genetic material and also,

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.260 align:middle line:84%
though I didn't mention
this this evening,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
it also has deep
calendrical properties--

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
it can be used to
keep track of time--

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:84%
lay as a basis for
an understanding

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of this curious phenomenon
called synchronicity,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the coincidental meshing
of interior psychic events

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and exterior events
in the real world.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It lays the basis
for us to understand

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
the unity of ourselves
with the real world

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that our present approach
makes it difficult to discern.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So whereas Carl Jung the
great Swiss psychiatrist,

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
who wrote incidentally
the preface to Richard

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Wilhelm's book of the I Ching,
and postulated this theory

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
of synchronicity, well, Jung
didn't really provide any

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:90%
mechanism for synchronicity.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
He simply said it works this
way, that the mind seems

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:90%
to be related to these events.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And he found an enormous
therapeutic benefit

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:90%
from that understanding.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
What you're suggesting is
that the potential mechanism

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
behind the Jungian
notion of synchronicity

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.160 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the
structure of time itself.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And you must be
suggesting, therefore,

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that the human mind at this
very deep level that the sages

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.490 align:middle line:84%
discovered from
stilling their organism,

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.440 align:middle line:84%
that the mind has a
parallel structure,

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:90%
an isomorphic structure.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> That's exactly
the central point.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.370 align:middle line:90%
The mind arises out of matter.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
This is why the I Ching
works in both worlds.

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:84%
One is the reflection
of the other.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The key to healing
the apparent dualism

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:84%
lies in studying the
temporal mechanics indicated

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%
by the I Ching.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we've done this
formally, mathematically.

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Terence McKenna, you're
taking the provocative position

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
that the I Ching, which some
people view as religion,

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and other people
dismisses superstition,

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
is actually a science.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And I gather that your computer
software package Timewave Zero

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
proposes to be the
demonstration of that?

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:39.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We believe it
does demonstrate it.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Of course, ultimately, it
will be up to our colleagues

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:90%
to judge the worth of our case.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Terence, it's
been a pleasure.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.568 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for being with me.

00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it's been a pleasure
to be here, Jeffrey,

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.060 align:middle line:90%
and discuss this with you.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:57.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not an easy
subject, believe me.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very
much for being with us.
