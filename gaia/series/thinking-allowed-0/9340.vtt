I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
psychic and spiritual healing

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific perspective.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
My guest, Dr.
Elizabeth Targ, is one

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of America's
foremost researchers

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
in the area of psychic
and spiritual healing.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.740 align:middle line:84%
She is the Director
of the Institute--

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:84%

Medical Research--

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:84%

Research Institute-- there it

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
is-- at the California
Pacific Medical Center.

She is a member of the faculty
of the University of California

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.350 align:middle line:84%
San Francisco School of Medicine
Department of psychiatry.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Elizabeth.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You are an unusual
person for a psychiatrist

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
and a medical doctor
to be exploring

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
so deeply the psychic and
spiritual side of medicine.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
But in your case, your
interest in parapsychology

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:90%
began when you were quite young.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:84%
I was introduced to the concept
really by my father, Russ Targ,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
who's a physicist who's
been doing research

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.423 align:middle line:84%
in parapsychology and remote
viewing for many, many years.

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've had the pleasure
of interviewing them on this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.370 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
>> In fact.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.910 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the people
who really introduced

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
the concept of remote
viewing to the public

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and to the research community,
even to the government.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what he introduced
for me was the concept that one

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.650 align:middle line:84%
can do research in an area
like this, that you can do--

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.570 align:middle line:84%
you can ask questions
about things

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.357 align:middle line:84%
that are not understood
at all and still get

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
meaningful data out of it.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
So your approach
really is to look

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:84%
at the impact of a spiritual
lifestyle, spiritual practices,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
spiritual disciplines
and techniques

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective
of a researcher.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, that's right.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Most of what I'm doing is
within a medical context.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:84%
The Complementary Medicine
Research Institute

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.150 align:middle line:84%
is the research branch
of a whole complementary

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.830 align:middle line:90%
alternative--

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:84%
what you might call a
mind-body-spirit medicine

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.665 align:middle line:84%
clinical program at the
California Pacific Medical

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Center, it's called
the Institute

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.360 align:middle line:90%
for Health and Healing.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And we were really set up
because all kinds of people,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
as you might imagine, in
the San Francisco Bay Area

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
are exploring new
mind-body-spirit approaches,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and there's been almost
no information at all

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:84%
to tell us whether
these things are useful,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.220 align:middle line:84%
for whom they might
be useful, and which

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
approaches might be the best.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:90%
And so that's why we exist.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So what that means, though,
is that our context is really

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
always specifically about
healing and/or personal growth.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I understand
your work correctly,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.350 align:middle line:84%
I would say there
are two components.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:84%
One would be healing is done by
people who are gifted healers,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and the other
would be people who

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.400 align:middle line:84%
are ill who themselves get
involved in groups, support

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.540 align:middle line:84%
groups of a spiritual nature
and visualization, meditation

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
practices of that
sort for self-healing.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:84%
My work at the
research institute

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
actually began probably
six or seven years ago

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
when the then director
of the Cancer Research

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Institute, Helene Smith,
came to me and said,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
what I see is that thousands of
women around the state who have

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
developed breast cancer are
starting to explore prayer

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.167 align:middle line:84%
and meditation and yoga, and
they are coming back and saying

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that they've had
spiritual epiphanies,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.875 align:middle line:84%
they're writing books about
it, and they're saying,

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
and then I went into
remission, and this is

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.760 align:middle line:90%
why my breast cancer is cured.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And the question
she had and posed to

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.090 align:middle line:84%
me is, how many of those same
women did all those things

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and had no spiritual epiphany
or had a spiritual epiphany

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and did not do well
with their illness?

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And she-- and I really felt we
needed to study this question

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and find out whether this was
going to make a difference.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example
of the kind of program

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
that we study where
individuals are

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
participating in a
personal exploration

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:90%
or personal practice.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's a
great step forward.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It used to be the case,
I think, that people

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
were afraid to discuss these
things with their doctors.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.595 align:middle line:90%
>> That's definitely true.

00:05:05.595 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
The other way you
might put it is

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that their doctors were
afraid to discuss these things

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:90%
with the patients, too.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
That is, there have
been studies now

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:90%
looking at this that say some--

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you can poll people and you find
somewhere between 75% and 80%

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
of people in this
country say that they

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
would like to be speaking
with their physicians

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.840 align:middle line:90%
about spiritual issues.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.000 align:middle line:84%
If you poll physicians, you
find that only 10% of physicians

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:90%
have ever done that even once.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
When we first started
our study, for example,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
with the women
with breast cancer,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.080 align:middle line:84%
the biggest concern
at the medical center

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
actually came from
the nurses, who

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:84%
felt that we would be
intruding on the patients

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.730 align:middle line:84%
or disturbing them or
upsetting them if we asked them

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.580 align:middle line:84%
about their spiritual experience
or personal spiritual beliefs

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
or practice.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.333 align:middle line:84%
So our first study was what
you call feasibility trial.

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Were we going to scare
people away and were we

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:84%
going to hurt them by opening
this question in a small group

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:90%
discussion?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess there has been
over the decades a separation

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.910 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual and the medical
approaches to the point where

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the professional organizations
of medicine often would label

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
spiritual approaches as
nothing more than quackery.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Or what-- it's actually--
you're absolutely right,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.400 align:middle line:84%
and it's in some ways even
more insidious and built

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:90%
into the profession.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'll actually
tell you that one

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
of the reasons I do this work
is because I'm a psychiatrist,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and I think as a psychiatrist,
I feel a special responsibility

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
around this problem
that has evolved.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
the problem is is

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.518 align:middle line:84%
that nobody wants to be
told that they're crazy,

00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
nobody wants anybody to
think that they're crazy,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and yet these the
medical designation,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.500 align:middle line:84%
the medical-- formal medical
diagnosis for anybody who

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
believes in what they list
in the medical textbooks

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:84%
as sixth sense, extrasensory
perception, telepathy,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
or people who have the
experience that there

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
is meaning in everything
that they see around them,

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that that's listed only as
a form of psychopathology,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
as schizophrenia or psychosis.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it is
changing, I presume.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.900 align:middle line:84%
It's changing, but I think it's
changing only slowly, quite

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:84%
frankly, that these
are still listed right

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
now in the current diagnostic
and statistical manuals

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
that are used by every
psychiatrist and psychologist

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:90%
in the country.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
And what that doesn't do
is give room for people

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to have these experiences
and not necessarily be crazy.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The other thing it
does is it makes

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
it very difficult for
scientists or for physicians

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:84%
to talk openly about even
considering the possibility

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.257 align:middle line:84%
that there might be some
real external validity

00:08:08.257 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:90%
to these kinds of reports.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm sure you
know that there is.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:84%
You, as I recall,
did experiments--

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
telepathy experiments between
Russia and the United States

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:84%
many years ago when
you were much younger.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> And got excellent data.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Published your results,
you've published

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
a number of telepathy studies.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And right now there's no
place for that in science.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I had a kind of
a remarkable experience

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
a couple of years ago.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
There was a conference that was
set up at the Harvard Medical

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.470 align:middle line:84%
School jointly between
Harvard and the Institute

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.380 align:middle line:84%
of Noetic Sciences, which is a
group that does a lot of work

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness research.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And they invited I think some
60 or 70 medical researchers,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
university researchers from
around the country who are all

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
doing foremost trials,
studies of distant healing

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
or distant healing
intentionality.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And they flew us
all out to Harvard

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and we all sat around
in the usual way

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.340 align:middle line:84%
presenting data and
discussing research protocols.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.610 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that was
unusual about this meeting

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
is that the guest
list was confidential.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:84%
That is, the researchers were
only comfortable in attending

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.510 align:middle line:84%
this meeting if they could be
guaranteed that nobody would

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.600 align:middle line:84%
know that they were
interested in pursuing

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.010 align:middle line:90%
this type of research.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:35.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It has a social stigma
attached to it within

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream
academic community.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.932 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be--
actually, what's

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:84%
really interesting to me is
it seems to be a perceived

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:90%
social stigma.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
That is, everybody seems to
be very worried about it.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I and
many other researchers

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
now have done formal
trials on this,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we have successfully published
them in the mainstream,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and when we actually go
and present our data,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:90%
nobody has a problem with it.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:84%
People will discuss
with us, I think

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:84%
as is appropriate very formally,
the protocols and the data

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
and ask appropriate questions.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well then you, to my
way of thinking, Elizabeth,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:90%
are a seminal person.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
You're right at the
turning point from one era

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.270 align:middle line:84%
to another, an
era where this was

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%
a taboo topic to an era in which
it's an acceptable, respectable

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.050 align:middle line:90%
scientific topic.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.870 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the people
who helped turn the corner.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well things are really
changing right now.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I think probably the
most dramatic change that

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
has happened,
actually, is that now

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
the National Institutes
of Health, which

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
is the prime funder for
university research,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
actually has a formal category
to which you can apply

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
if you're interested in doing a
study, of what some would call

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:90%
prayer or psychic healing.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
What they call it at the NIH
is distant mental influence

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:90%
on biological systems.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> But we know what that means.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And there have been how many
published studies in that field

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:90%
now?

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been probably
close to 150 published studies.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It's only recently that
those studies are showing up

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
in mainstream journals.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The most exciting
development in that area

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.660 align:middle line:84%
was a study that was published
just this last October--

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Elizabeth?

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.232 align:middle line:90%
>> We're going to take a break.

00:11:19.232 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Today I'm speaking with
Dr. Elizabeth Targ.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about research in
psychic and spiritual healing.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Targ is the Director of the
Complementary Medicine Research

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Institute at the California
Pacific Medical Center

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
You were just mentioning
before our break, Elizabeth,

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.470 align:middle line:84%
that there are 150
published studies

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
on the effects of distant
mental influence as a healing

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.670 align:middle line:90%
technique.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:84%
150 studies, and it's still
considered a fringe area.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure that for other areas
that are very well-accepted,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
like the role of aspirin in
preventing heart attacks,

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:90%
far fewer studies were required.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That's actually the case,
and far fewer studies often are

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.125 align:middle line:84%
done in those areas that are
really formerly controlled.

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
That's actually something
that's been written

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
about in the
scientific media, is

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the fact that
parapsychology actually

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
tends to have the best
controlled studies, which

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.182 align:middle line:90%
is appropriate, actually.

00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The best controlled
studies and more of them.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's necessary
because these studies--

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:84%
this data, the idea that
the mind can exert a healing

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.670 align:middle line:84%
influence at a
distance, not mediated

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.920 align:middle line:84%
by any known physical
mechanism, challenges

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.490 align:middle line:84%
the materialistic
paradigm of science.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It certainly does.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.498 align:middle line:84%
Now what I want to mention also
is how things are changing now

00:12:57.498 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:90%
with these breakthroughs.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.630 align:middle line:84%
There was just a study
just recently published

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.930 align:middle line:84%
in the "Archives of
Internal Medicine," which

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:84%
has got to be one of the most
conservative and most carefully

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
reviewed medical journals in the
country, and they published a--

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.790 align:middle line:84%
what is actually
replication of another study

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.180 align:middle line:84%
of 1,000 patients
with heart disease

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
who had gone through heart
surgery who were randomly

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:90%
divided into two groups.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
One group was prayed for,
the other one wasn't.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
They didn't even know
they were in a study,

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and they still found a
significant difference.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
>> None of them knew
they were in a study.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> They didn't even know--

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> There could not have been
a placebo effect at all.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
>> No chance of a-- there's
a whole other concern about

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.680 align:middle line:84%
whether that's not an
appropriate thing to do.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.882 align:middle line:84%
Personally I think that
people have a right

00:13:41.882 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to know whether
they're in a study.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.625 align:middle line:84%
>> But that would be, I guess,
a triple-blind condition.

00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.840 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be a
triple-blind condition.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Normally just double-blind
is considered a requirement

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:90%
for research of this sort.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you were saying how
carefully controlled these

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.800 align:middle line:84%
trials have to be, and one of
the reasons they have to be

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.368 align:middle line:84%
carefully controlled
is because--

00:14:03.368 --> 00:14:04.910 align:middle line:84%
you can look sort
of from the outside

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.618 align:middle line:84%
and say, well because
it's controversial.

00:14:06.618 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But the reason
it's controversial

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
is a good reason, because there
are many, many ways that people

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:90%
can fool themselves.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> That is, when I first
started hearing about the idea

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.610 align:middle line:84%
of psychic healing
or prayer healing,

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.190 align:middle line:90%
I was really very skeptical.

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think it
was going to work.

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And the reason was
that as a psychiatrist,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
I like to think that if somebody
who is ill or distressed

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.725 align:middle line:84%
sits with a
well-intentioned person

00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and whom they have some
confidence, that even that will

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
generate a certain
amount of hope

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and improved mood and
expectation for improvement.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I look
around and I listen

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to people's anecdotal claims
about healing, what they're

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.650 align:middle line:84%
usually telling me is about
how some very special person,

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
usually very loving
and very confident

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
person came and
spent time with them

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and told them that they
were going to get better

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and created an unusual
environment with candles

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:84%
or incense, and then they
start to feel better.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Bedside manner.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Bedside manner.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's wonderful
that bedside manner can

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
be so helpful, but that's
different than suggesting

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
that there might be
some mental or what

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.630 align:middle line:84%
some people are calling an
energetic effect at a distance.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
separate question.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I know, even
parapsychologists were very

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:84%
skeptical about psychic healing
up until the 1960s when I

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
believe it was Bernard
Grad at McGill University,

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:84%
a biologist there, first did
studies having a well-known

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:90%
healer treat mice.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things about
doing studies in healing,

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:51.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the difficulties
is that if what you want--

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.360 align:middle line:84%
if the question that
you're really interested in

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.047 align:middle line:84%
is there what people call a
distant or non-local effect,

00:15:57.047 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you want to know,
then what you're going to end

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
up studying is something
different than the way

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.690 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual healer
would normally work.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that already
creates a difficulty.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It means that you're not doing
a completely naturalistic study.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Well some healers do
work at a distance, though.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Some do work at a distance,
but most of the time, still,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
their patient knows that
they're working for them,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.782 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of times
they might say,

00:16:22.782 --> 00:16:25.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be working for
you at 4 o'clock this afternoon

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like you to lie
quietly and be open.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.445 align:middle line:84%
And so even that could
make a difference.

00:16:30.445 --> 00:16:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there's a lot of
evidence for that just from

00:16:33.698 --> 00:16:35.350 align:middle line:90%
meditation research.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So to really ask this
question, if you eliminate--

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
if you eliminate the
expectation, if you eliminate

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.660 align:middle line:84%
the preparation, if you
eliminate the contact,

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
if you eliminate the warm
hands, take it all away,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.280 align:middle line:90%
there's still an effect.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to go to some pretty
extreme lengths sometimes

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:90%
to set that up.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well that's precisely what
you did in research funded

00:16:58.750 --> 00:16:59.680 align:middle line:90%
by the government.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Actually, our new study is
funded by the government.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
our third study.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:05.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Third formal trial of distant
healing for people with HIV.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
And with each one we've tried
to expand it and refine it.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
In the first two
studies, what we

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
did was work with people
as healers who were known

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.630 align:middle line:84%
or at least who claimed
and were thought

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
to be extraordinary healers
of one type or another.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
We chose healers from
all over the country

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.240 align:middle line:84%
of all different
types, because we

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
didn't know which
healer was going

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to be the best because
we didn't even know

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
if healing was going to work.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So we just took a
broad range and said,

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.270 align:middle line:84%
well, people come to us if
you think you can do this.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we set them up to be
given photographs of people

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.610 align:middle line:84%
with AIDS and to
spend an hour a day

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.810 align:middle line:90%
sending their healing intention.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we followed patients who
had had this experience, then,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:84%
for six months, and we found
significant differences

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:90%
between the groups.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing in this study
is we're asking the question,

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.040 align:middle line:90%
who is a healer?

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The first study we had
special famous people

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.030 align:middle line:90%
who claim to be healers.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
In the new study, we're working
still with experienced healers,

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:84%
but also including mainstream
nurses who may never

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.710 align:middle line:84%
have had any experience
or practice in doing

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.620 align:middle line:84%
this kind of healing,
but yet who are obviously

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.200 align:middle line:84%
in a profession that's all
about compassionate intention

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it follows
the work that you've

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.825 align:middle line:84%
done in remote
viewing, it suggests

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that these skills,
although they're not

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
widely acknowledged, are
still widely distributed

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:90%
in the population.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.030 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my guess.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, that's
what we call a hypothesis.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.062 align:middle line:84%
There are other
people who disagree,

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and they may be right, too,
because there's some people who

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:90%
say that there may be--

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.013 align:middle line:84%
that certain people are better
natural healers, some people--

00:19:01.013 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:84%
there's certain
traditional groups

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:08.053 align:middle line:84%
that say that it's a
hereditary ability,

00:19:08.053 --> 00:19:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and there's certainly many
schools around the country that

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:84%
are teaching healing, which
would suggest that somebody

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
ought to go from being not so
good to be better if they took

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:90%
the course.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.595 align:middle line:90%
So this is the first step.

00:19:20.595 --> 00:19:22.350 align:middle line:84%
A study we'd like
to do in the future,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
actually, would be to take
novices, people who've never

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
tried to do healing, look
at their healing ability

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.355 align:middle line:84%
if they have any, and then put
them through a training course

00:19:33.355 --> 00:19:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and see if it
makes a difference.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you said there was
a difference in your study

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.910 align:middle line:84%
between the patients who
received the distant mental

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
influence, the positive healing
intentions of another person.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Could you describe
that difference?

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:90%
How noticeable was it?

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference in the
study was actually very,

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.940 align:middle line:90%
very strong and very dramatic.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.290 align:middle line:84%
We looked-- actually, what I'd
like to do is actually tell you

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
what all of the results were
because one of the concerns

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.510 align:middle line:84%
people often have
about healing studies

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
is maybe only the significant
results were reported,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to tell you
everything we looked at.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.280 align:middle line:84%
What we looked at was the
number of AIDS-defining diseases

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
that the patient developed
over the study period.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the severity
of those illnesses,

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.010 align:middle line:84%
we looked at the number
of doctor visits,

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:30.710 align:middle line:84%
the number of hospital visits,
the length of hospitalizations,

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:36.200 align:middle line:84%
psychological changes,
functional changes, CD4 count,

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:90%
and survival.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we found is that people
who were in the healing group,

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
even though they didn't
know they were receiving

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
the healing-- and we
the researchers also

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
didn't know that they were
receiving the healing,

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.640 align:middle line:84%
they had-- the
people who received

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
the healing had six
times fewer new illnesses

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:90%
than the people who did not.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:59.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Six times?

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.240 align:middle line:84%
That's in a population
of 40 patients.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition, the illnesses
that they developed were

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
significantly less
severe, because with AIDS,

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.040 align:middle line:84%
obviously there's a range of
severity we were only looking

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
at the most severe illnesses
in this categorization.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And still, among the
most severe illnesses,

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.668 align:middle line:84%
the people who didn't
get the treatment

00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who got
the severe illnesses.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds as if-- what you're
telling me is that the psychic

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.190 align:middle line:84%
healing effect was as strong
as any known chemical or drug

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.270 align:middle line:90%
treatment for AIDS.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know that
I could say that,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to look at
the data to compare.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.450 align:middle line:84%
I think we really don't
know under which conditions

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.310 align:middle line:90%
it's going to help somebody.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The new treatments
for AIDS, what

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:55.450 align:middle line:84%
they call the heart therapies,
the antiretroviral medications

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and protease inhibitors
have completely

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.410 align:middle line:90%
changed the face of AIDS.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I think,
actually, it brings up

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
a really important point,
that people-- some people have

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:84%
been concerned
about our research,

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we would be
encouraging people not to take

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:90%
their conventional medicine.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.600 align:middle line:84%
What we do in our
studies is we call it

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:90%
an adjunctive treatment.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So what we have recommended
to all of our patients

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:84%
is that they continue taking
their regular treatments

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and then we see
what this might add.

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We obviously have a
lot to learn about it.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And as the drugs
are always changing,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and the research
on psychic healing

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:84%
is becoming more
sophisticated, it

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
will be interesting to see
how they can work together.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dr. Elizabeth Targ, this
has been a very enlightening

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%
experience, I'm so thrilled
that you're doing this work

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and finding support from
the medical establishment

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:90%
and from the government.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth, thanks so
much for being with me.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and check your program listing
for part 2 of this two-part

Targ on psychic and spiritual

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:90%
healing.
