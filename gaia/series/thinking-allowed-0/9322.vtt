>>JEFFREY MISHLOVE:
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're going
to explore goddesses

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
in older women.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr.
Jean Shinoda Bolen--

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.300 align:middle line:84%
a Jungian analyst and clinical
professor at the University

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:84%
of California San
Francisco Medical Center.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Bolen is the author
of numerous books,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.080 align:middle line:84%
including "Close To The Bone,"
"The Dow of Psychology,"

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:84%
"Goddesses in everywoman",
"Gods in everyman,"

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:90%
and "Goddesses in Older Women--

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Becoming a Juicy Crome."

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jean.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN SHINODA BOLEN:
Good to be with you again.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: It's a
pleasure to be with you.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:84%
The whole question of
the archetypal energies

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
that infused people
as they age I think

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
is coming more to the forefront
now because of the baby boomer

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
generation and the aging
of that generation.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: It's especially
coming to the fore

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
because we are the
generation of women

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
that have been
defining ourselves

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
every decade since the
women's movement began.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So as this generation gets
older, there's a redefinition.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
There is a noticing that at
50, we don't feel very old.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
And there's this energy
that we now have.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
And we look ahead and see women
who are 60, 70, 80, even 90,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:90%
who still have vitality.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.225 align:middle line:84%
And my inquiry is to what is
it that makes a woman juicy?

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And from the
perspective of a Jungian

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
psychotherapist,
you draw on the idea

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.740 align:middle line:84%
of the power of an
archetypal energy

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.670 align:middle line:84%
and that these archetypal
energies are classically

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.595 align:middle line:84%
associated with the gods
and goddesses of mythology.

00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, the
energies are present.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.450 align:middle line:84%
There are potentials
in everybody.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And when women have
not been allowed

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
to be figures of
wisdom or figures

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.470 align:middle line:84%
of action or
compassion, they recede

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:90%
into the collective unconscious.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:84%
But then as these energies
start to rise in women,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%
the patterns begin to reemerge.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And they do connect
with energies

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that go back to ancient
myths and ancient goddesses

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.710 align:middle line:84%
and current goddesses
for that matter.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And if you look at
the study today of mythology

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.377 align:middle line:84%
and folklore and
archeology, we're seeing,

00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, literally
of what you could

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.860 align:middle line:84%
call the rise of the goddess,
the remembering of the fact

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
that there were goddess cultures
that were very vibrant at one

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
time on this planet and for
much of the last 2,000 year

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
period of the
monotheistic dominance.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.227 align:middle line:84%
These goddess cultures
have been suppressed.

00:03:22.227 --> 00:03:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And it's
fascinating that it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
coincided with the
women's movement

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
that there was a remembering
or finding the Gnostic Gospels.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
The early Christian
had a sense of Sophia

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.530 align:middle line:84%
as a feminine
aspect of divinity.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
There's Marija
Gimbutas digging up

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.040 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things that
show us the way to an earlier

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.980 align:middle line:90%
pre-patriarchal culture.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And but from an
archetypal energy

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or psychological potentiality,
which interests me most of all,

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.150 align:middle line:90%
they serve as--

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Jung said that unlived out
archetypes in the culture still

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And when energy flows, it's
like finding old water beds that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
go underground rivers that just
channeled through the pattern.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
naming, is the patterns

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
that are emerging in
a generation of women

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
who are older,
meaning postmenopausal

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.080 align:middle line:84%
in the third phase as
in maiden mother crown,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.560 align:middle line:84%
or in our individual
act threes, that

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
what do we do with act
three of our lives?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.150 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
energies might there

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.540 align:middle line:84%
be potentially in
all older women, who,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.790 align:middle line:84%
if they tap into it,
they've got new vitality.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, in
your classic book,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
which is I think a best seller
now, "Goddesses in everywoman,"

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
you refer to the
olympian goddesses, who

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%
are rather well-known.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We have Hera and
Athena and Aphrodite.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.092 align:middle line:84%
But in this book, while you
touch on those goddesses,

00:04:57.092 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:84%
you're also looking at some
of the goddesses who have

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:90%
been hidden more in mythology.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Absolutely,
because the Greek gods

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and patriarchal
mythology favors women

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
as maidens or as mature
women who are embodied

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and can be made into statuary.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And the patriarchy has
never been very interested

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:90%
in women in their elder years.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, women are supposed
to become invisible and fade

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.640 align:middle line:90%
into the woodwork.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And if for some 300 or 400
years to be an outspoken woman

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:84%
brought you to the
inquisition into the stake,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
it was a survival tactic
to become invisible.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Some of the words
we use for elderly women,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.240 align:middle line:84%
like hag or crone,
in our culture

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
have a negative connotation.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But you're working
to revive more the...

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
a deeper understanding
of these words.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, that was
one of the challenges.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
There aren't any good
words for older women.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:84%
That tells you something about
the projections and prejudices

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:84%
against becoming an
older woman if you

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.530 align:middle line:84%
can't find a decent
word that isn't

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:90%
colored in a negative way.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Crone is colored
in a negative way

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
because it's usually put
together with dried up

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:84%
and old, right,
or what have you.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So when I start to
look at this age group

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and see that this is
far from the case,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.098 align:middle line:84%
and to then refer to a
green and juicy crone,

00:06:37.098 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole different image.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And that juicy and crone
together redeem the word crone.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Now hag is a perfectly
dreadful word, really.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it conotates
all kinds of images.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it came
from the word meaning

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.970 align:middle line:90%
holy one, or saintly one.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
In hagiography,
the study of saints

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.230 align:middle line:90%
comes from that same root word.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But it, like women, and older
women, negativized, demonized,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.505 align:middle line:90%
trivialized, et cetera.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.210 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a very negative word.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
That one is beyond
redemption at this point.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, you refer,
I think, to the great church

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.225 align:middle line:84%
in Constantinople,
the Hagia Sophia.

00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.470 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: It was
really the Christian,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
the Eastern Christian
continued to have an affinity

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
toward the great mother.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was great wisdom, the
great wise mother Hagia Sophia.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And when the Western
Christian looked at that name,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
the association was
with a very minor saint

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:84%
as if there would be this
magnificent structure,

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:90%
dedicated to a minor saint.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
That was an image of
the continued connection

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
with a great mother.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.700 align:middle line:84%
That's true of many the great
cathedrals in Europe as well.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.633 align:middle line:90%
Chartres cathedral is--

00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Notre Dame.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Yes, right.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, I feel
strongly about this myself.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that when I
think of the esoteric wisdom,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:84%
traditions as best
I can see, they're

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:84%
all based on the recovery of
the wisdom of the goddess,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.150 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine wisdom that
has been lost in our age.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And so the study
of these goddesses

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
is the study of all
sorts of hidden powers

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
that for me, as a man, I can
say that they are the birthright

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:90%
of all humans, not just women.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:44.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited to see powerful,
juicy crones in our era.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just as excited
for myself as for them.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, archetypes
are present in all of us.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The male and female archetypes
are present in all of us.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think that a
woman in her third phase

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.840 align:middle line:84%
is more likely to be in touch
with certain ones because

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:90%
of her experience.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And what I did in describing
these goddesses was really

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.150 align:middle line:84%
describe them as
ways to understand

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.450 align:middle line:90%
the energies that arise.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:15.530 align:middle line:84%
So not everybody gets
wiser as they get older.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But the potential to get
wiser as you get older,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.560 align:middle line:84%
if you integrate the
experiences that you have,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and if you have certain talents
towards certain qualities

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.270 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom, they mature.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
They ripen.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.258 align:middle line:84%
They become truly
juicy qualities

00:09:29.258 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
when you're in the third phase.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
So I took four obscure names
to personify those wisdom

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.590 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.770 align:middle line:84%
There was Metis, who
was a pre olympian

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
goddess of wisdom,
who represents

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
a intellectual and
practical wisdom.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
She was the first
wife of Zeus, gave him

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.490 align:middle line:84%
the advice as to how he
could win Olympus and become

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.300 align:middle line:90%
chief god.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And he tricked her into becoming
small and swallowed her.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Because if we look
at the mythological history,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
we see that the
olympian gods actually

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.600 align:middle line:84%
vanquished an earlier group
of gods known as the Titans.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: And before that,
there was the feminine there,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
began with Gaia, et cetera.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So there is this acknowledgment
in the mythology,

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
the traces of what came
before that fascinate me.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a
feminine wisdom,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
isn't it interesting that
in the very mythology,

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.040 align:middle line:84%
the example was that she was
tricked into becoming small

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
and swallowed by Zeus.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And then Zeus said that
he could counsel her.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:84%
He could get her
counsel from his belly.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's the kind
of wisdom that has

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to do with, for example, if for
millennia, a woman could not

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
bring forth an idea or write
something or paint something

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and put her name on it, then
obviously, if she contributed

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to that theory idea
of painting, it

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.430 align:middle line:90%
had her husband's name on it.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.100 align:middle line:90%
There was a swallowing up.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And even today, a
potential for women's

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to be tricked into
becoming small, meaning

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that she doesn't have
very much self-esteem,

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
she can put out an idea.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And someone else
can run with it.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.190 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Very powerful.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Jean, powerful in
the sense that it

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:90%
affects so many people today.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It speaks of a very real story.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.485 align:middle line:84%
We're about to
take a short break.

00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:25.285 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
goddesses and older women

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%
with Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And Jean, before our
break, you brought up

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
this very powerful example
of the goddess Metis,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:90%
who was swallowed up by Zeus.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And in your book,
you contrast her

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.410 align:middle line:84%
with the goddess Athena, who is
like Zeus's favorite daughter

00:11:53.410 --> 00:12:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and often doesn't recognize the
power of the Metis archetype.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well,
that's a very-- now,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.460 align:middle line:84%
in contrast, the birth
of Athena is very famous.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
She was supposedly born full
grown out of Zeus's head

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and had no awareness
that she even

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
had a mother because her
mother was swallowed by Father.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And daughters of the
patriarchy, fathers, daughters,

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
often don't acknowledge or
see the value of the feminine

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.653 align:middle line:84%
at all until somewhere along the
line often when they are older,

00:12:28.653 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:84%
they begin to
realize that there's

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
a sub strata of wisdom that
is different from the energy

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
that they have been engaged
in the competitive achievement

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:90%
oriented energies.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:84%
And if they start to
acquire a wisdom that

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
says they've got these skills,
they've got this education,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
they've got this
intellect, and they've

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
added another dimension, often
that brings in the compassion

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:84%
from the goddess, the
goddesses of compassion.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom and compassion are
true gifts of the third phase,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
that you're not a
juicy human being,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
much less a juicy
crone unless you

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
have those qualities of
wisdom and compassion.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
Now in talking about
these goddesses,

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.965 align:middle line:84%
I'm referring to them
as archetypal energies.

00:13:15.965 --> 00:13:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So each of them represents
a certain different kind

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom for example.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a Sophia as
a wisdom that you--

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the mystical wisdom,
the ones that you--

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
like in gnosticism, where
the word begins with the word

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.700 align:middle line:90%
G-N-O. I like that.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a wisdom that
you gno as well as

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom that is the more
logical kinds of knowledge

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that you have.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And the mystic knows things
directly, knows something

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of the
sacred, knows something

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
about the connection
with the divinity that

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
may be experienced in
many different situations.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Rather than taking
the words of somebody

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
about what they should
believe, the mystical woman

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:90%
has a direct experience.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.770 align:middle line:90%
And that is a real wisdom.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the wisdom that has

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to do with Hecate or Hek-ate,
the goddess of the crossroad.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.700 align:middle line:84%
She is a true intuitive
one who knows because she

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:90%
has gone through her dissents.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
She knows she's recovered
from life's difficulties.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.585 align:middle line:90%
She's learned from experience.

00:14:19.585 --> 00:14:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Now, this
is a goddess often

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
associated with witchcraft.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: She's been demonized
because she certainly

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.340 align:middle line:84%
is the archetype
of the midwife who

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.160 align:middle line:84%
knows about the transitions
in labor and delivery.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And she's also
that part of women

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
who are very comfortable being
with people who are dying

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:90%
or sick.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They're not afraid of that
particular liminal phase

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:90%
from this world to the next.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the archetype
of the therapist who

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
helps people when they
get to a crossroad

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:90%
to the fork in the road.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
That's where she
lived so to speak.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.910 align:middle line:84%
She was the goddess of
the fork in the road.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.850 align:middle line:84%
When you had a major
transition or a choice to make,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:84%
you'd come to that fork in
the road metaphorically.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's Hecate's wisdom
that can guide you

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.790 align:middle line:90%
as to which path to take.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Now another goddess
who has been demonized clearly

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
is Kali from the
Hindu tradition.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Yes, Kali and Sekhmet,
the lion headed goddess,

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:84%
I put in the class of goddesses
of transformative wrath,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
or the archetype of
enough is enough.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is something
that often women as they

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.700 align:middle line:84%
enter perimenopause
and menopause,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
they start to really take
a good look at their lives

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:90%
up to this point.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it is really a crossroad
time, a now or never

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.520 align:middle line:84%
to get out of a dysfunctional
relationship or to change it.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the kind of
energies that women have

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:84%
as they see what's
happening in the culture.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And third phase of
life women have a sense

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.152 align:middle line:90%
of wanting to give back.

00:15:57.152 --> 00:15:59.360 align:middle line:84%
They know that their lives
are very different because

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:90%
of the women's movement.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
They now have
energy, time perhaps.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And giving back
might be then to say

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.930 align:middle line:84%
enough is enough to some kind
of environmental or social

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:90%
injustice.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:14.272 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Like the
woman who founded

00:16:14.272 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Mothers against
Drunk Driving would

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.542 align:middle line:84%
be an example of the
embodiment of this archetype.

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Right, of
enough is enough.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Or the Million Moms March
that began this millennia

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
in Washington with all the women
marching and saying-- in fact,

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.750 align:middle line:84%
they were saying,
too, that deaths

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that were brought on by
the lack of gun control

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.680 align:middle line:90%
enough is enough.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well, when
I interviewed you

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:84%
some years ago about
"Goddesses in everywoman,"

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I recall you said women have
to be careful about being

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:90%
possessed by a goddess energy.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not always a healthy thing.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.880 align:middle line:84%
But my sense in reading
"Goddesses in older woman"

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.710 align:middle line:84%
was a much more
favorable accounting

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of these archetypal
energies and the role

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.641 align:middle line:84%
that they can play in
the lives of older women.

00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Because
there's a potential

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're
balanced by the time

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.557 align:middle line:90%
you are in your third phase.

00:17:06.557 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
But for example, if you
were to be carried away

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
by Sekhmet and Kali, then
it is that sense of you

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
are just so enraged, that
your anger is out of control,

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and the you that is
this reasonable person

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
has been totally taken over
by this rathful energy.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And women are sometimes
afraid of their anger

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
because they suppressed
it for so long

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that there's a fear that
they're going to go crazy

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.180 align:middle line:84%
if they get angry, rather
than that this is just

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
a quality of
important energy that

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.880 align:middle line:84%
is arising at a crossroad
time, that it is

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.515 align:middle line:90%
time to say enough is enough.

00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: There's a
part of the myth of Kali

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.080 align:middle line:84%
as I recall where she is out
slaying all the evil ones.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
But she gets so caught up
in the blood lust of slaying

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.098 align:middle line:84%
that she forgets herself
and needs to be healed.

00:17:58.098 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: One of the
interesting things

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
is that the reason she's
on that battlefield at all

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
is that there were three major
demons that the male gods could

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.710 align:middle line:90%
not defeat.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So if the world was
to be safe, then they

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:84%
had to call forth goddess
energy to confront this evil.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.175 align:middle line:90%
And first came Durga.

00:18:16.175 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And then out of
the head of Durga

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
came Kali, this hideous
appearing goddess.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And she could do the job.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.320 align:middle line:84%
But then there was a problem
of being carried away

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
by it until she found herself
stepping on the beautiful body

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
of her husband Shiva.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:90%
And she looked down.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And by looking at
him, looking at her,

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:90%
she came back to her senses.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And often that is true
that if in the middle

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.090 align:middle line:84%
of being caught up by
any kind of emotion,

00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
someone connects with you
and reminds you of yourself.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:90%
Then you come back.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You don't get carried
away like Kali did.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And the
Egyptian goddess Sekhmet

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
is an interesting
one, the lion headed

00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:02.060 align:middle line:84%
goddess, who is both the
goddess of healing and of war.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.830 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Well, she's
the goddess that

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.630 align:middle line:90%
was called force like Sekhmet.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
When there were evil doers
that had to be confronted--

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Like Kali you mean?

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Right.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Yes, she is Sekhmet.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.387 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: Sekhmet-- I'm sorry.

00:19:12.387 --> 00:19:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Sekhmet and Kali are so similar
that I merge them together.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>>JEFFREY: Fierce.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: They're fierce.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.680 align:middle line:84%
The energies of
transformative wrath.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And there is such
a potential when

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.740 align:middle line:84%
a woman is both wise and
strong and can be protective.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
So that if you get into
a Kali Sekhmet phase,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.000 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's
in you to be that,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
then anyone can turn to
you and know that they

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:90%
can be defended by you.

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.680 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of like mother bear.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And you write about
the potential, an older woman,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.730 align:middle line:84%
to have this fierceness,
this fury, these almost

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:84%
demonic goddesses, but
tempered by wisdom.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: And compassion.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting is in our
Greek mythology as our heritage

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.270 align:middle line:84%
in Western civilization,
there isn't a goddess

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:90%
of transformative wrath.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a goddess
with that much power,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
nor is there a
goddess of compassion.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.640 align:middle line:84%
There's Aphrodite, who's
a goddess of erotic love

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:90%
and romance, but not compassion.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the east,
Guan Yin of China,

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:84%
who's also Tara of Tibet
and Kannon of Japan,

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.570 align:middle line:84%
are these powerful, important
goddesses of compassion.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And as you grow older,
that's one of the things that

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.390 align:middle line:90%
grows if you are growing wiser.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:90%
You become compassionate.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Well,
isn't there a sense

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.500 align:middle line:84%
in the Western iconography that
the Virgin Mary, especially

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
in a statue like
the Pieta, seems

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.180 align:middle line:84%
to be the very
embodiment of compassion?

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: People appeal
to her because they

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
know that here is a figure
that has suffered and will

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
understand their pain.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the Catholics
have had an image

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.160 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess of compassion
in the Virgin Mary.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And Americans have had in the
image of the Statue of Liberty,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that I think of as
Lady liberty, a symbol

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
of the compassionate
quality that

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:84%
has drawn all kinds of
almost all immigrants

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
who come to America with a sense
that this is a country that

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
will embrace their hopes, gives
them freedom, opportunity.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And those lines on
the statue itself,

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
give me your tired, your
poor, your teeming masses,

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
yearning to breathe free, that's
a real offer of compassion.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't-- compassion isn't
the same as just feeling sorry

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Compassion and
action go together so

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:84%
that to lend a helping hand or
to be like Tara stepping down

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to enter the world, or older
women who are having compassion

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.580 align:middle line:84%
for abused children,
or starving people,

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
or fearful intimidated
women might then step forth

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.892 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:22:14.892 --> 00:22:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: I mean, there's a
sense that someone like Mother

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.455 align:middle line:84%
Teresa was the embodiment
of this archetype,

00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:22.790 align:middle line:84%
or even princess
Diana before that.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JEAN: Yes, right,
because they were

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:31.060 align:middle line:84%
women who acted on
compassion by taking action.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different
from just saying, well,

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:90%
I feel your pain.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
If you feel the pain
of someone, what

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:84%
do you do to help the pain,
to heal the situation?

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
most important things

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.810 align:middle line:84%
we can do as
individuals in our lives

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:49.240 align:middle line:90%
is to help suffering people.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: Compassion
is probably the highest

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%
of all spiritual gifts.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen, what
a pleasure exploring with you

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.330 align:middle line:84%
these powerful energies
that are greening

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.270 align:middle line:90%
our world and our civilization.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>JEAN: It's a pleasure.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
>>JEFFREY: And thank
you for being with us.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.770 align:middle line:90%
