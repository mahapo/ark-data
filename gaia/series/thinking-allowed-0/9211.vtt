Conversations on the leading

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.530 align:middle line:84%
with psychologist
Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:31.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to look at the
confluence of different value

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.220 align:middle line:84%
systems in our age, the
traditional, the modern,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and the postmodern
values that confront us.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.310 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Professor Huston
Smith, author of many books,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
including "Beyond
the Postmodern Mind,"

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
"Forgotten Truth," "The World's
Religions," and "Why Religion

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.480 align:middle line:90%
Matters."

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Huston.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to be here.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good to be
with you again also.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.260 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if the major
value systems in our culture

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
now could be broken down
into traditional, modern,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and postmodern, and that they
each have unique constraints,

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
unique gifts or emphases that
are important for us today.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:90%
I think that's exactly right.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
To get these three stages that
intellectual historians divide

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.600 align:middle line:84%
our past and present
into, up until the rise

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
of modern science, everybody
lived under the umbrella,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
you might say, of a
traditional world view.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:84%
With the rise of modern science
in the 16th and 17th century,

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.670 align:middle line:84%
a new era was inaugurated, and
we call that the modern period.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.550 align:middle line:84%
And that held sway until roughly
the middle of the 20th century

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:84%
when it came to sort of phase
in to a third period, which

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.720 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a more
accurate name,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
has come to be called
the postmodern.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So those are the three standard
divisions in human history.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And you're quite right in
saying that each one had,

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
with respect to the others,
a particular genius,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
a particular gift for exploring
one area of human experience--

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:90%
all three areas are important.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Having delineated the three
periods chronologically,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.550 align:middle line:84%
let's go to the three important
things about human beings.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The first is, how do we win
our livelihood from the Earth,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
the physical domain in
which our lives are set?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.490 align:middle line:84%
We can call that
the area of nature.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And a second inescapably
important area

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:90%
is human relation.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just talking about
one-on-one like we are here.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about society.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.970 align:middle line:90%
How is it patterned?

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.640 align:middle line:84%
How are the various
groups within it

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to relate the position
in relation of it?

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So now we have nature, and the
other inescapably important

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:90%
point is society.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a third
that's a little more abstract,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:84%
but I think we can
see the importance.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.100 align:middle line:84%
How do we relate ourselves
to the whole thing?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:90%
The big picture?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Do we view it as a
prison or a paradise?

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Is it personal or impersonal?

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:90%
So now we have three periods--

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.070 align:middle line:84%
traditional,
modern, postmodern--

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and we have three
inescapable human problems--

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
nature, society, and
the big picture--

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> The cosmos.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Cosmos, that's good.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so to come back to
the basic point, I think,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:84%
for us in this half hour, is
to realize that each of these

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.150 align:middle line:84%
three periods had
its strong point.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It's genius for doing better
by one of these three problems

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:84%
than did the other two periods,
and, by the same token,

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
doing worse by the
other two problems

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.810 align:middle line:90%
than one of the others--

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>> --others did.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.110 align:middle line:84%
To complete this
overview, I think

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that the modern
period, which saw

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:24.675 align:middle line:84%
the inauguration of modern
science, did best by nature.

00:05:24.675 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean our forebearer
just couldn't come close

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.160 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
have the instruments.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
The postmodern period
has done best, I think,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
with social relationships.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.280 align:middle line:90%
Justice, rights, and so on.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We've seen all of these
social liberation movements

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.295 align:middle line:90%
in the last--

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:50.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> --50 years.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.840 align:middle line:84%
The rise of feminism
and equal rights

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.595 align:middle line:84%
for the various racial and
religious groupings and--

00:05:56.595 --> 00:05:57.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:57.395 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
>> --for people of various
sexual orientations.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're so far
from where we should

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
be that it would be
premature to congratulate,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and yet a simple
look at history shows

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that we are pouring
more energy, we

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:25.250 align:middle line:84%
have more common concern about
that area than the people

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:90%
in the other two periods.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
I would like to come back
to this social justice

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and the fairness
revolution, you might say,

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
but I need to
complete the overview.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.730 align:middle line:84%
So that leaves the
traditional society.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Now what were they good for?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:90%
What were they good at?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Now this is where I think we
make our big mistake today.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Certainly when I was getting
my formal education, why

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:02.330 align:middle line:84%
the traditional people were
referred to as primitive.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We were in the
heyday of progress.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And Auguste Comte set the
stage when he divided all

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
history into the religious,
the metaphysical,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and the scientific, with truth
increasing as you went up

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.510 align:middle line:90%
the scale.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that
is a myth, and

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
that the traditional
peoples did have

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:84%
their virtue and their insight
that we ignore at our peril.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think we've got
the framework before.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I were to summarize
the traditional viewpoint,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.960 align:middle line:84%
it might be something
like the eternal reality--

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.210 align:middle line:84%
the Kingdom of Heaven
is what counts.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
with that comment,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.180 align:middle line:84%
you were very delicately
and deftly completing

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the overview I was trying
to get, because all I said

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
was that the traditional
people had their genius also,

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't say what it was,
and you have filled that in.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the big picture.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think they
understood that intuitively

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and gave it more dignity
than we either the modern

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:90%
or the postmodern people have.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:84%
>> In Western society, it might
be said that this meant living

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
a life in accordance
with God's laws.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
That's one way to
put it, but the theme

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:84%
is the same whatever
the vocabulary.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:90%
In the traditional view--

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
well if I could just
summarize their virtues,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
quickly tick them
off, first they

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:01.730 align:middle line:84%
felt that the world
and we human beings

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
have originated from
something greater than we are.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Call it God, Allah, or Brahman,
or Heaven, or whatever.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So we come trailing clouds
of glory as a poet said.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:90%
Second, that we are the--

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
that spirit is fundamental
and matter is secondary.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like iceberg that
obtrudes in a sea of spirit.

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
As I go through these, I'm
sure and both of our minds

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing how it contrasts
with the modern view

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of the big picture.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:84%
The third we belong
because we are spirit,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
and the world is spirit.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:90%
So we're made of the same thing.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Third-- fourth, everything
is meaningful throughout,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:90%
because a superior being--

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:14.970 align:middle line:84%
the great spirit or something,
however the vocabulary--

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
has power and goodness
coming together.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And it has such power, it
wouldn't make sense for it

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.460 align:middle line:90%
to create a botched product.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So it's all meaningful,
and finally,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:84%
in the traditional view there
is a happy ending to life.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So those are the five
virtues, I think,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that the traditionalists
had a firmer

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
grasp on than we do today,
and it goes without saying,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:84%
but we've implied it, if
each of these three periods

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
had the brilliant
and its downsides,

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
too, why then the
sensible thing is

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to run a net through
our history and lift out

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
the gold in each period
and let the dross sink back

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.730 align:middle line:90%
into the sand--

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful idea.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Huston, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And Huston, you raised
a very interesting point

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:84%
just before our break
that the idea of taking

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
a sieve, of finding the gold
in each of these great world

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
views, the traditional, the
modern, and the postmodern.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
wonderful recognition,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but at the same token, it seems
as if from the perspective

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of any one of these,
the others are no good,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.530 align:middle line:84%
they have a hard time seeing
the gold in each other.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very true.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And I will pick up on
that with our own kind,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:90%
because there's a saying--

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:84%
well, I think it's true
that they old people--

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and I've gotten to the stage
where I'm no longer saying

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm growing old,
I am old, but they

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
are old I always think that
the world is going to the dogs.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I have to remind myself that
there are things about our time

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that we can be very proud
of, and that centers,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
as we have said, in the
Fairness Revolution.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
In 1919, the year
that I was born,

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
an Afro-American was
chained behind bars

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:90%
next to the simian apes.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.880 align:middle line:84%
That couldn't have
been anywhere.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean in a zoo?

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:90%
>> In a zoo.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for filling that in.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.840 align:middle line:90%
In the Brooklyn Zoo, actually.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
That couldn't happen
anywhere in the world today,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.040 align:middle line:84%
there would just
be so much outrage.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And to come a little closer
to home, I was born in China,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.030 align:middle line:84%
as you know, and grew up
there, so I'm a missionary.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1930s, if a street
car was going through San

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Francisco and came to a
stop and there were only

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Chinese-Americans at
the stop, routinely--

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
no Caucasians, routinely
it would just pass them by.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:50.010 align:middle line:84%
I completed my teaching
career at the University

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
of California i Berkeley
where my chancellor

00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:84%
was Chancellor Tien, a very
respected Chinese-American who

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
spoke English with
a decided accent.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Now that's progress
in one lifetime.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the goal here,
and we ought not to overlook.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
There are things about our
time we can be very proud of.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, at the same time, it
strikes me that traditionalists

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:84%
often accuse the modern people
and the postmodern people

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
of having no values at all, no
firm route of being cultural

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.475 align:middle line:84%
relativists and going along
with the flow of things.

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Rather than being
grounded in absolute values.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And you earlier said,
well the scientific--

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
the modern view has shown a deep
understanding of nature, but--

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
An awesome understanding.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> At the same time, we're
destroying the environment.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So one might say they've
missed the best point of all.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's our problem.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Not to see deeply
enough, because all times

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:90%
are ambiguous.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Charles Dickens began his
book, "A Tale of Two Cities,"

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:84%
with the line, it
was the best of times

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
and the worst of times.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I'm inclined
to think you can probably

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.350 align:middle line:84%
say that about every
moment in history,

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
and you brought out that
huge ambiguity of our time.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Good thing-- well,
lots of bad things.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Our problem is, we
dwell on the bad

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and we close our
eyes to the future.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to the good.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It strikes me also, if I
may, that even your description

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
of the traditional
values rings--

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I accept those values
as you've described them,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.490 align:middle line:84%
but I imagine in
traditional times,

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
they were reinforced in a
very authoritarian manner

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:10.380 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
ritual and things that--

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
what we're seeing now may be the
birth of something really new,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.610 align:middle line:84%
something authentically
mystical, something

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
authentically scientific
and authentically grounded

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
in an appreciation
for justice that

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.000 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be any of those three.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're back
to the product.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
If we pass a sieve through
these three periods,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and you were looking ahead
bright-eyed to this golden age

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:47.970 align:middle line:84%
where the virtue of each
period will be harmonized

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and integrated,
and the shadow side

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:90%
will be let fall to the past.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
>> They're all pretty
good at seeing the shadow

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
of the others.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the nature.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] That's our
tendency, mm-hmm.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I understand your
life's work correctly, Huston,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.980 align:middle line:84%
it's seeing the common
threads that runs through

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.410 align:middle line:84%
the world's great
spiritual traditions.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And if I understand those
common threads in a nutshell,

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
correct me if I'm wrong, but
I think what they define is

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:90%
the great mystical traditions.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine in religious
study told me something.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
He said, Huston, there's
a rumor going around

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that Huston can't really
be trusted because he's

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.310 align:middle line:90%
got this optical defect--

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:90%
he sees unity everywhere.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.800 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] And I admit
to that, that I

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.880 align:middle line:90%
like to see commonalities.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I do know
notice that, and I

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
do believe that what unites
these traditions, which are

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.930 align:middle line:90%
very different on the surface--

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.770 align:middle line:84%
obviously they're
not carbon copies,

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:84%
and my book on their differences
is three times as big

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it's on their unity,
but I love the unity

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that I tried to lift out
in "Forgotten Truth."

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you rightly
say, behind them

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
all is this mystical
strain of there being

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:47.680 align:middle line:84%
another reality which
transcends our possibility

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
of conceptualizing clearly,
but which nevertheless we

00:18:54.010 --> 00:19:00.310 align:middle line:84%
can point to like fingers
pointing to the moon.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The distance between the tip
of the finger and the moon

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
is very great, but nevertheless,
the angle can be right.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's very important.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:84%
It strikes me that that mystical
sense that we can point to,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
we sometimes call it spirit, it
can be the ground or the basis,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.720 align:middle line:84%
the realm that informs
our inquiries into nature

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and our sense of
justice and society.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It comes back to the point
which the traditionalists

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.490 align:middle line:84%
were-- this is one
other good thing--

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:48.160 align:middle line:84%
they realized that we are
the product of something

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:90%
that is greater than we are.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And that infuses
life with dignity

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
that it would be a mistake
for us to overlook.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:05.500 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The postmodern era that we've
experienced for the last 50

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:84%
years, it's sometimes associated
with the word deconstruct.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:90%
That's very true.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And we've already pointed out
very clearly and appreciatively

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:32.710 align:middle line:84%
to its genius in giving
concern to social justice.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some post-colonial
guilt mixed in there,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
never mind the
result is very good.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.010 align:middle line:84%
But with regard to
the big picture,

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that's one of the places
where postmodernism has not

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
done well, because they want
to take things apart rather

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.113 align:middle line:90%
than putting them together.

00:20:57.113 --> 00:21:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Now both processes
are important,

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:05.740 align:middle line:84%
but we shouldn't forget that
it's easier to smash your face

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%
than it is to create it.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And the basic
mistake is to think

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
that overviews, the
metaphysical views of the whole,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%
the big picture are oppressive.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Now granted they can be,
but the postmoderns have not

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated that
they have to be,

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we need to
bring their good point--

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
social justice--
together with an overview

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.410 align:middle line:84%
on the view of
reality that would

both inspire us and unite us.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when I
think of overviews,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:90%
I often think of metaphysics.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I know earlier when you
refer to Auguste Comte,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
you said he distinguished
between the traditional era

00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.600 align:middle line:90%
and the metaphysical era.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you-- do you see
that as a valid distinction?

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:84%
His three were the
religious, the metaphysical,

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%
and the scientific.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So the metaphysical, he in
his view of progress felt was

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
better than the religious,
but it was inferior

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:90%
to the scientific.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So the only world view
that his scheme allowed is

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the scientific world view,
but as we know or are coming

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
to know, it can deal only
with the physical universe.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Huston, I'm going to
have to interrupt you,

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
we're running out
of time once again.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:90%
We have eternal conversations--

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're immortals in
Heaven, we'll still be--

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll probably be doing this.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks so much for being
with me, it's been a joy.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's like
heavenly here.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
