00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:10%
Today we're going to pose the
eternal question, what is time?

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.750 align:middle line:84%
And my guest, Dr. Charles
Muses is certainly

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.130 align:middle line:90%
an expert in this area.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:84%
A mathematician, philosopher,
and computer scientist.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.800 align:middle line:84%
The author of numerous
books and articles,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
including Destiny and Control
in Human Systems and the Lion

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:90%
Path.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:90%
Charles, welcome.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure to have
you on the program.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to be here, Jeffrey.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in your book you
describe time in ways that are

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:90%
rather untraditional.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
You suggest that time
is multi-dimensional,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
and also that time
is qualitative.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Could you give an
example of what

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
you mean by the
qualitative nature of time?

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, actually
this is quite traditional.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.690 align:middle line:84%
But you have to go
back quite a way

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.760 align:middle line:90%
before it becomes traditional.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible to make
it traditional again only

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.850 align:middle line:90%
with quantum physics.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.910 align:middle line:10%
The idea being, I suppose,
to imagine a person

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.740 align:middle line:10%
in a rather routine job.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Say in a bank or some
civil service work,

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.110 align:middle line:90%
where they are doing something--

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:84%
much the same thing every
day, with the same group.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But you'll hear them
say, oh, today everything

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:90%
was just wrong.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Everything went wrong today.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:90%
Or today everything was smooth.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So time itself,
independent of the people,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
independently of the
situation, has equality.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Now I might challenge that.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Because your example doesn't
really demonstrate that to me.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.450 align:middle line:84%
It almost suggests
that the guy, maybe he

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.280 align:middle line:84%
had something bad for
breakfast that day.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the kind of a day I mean
is where everything goes wrong

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:90%
with everybody.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:90%
The boss is screaming.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:84%
The different
employees have a fight.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
There are-- actresses and
actors can tell this too.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
That audiences are different.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Not that it can't be overcome.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.010 align:middle line:90%
But there are wave motions.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
It would be just
as, I suppose, as

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:84%
reasonable to say that the
oceans should have tides.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tides, I suppose must
be a reflection of time and--

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> In some sense.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Time and tide.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Tide comes from the word time.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that right?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Time and tide--

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now one of the things
that you're saying reminds me

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.890 align:middle line:90%
of, say the Santa Ana winds.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
They come in off the desert
into Southern California.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:90%
They're hot and dry.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They carry many positive
ions, which cause

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:90%
people to get uptight, nervous.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
More traffic accidents,
mental illness.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
But would you ascribe that
to the nature of time itself?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have the
fern wind in Switzerland,

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:90%
you have the siroco in Morocco.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:90%
You can predict the seasons.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.645 align:middle line:84%
That's perhaps the simplest
kind of chronotopology.

00:02:52.645 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You could predict to
someone that if they

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.550 align:middle line:84%
went to sufficiently northern
or southern latitude,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.025 align:middle line:84%
without proper preparation,
without the proper clothing,

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:90%
they would freeze to death.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.620 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I
should mention here--

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.495 align:middle line:90%
>> At a certain time.

00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Since you've used that
term, chronotopology,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:84%
that's the name of the
discipline which you founded,

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the study of
the structure of time.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you want
me to comment on that?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>> yes, please.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way, yes.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:90%
But in a way, I didn't found it.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking
cybernetics, for instance,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.200 align:middle line:84%
was started formally
by Norbert Wiener,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.165 align:middle line:84%
but it began with the toilet
tank that controlled itself.

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:29.015 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah-ha.

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:29.815 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And when I was talking
with Wiener at Rivello,

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:90%
he happily agreed with this.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> The toilet tank.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And he says, oh, yes, the
self-shutting off toilet tank--

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the first cybernetic
advance of mankind.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And I suppose chronotopology
has an illustrious beginning

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:90%
like this also?

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, better than the
toilet tank actually.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
It has a better beginning
than cybernetics.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it, in effect does
it go back to the study

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient astrologers?

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it goes back to the
study of almost all traditional

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.890 align:middle line:90%
cultures.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The word astronomia, even
the word mathematicos,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
meant someone who
studied the stars.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And in Kepler's sense, they
calculated the positions

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to know the qualities of time.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
But that's an
independent hypothesis.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.320 align:middle line:84%
The hypothesis of
chronotopology is whether you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
have pointers of any kind.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Ionospheric disturbances,
planetary orbits, or whatnot.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Independently of those pointers,
time itself has a flux,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:90%
has a wave motion.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.106 align:middle line:84%
And the object being
to surf on time.

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> When you talk about
the wave motion of time,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting real
interested and excited.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Because in quantum
physics, there

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.400 align:middle line:84%
is this notion of the underlying
basis of the physical universe,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
or these waves, even
probability waves, nonphysical,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:90%
nonmaterial waves, sort of--

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very, very astute,
because these waves are

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%
standing waves.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Actually the wave
particle so-called paradox

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.440 align:middle line:84%
isn't that bad, when you
consider that a particle is

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:90%
a wave packet.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
A packet of standing waves.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's why an electron
can go through a plate

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:90%
and leave wave-like things.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And actually our bodies
are like fountains.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
The fountain has a
shape only because it's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.595 align:middle line:90%
being renewed every minute.

00:05:17.595 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies
are being renewed.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:90%
So we are standing waves.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:90%
We're no exception.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And this deep structure
of matter, where we can say,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, what we really are
in our bodies is not what we

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:90%
appear to be.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.480 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the same
thing is true about time?

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.280 align:middle line:84%
It's not quite what
it appears to be.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we're a part of
this wave structure.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And matter and energy
all occur in waves.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.233 align:middle line:90%
And time is the master control.

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I will give you an
illustration of that.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
If you take a moment
of time, this moment

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.940 align:middle line:84%
cuts through the entire physical
universe as we're talking.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.170 align:middle line:90%
It holds all of space in itself.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.645 align:middle line:84%
But one point of space
doesn't hold all of time.

00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So its time is much
bigger than space.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.700 align:middle line:84%
>> That thought is sort of
making me gasp a second.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.430 align:middle line:84%
All of physical space
in each now moment--

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is contained in a point
of time, which is a moment.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And of course a line of
time then is an occurrence.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And a wave of time
is a recurrence.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
And then if you get out from the
circle of time, which Nietzsche

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:90%
saw, the eternal recurrence.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
If you break that, as we
know we do, we develop.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:90%
And then we're on a helix.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Because we come around, but it's
a little different each time.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well now you're beginning
to introduce the notion

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:90%
of symbols.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Point, line, wave--

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Helix.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> The dimensions of time.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And so on.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.273 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting
points that you

00:06:36.273 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:84%
seem to make in your book is
that symbols themselves, words,

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
pictures, point to the deeper
structure of things, including

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.300 align:middle line:90%
the deeper structure of time.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Symbols I would regard as
pointers to their meanings,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.352 align:middle line:90%
like revolving doors.

00:06:53.352 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:84%
There are some people, however,
who spend their whole lives

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.227 align:middle line:84%
walking in the revolving door
and never getting out of it.

00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you explain
that a little more?

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they dote
on symbols per se,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
without ever getting
to the signatum.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Confuse the map for the
territory, so to speak.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.780 align:middle line:84%
>> They get stuck
in the map, yes.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have to regard a symbol
as a revolving door, the point

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of which is to walk through
and not get stuck in it.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And then help other
people to get through.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
But a symbol is very
useful, no question.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
But you can get caught
in a revolving door.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.770 align:middle line:90%
You have to be careful.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:25.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Now we've talked--

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.000 align:middle line:84%
I've jumped a little
bit, because we

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:84%
talked about this sort of
wave form property of matter

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:90%
and of time.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.890 align:middle line:90%
And then we went into symbols.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you
can connect that--

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you need symbols to
handle much of these concepts.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Because we have words.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.105 align:middle line:90%
This is the basic language.

00:07:42.105 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:84%
And then, as everybody
knows, and most people

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:84%
are very petrified about,
you have mathematics.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's taught, I must
say, pretty much wrongly

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.780 align:middle line:84%
in the elementary
grades, and that's

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
why the average
person is afraid.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
The moment you say
mathematics, oh, my god, I

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.547 align:middle line:90%
could never understand that.

00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of
the great languages.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's poetry.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
I asked a graduate class
in Oregon a question,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.160 align:middle line:84%
reminding them that the Greeks
had said, there was nothing--

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:84%
could be nothing
less than nothing,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.907 align:middle line:84%
and therefore negative
numbers couldn't exist.

00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:12.948 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean like minus 1?

00:08:12.948 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Couldn't exist.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And I said, we all
know we have debts.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
We all know we can make
a car go in reverse.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Prove, now, though, prove
that the Greeks were wrong.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't do it.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't prove it.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.980 align:middle line:10%
I didn't ask them to say
that they were wrong,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:10%
but show how they--
well, they were wrong

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:10%
because the Greeks were
confusing two things, which

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:10%
we are confusing.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:37.020 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of a ruler
is not the first inch.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
How many inches-- may
I ask you a question?

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the inches at
the beginning of a ruler?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The inches at the
beginning-- you know,

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:90%
you've really lost me.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.548 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind of in a puzzle here.

00:08:44.548 --> 00:08:46.680 align:middle line:84%
The inch at the beginning
of the ruler is zero.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And the horse race
doesn't begin at one mile.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Begins at the starting line.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:90%
So zero is as real as one.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Because the edge of the ruler
is as real is the first inch.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.095 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks confused
zero and nothing.

00:08:59.095 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.945 align:middle line:84%
>> They were perfectly wrong
to say there's nothing--

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:04.820 align:middle line:90%
right to say, rather.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.710 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
less than nothing.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:84%
But wrong to say that that means
there's nothing less than zero.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But you're saying something
a little deeper here.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying zero and
nothing are not the same.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> What you seem also
to be implying, Charles,

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
is that in our modern-day
world, some of our thinking is

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
as illogical as the Greeks,
even though we pride ourselves

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:84%
on having a logical,
rational culture.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Using the word illogical,
what I said to these students

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
is, don't think that you were
stupid in not being able to see

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.470 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.810 align:middle line:90%
You have been badly conditioned.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is the basis, really,

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of what the world calls
brilliant thinking.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It's to get into the unfamiliar.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Actually it can be
quite simple, like 0

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:90%
is the beginning of the ruler.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.848 align:middle line:90%
But it's unfamiliar.

00:09:42.848 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
Because we've been conditioned.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The teacher says she
takes the apples away,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:90%
and that's no apples.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's the same as zero.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.830 align:middle line:90%
2 minus 2 equals zero.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we conditioned in
the same way about time?

00:09:52.882 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:10%
>> So we have to be careful
of all our conditionings.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.930 align:middle line:10%
Most of us, yes.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:10%
Most of us are conditioned
in the Western world

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.790 align:middle line:10%
of a completely linear time.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Where as, some
other cultures, they

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:90%
have a much more circular time.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, we live our
lives from birth to death.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.823 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that sort of
a linear picture?

00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a linear picture,
unless you go, of course,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
to the Buddhist or
the Hindu picture,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:84%
which says death is
a beginning again.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
some Islamic texts,

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:84%
death is the beginning
of a journey.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.230 align:middle line:84%
The 13th Article
of the Hebrew creed

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:31.950 align:middle line:90%
of Maimonides immortality.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me just throw an
image of mine at you,

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.102 align:middle line:90%
and if you can relate to this--

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:36.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I sometimes
wonder about time.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Is, for example--
if the now moment

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%
were the only real moment.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.860 align:middle line:84%
That is, the past
no longer exists.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:90%
The future now longer exists.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:90%
So I see myself.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I have a physical body
in the now moment.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:90%
Two arms, two legs.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But if the past were somehow
real, then where did yesterday

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
go, after all?

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Then my body would begin to look
like, almost like a long snake.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And these two arms and two legs
would just be the front of it.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And it would sort of
be snaking around,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
as if I were to draw a
picture on a map of everywhere

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:08.730 align:middle line:90%
I travel today.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
So that in some sense,
if we look at the past,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
we wouldn't even
look the way we look

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:90%
if we saw time differently.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Very, very poetic idea.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Am I totally off base?

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:90%
How do you relate to that?

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.542 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you're not at all.

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Using an image, of course.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.487 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't have to
show up in the body.

00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:25.380 align:middle line:84%
But the past does
exist in the present.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
But in a different way.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.750 align:middle line:90%
It exists as memory.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And the future exists as
desire, or anticipation.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.336 align:middle line:90%
But they are always in the now.

00:11:33.336 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
There's no contradiction,
in other words.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:90%
The past is there.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.630 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
and I are the result

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:84%
of previous acts we
did, previous habits.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.130 align:middle line:84%
We're also the result
of the desires.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The future is impressing
itself on us right now.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
mentioned in my book,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
there's feedback
from the future.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
that a little more.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
The feedback in terms
of our own desires.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:90%
What about precognition?

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:84%
What about anticipating
or prophecy?

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:90%
Premonitions.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You're getting
into paranormal.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I meant even
ordinary desires.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'll return
to your question.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to go
by easier stages.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Even an ordinary desire--

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:84%
if you take away the future from
people, the desire, and I've

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:90%
seen this done under hypnosis.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.950 align:middle line:84%
The person goes into
terrible melancholy.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely nothing.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.190 align:middle line:84%
>> No goals, nothing
to look forward to.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No, nothing.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We live more than we
realize in our desires.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.380 align:middle line:90%
Unachieved.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:90%
In fact--

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.222 align:middle line:90%
>> That's our motivation.

00:12:27.222 --> 00:12:28.247 align:middle line:90%
It propels us as we--

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Schopenhauer pushed
that to the limit and said,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.012 align:middle line:84%
once you achieve
it, you're bored.

00:12:33.012 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of truth in that.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:84%
>> They climb the
mountain only to be there,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
then they look for
another mountain.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> A good example of that
would be people who retire,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.665 align:middle line:90%
and find that they die.

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:42.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:43.030 align:middle line:90%
Too soon.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:90%
People--

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> You should
really never retire.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Live 18 to 24 months after--

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a ghastly system.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So you're quite right that the
future exists in our desires,

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.670 align:middle line:90%
in our anticipations.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And in a very literal sense.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And we are realizing
it all the time.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And the past does too
in terms of our habits.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.346 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I have another idea about
the past I'd like to share with

00:13:02.346 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
you.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, go ahead, please.

00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:06.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of the past as
sort of a big treasure house,

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.950 align:middle line:84%
or sort of like in
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I know you've written
about these fantasy games--

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> In your book.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's monsters, and there's
jewels and riches in the past.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we moved
into the present--

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
into the future
from the present--

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
we have the power to take with
us what we want out of the past

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and to leave the
other stuff there.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
If we had times when we
felt bad about ourselves

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.830 align:middle line:84%
or when our past was
harmful or hurtful to us,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.400 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to keep
recalling that in our mind.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:90%
We can leave it where it lay.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>> No, we don't have to keep
recalling-- quite right,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
with one little proviso.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:10%
We still must work through it
in terms of the unconscious

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.560 align:middle line:10%
habits it's set up.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what the
Lion Path is about.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:84%
The acceleration of the
dissolution of karma,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:90%
so to speak, or a consequence.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you brought
up the Lion Path.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you could elaborate
on that a little bit more.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that takes off
from chapter 5 of Destiny

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and Control.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And goes into practical
methods of how-- exactly

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.210 align:middle line:84%
what you were
bringing up, Jeffrey.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
How to handle the
past within us.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
How to take what we want,
how to work through what

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.495 align:middle line:90%
we don't want and then leave it.

00:14:13.495 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I might mention, for the
sake of our viewers, Charles,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.720 align:middle line:84%
that I think those two books
are some of the most intriguing,

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
interesting books
I've ever read.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.717 align:middle line:84%
Extremely erudite
and provocative.

00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:25.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Glad you feel that way,
though the word erudite might

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.850 align:middle line:90%
be put off.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:29.033 align:middle line:84%
I tried to-- in fact, there are
four letter words in chapter 5.

00:14:29.033 --> 00:14:29.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.287 align:middle line:90%
We tried to make it lively.

00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:90%
It is a very lively thing.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It's life itself.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you're drawing
scholarship that includes

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.640 align:middle line:84%
ancient religions and history
and combines that with a lot

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.972 align:middle line:90%
of mathematics--

00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:41.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially when you
go off the beaten track.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
But as a physician
told me in London,

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.473 align:middle line:84%
he had written a book on
regression under hypnosis.

00:14:47.473 --> 00:14:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And I suspected there
was something more

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:90%
than he was writing about.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So I made an
appointment with him.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.080 align:middle line:90%
Flew up to London.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:90%
I was at Malta at that time.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you must have meant
something more in this case.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.660 align:middle line:84%
He said, oh, yes, this
woman was very gifted.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.110 align:middle line:84%
She came to me with what I
diagnosed as gastric ulceritis

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:90%
of psychosomatic origin.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.663 align:middle line:90%
And she regressed very easily.

00:15:07.663 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So he said, I did-- what I
didn't write about in the book,

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.430 align:middle line:84%
I regressed her beyond the
womb, beyond her fetal stage.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And she went into a
period of blankness,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:84%
and then she woke up amid
characteristically black

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Bedouin tents, which
are in North Africa.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And this happened
again and again.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So I said, would you
say that was the memory

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.820 align:middle line:90%
of a previous existence?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
He said, well-- he said,
take from it what you will,

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.680 align:middle line:90%
but I couldn't publish it.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
My associates in Harley Street
would have drowned me out.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there are many
books out now with--

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.255 align:middle line:10%
>> So one has to be--

00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.500 align:middle line:10%


00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:10%
You have to be very careful to--

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:10%
when you go beyond the
bounds of the known,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:10%
to substantiate
everything doubly.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.418 align:middle line:84%
So that's all that the
scholarship is for.

00:15:50.418 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But the readers
didn't have to bother

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:90%
with if they didn't want to.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, let's get back
to the Lion Path again.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.120 align:middle line:84%
You're taking off from chapter
5 of Destiny and Control,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:84%
which as I recall, is the
practical applications

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.460 align:middle line:84%
of understanding the
structure of time.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And how we got into predatory
time instead of symbiotic time.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You better explain that.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the key to our nature
system is who eats whom.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.155 align:middle line:90%
And we have peace movements.

00:16:19.155 --> 00:16:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We say peace is wonderful
all over the world,

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
but nature doesn't believe us.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:90%
Nature is not at peace.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Nature is at constant
war, to the death.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
But with another side, a
completely symbiotic side.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Where the plants
breathe out oxygen,

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
we breathe in oxygen. We breathe
out carbon dioxide, they do it.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's beauty, and then
this predatory quality.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
There is this very,
very blood and tooth

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:90%
and claw quality about it.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:90%
And it needn't have been.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So it arises, the
question arises,

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
if we as good
scientists could have

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:84%
planned a symbiotic biology,
what went wrong, if anything?

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So these are the questions
that chapter 5 tries to probe.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And what-- are you suggesting
in the Lion Path is that there

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
is an evolution towards
something other than this--

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Dog-eat-dog, man-eat-man--

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
Yes, there is an evolution
toward a completely symbiotic

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
state, and the thesis is
that human beings are not

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.010 align:middle line:90%
the last stage in evolution.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It would be absurd to think
they were, looking around us.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But that there are
vistas beyond us.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:90%
A dog can look above and below.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
He can look down at an oyster
and think it's very stupid.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Look up to his master
like a semi god.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
We can only look down.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is,
we can also look up.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And we have to find out where
these advanced stages are.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And are you also suggesting
that through disciplines,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can somehow direct
or control our own evolution?

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the
next step for man.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Man is the only creature capable
of symbolic manipulation.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.313 align:middle line:84%
And capable of this
kind of control.

00:17:52.313 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're trying to do
it with genetic engineering.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.980 align:middle line:84%
But they're going at
it from the material

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.997 align:middle line:84%
side rather than from the
psychic side, from the mind.

00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think it can be
done through the mind.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, of course, taught
that for many years.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk a little
bit about the mind.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.983 align:middle line:84%
Because we've been
talking about time.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:11.615 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking about space
and matter and symbolism.

00:18:11.615 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
I gather from your
writing, that you're

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.300 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that the
mind is part of a sort

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
of a non-physical reality,
a mathematically definable

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:84%
A reality that can interface and
interact with physical reality.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And in which physical
reality is embedded.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very well put.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, only with quantum
physics could we say this.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But there can be some things
which are physically effective,

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:90%
which are not physical.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you give me--

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I can give
you an illustration.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:90%
A very recondite one.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:84%
But there's what-- there
is called zero point

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.500 align:middle line:90%
energy of the vacuum.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And the vacuum is defined
in quantum physics

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:55.445 align:middle line:84%
as a space devoid of
radiation or matter.

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:90%
No energy, no matter.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Yet there's an inherent
energy in there,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.350 align:middle line:90%
which can be measured.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the great
triumphs of modern physics.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.710 align:middle line:90%
And that's physically affective.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> The energy of a pure vacuum--

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it obviously
isn't a pure vacuum.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.410 align:middle line:84%
The savage would say, to us
the so-called savage would say,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:90%
the room is empty.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:90%
And the wind is a magic spirit.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.060 align:middle line:90%
But we know it's air.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So we are like the savage in
saying the vacuum is empty.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
There's something there.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Used to be called the ethers.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.587 align:middle line:84%
And then it became
out of fashion.

00:19:26.587 --> 00:19:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Then Dirac brought it back
again, because he had to.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
evacuate a bell jar

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and put a compass
needle in there,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and then put on
an electromagnet,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:90%
the compass needle moved.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:84%
What pushed it is
the good question.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.225 align:middle line:90%
They don't know yet.

00:19:39.225 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:90%
Nobody knows.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And-- this is a
very profound notion.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Because in effect,
what we're saying

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:49.470 align:middle line:84%
is this invisible,
completely nonmaterial fabric

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.680 align:middle line:90%
of a vacuum is--

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:84%
is the stuff out of which the
physical universe is created.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And can be effective in it.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So people who are
reductionists, who suggest,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
for example, that the mind
is made out of matter.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.912 align:middle line:84%
That our minds are
really our brains.

00:20:04.912 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
If we go further,
and we say, well,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.453 align:middle line:90%
what is the brain made of?

00:20:07.453 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The brain is made of,
in effect, a vacuum.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:90%
I spoke to one of these people.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
I-- in fact, a chapter
of mine on the interface

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.250 align:middle line:84%
between biology
and quantum physics

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
is coming out in a book
being published by plenum

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:90%
called Self Organization.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.895 align:middle line:84%
And I said to this
chap, who happened

00:20:23.895 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to be the editor, I
said, why are you getting

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:84%
so excited about my opposing
your reductionism if you're

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:90%
just lifeless matter?

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:90%
Why would you be so angry?

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
characteristic of matter.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:90%
This is mind.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.750 align:middle line:10%
So, also Konrad Lorenz
said an interesting point

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.450 align:middle line:10%
I was fortunate enough to have
a very enjoyable dinner with him

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:10%
and he as you know,
is a physician.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
He was trained also as a
Jesuit, and he's a Darwinist.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation went
to precisely this point.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him, would he agree
that a white blood cell was

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:90%
an amoeba, specialized amoeba?

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And then you asked him if
a neuron might also be--

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you remember
that conversation.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:07.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it was very interesting.

00:21:07.645 --> 00:21:10.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the neuron be a still
more specialized amoeba with

00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:10.903 align:middle line:90%
fixed pseudopods?

00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:13.195 align:middle line:84%
He thought a little way along,
he said, yes, of course.

00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:10%
And I said, then you're
deriving human intelligence

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:10%
from amoebas.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:10%
But you've just
said, by Darwinism,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:10%
that we've evolved
far above them.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.742 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:22.950 align:middle line:84%
So then he said, well, it's
the way they've arranged.

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:90%
>> The organization.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.403 align:middle line:84%
>> But you can arrange morons
any way you want in a room.

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
You don't get anything
more out of them.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.230 align:middle line:84%
You need an operator to impose
a program on the morons.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So your point is, in
effect, that the brain,

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:90%
being composed of these simple--

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Very simple.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:90%
One-celled animals.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:37.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Relatively simple neurons.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.938 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the brain is,
I think, we'd all agree,

00:21:39.938 --> 00:21:40.896 align:middle line:90%
an exquisite structure.

00:21:40.896 --> 00:21:41.696 align:middle line:90%
So you're saying--

00:21:41.696 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a transducer,
that's what I'm saying.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.252 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying there must have
been some other intelligence

00:21:46.252 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:90%
that created the brain.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
>> There must be-- there must
be something operating it as we

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:90%
talk.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.660 align:middle line:84%
>> The notion of self
organization doesn't satisfy

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:90%
you in this--

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.863 align:middle line:84%
>> No, not when the self is the
one-celled animals are supposed

00:21:56.863 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:84%
to pull themselves up
by their own bootstraps.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But Charles, when we're
looking at the nature

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and structure of time, there's
so many threads to the fabric.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
There's our brain,
there's our language.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
There's the structure
of matter itself.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And all of these various wave
forms to which you referred.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
You seem to be implying that
it's possible for human beings

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to get a grip on
all of these things,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to have a handle on all
of these various facets,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:84%
using some very sophisticated
version of systems theory,

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.710 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the way the
book had to be written,

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:32.460 align:middle line:90%
and it is that way.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.230 align:middle line:90%
But that's a post hoc thing.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.970 align:middle line:84%
The real way you
get a handle on it

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
is not through the intellect,
but through the feelings.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the poet
grasps the world as a whole

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.690 align:middle line:84%
much more accurately
and profoundly

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.820 align:middle line:90%
than the average scientist.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm really saying.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And that the human being
has to filter things

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.400 align:middle line:84%
through the heart,
through the emotions,

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
before the logic even
gives assent to it.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking with even
a very intelligent man, if

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.420 align:middle line:84%
he-- or a woman--
if he or she is

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
against what you
say emotionally,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.360 align:middle line:90%
you can talk all night.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:90%
The logic won't avail.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's the emotions where the
key to human development lies,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.240 align:middle line:90%
rather than the intellect.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you then going a step
further and suggesting that,

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.780 align:middle line:10%
if we can cultivate this
emotional sensitivity

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:10%
to the rhythms and the
cycles and patterns of time,

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:24.200 align:middle line:10%
that this may have
practical benefit for us

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:10%
in our government and our
culture and our businesses?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.550 align:middle line:90%
It would eliminate fear.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:90%
It would increase our intellect.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.720 align:middle line:84%
For instance, you can train
a dog through affection

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
much better than you can
train it through fear.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Its intelligence will
develop with affection.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Everybody who has a dog
knows that and loves them.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:41.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And in making
business decisions--

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas with fear, which
is the basis of present-day

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
governments-- thou
shalt not do this.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.272 align:middle line:84%
If you do this,
you'll get a fine.

00:23:47.272 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:90%
If you don't pay this--

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Much of the marketplaces is--

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all fear.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Driven by fear as well.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying is
that fear is paralytic.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to call it love,
but not in a sentimental sense,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:84%
like a cosmic
power, is unfolding.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.560 align:middle line:90%
Is a blossoming effect.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we need.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Children, of course,
immediately respond to that.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.940 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:84%
If you try fear, you'll
just lock them up.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Also the feeble-minded,
also people

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
who tend to be
neurotic or psychotic.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.490 align:middle line:84%
They all respond
negatively to fear.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Would I be too crass to try
to push your argument in this

00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
direction, to say,
let's suppose--

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.283 align:middle line:90%
>> No, push away.

00:24:24.283 --> 00:24:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>> You haven't heard me yet.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:90%
But suppose--

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't mind.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm buying or selling
stocks, bonds, commodities.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the market
place of the world.

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm in business.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
Would you recommend
that I cultivate

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
a sense of emotional
relationship to the market?

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Try and feel a group mind to
what other people are doing?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.280 align:middle line:90%
The cycles of time?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:90%
Is--

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one for one thing the
cycles could be calculated.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:84%
But where I inculcate
the emotions

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is when you're dealing
with human beings.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The stock market, of course, is
a reflection of human beings.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's not dealing
directly with them.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So I would say it was
a misplaced analogy.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
But the stock market cycles
can be studied, yes, indeed.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But they go and turn
back to emotional cycles.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Because when people lose
faith in a business,

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.160 align:middle line:84%
or in a given money,
the stock market drops.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
Even if the money
still has value.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.430 align:middle line:90%
Or the business has value.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a psychological overlay
on the stock market of emotion.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> What are the directions--

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.590 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about the further
evolution of the human being,

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:84%
which seems sort of
very lofty and really,

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
in a way, spiritual.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.372 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the other directions

00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
in which chronotopology, the
discipline that you've named,

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.630 align:middle line:90%
is moving today?

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, getting teams together.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Choosing teams that
can work well together.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.740 align:middle line:84%
That have destiny patterns
that would harmonize.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.000 align:middle line:84%
You'd cut down very much
on airplane accidents.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Team building.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Team building.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And putting those who are--
even insurance companies

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:84%
have learned there are people
who are accident prone.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
They don't know why,
but they know it.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you'd get, maybe,
only one of these on a team.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Don't put the
majority of accident

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
prone people
together on one team.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.790 align:middle line:90%
And then you steer away events.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the theory, you
would actually steer away.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the event is attracted
to the type of destiny

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.997 align:middle line:90%
pattern of the person.

00:26:17.997 --> 00:26:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Have you-- you may
have often wondered

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.400 align:middle line:84%
why the victims of
many horrible crimes

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:84%
are usually, very often,
very nice, innocent people.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.967 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Hindu theory saying
that they must have been very

00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
bad in some past life, and
therefore deserve this,

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.842 align:middle line:84%
doesn't hold up when
you look at the cases.

00:26:34.842 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:84%
The victims usually
have, pitifully,

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.810 align:middle line:90%
innocent, often naive.

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you see lightning
going through a sky,

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and it seems very zigzag,
what it's actually doing

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.440 align:middle line:90%
is not zigzagging at all.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.420 align:middle line:84%
It's finding the place of least
resistance through the air.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a structure.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So if a person has no
resistance around them,

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.405 align:middle line:84%
then the evil
lightning can stri--

00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:84%
the will of somebody
who's destructive

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.280 align:middle line:90%
can find them better.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.230 align:middle line:90%
This is the theory.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Charles, it's been a
pleasure having you with us

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:90%
on the program.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.910 align:middle line:84%
We've really covered
a lot of ground,

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.180 align:middle line:84%
from quantum physics
to poetry, to history.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks to your questions.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you very much
for being with us.

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Pleasure.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you, as well,
for being with us today.
