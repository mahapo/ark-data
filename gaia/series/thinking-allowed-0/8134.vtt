Conversations on the leading

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:84%
with psychologist
Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to explore
aging, change, and dying.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.620 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Ram Dass,
author of many books,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.530 align:middle line:84%
including "Be Here Now," "Still
Here," "Grist for the Mill,"

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:90%
"How can I Help?"

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Ram Dass has been
a cultural pioneer

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.990 align:middle line:84%
as part of the
spiritual renaissance,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.060 align:middle line:84%
part of the human
potential movement,

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.250 align:middle line:84%
part of the
psychedelic movement,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
and a great
inspiration to millions

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
of people such as myself, part
of the Baby Boom generation.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
In recent years, he
has suffered a stroke,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.160 align:middle line:84%
so this will be a bit
of an unusual program,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:84%
and if there are pauses
during the conversation,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.160 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to use
them as opportunities

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
to enter deeply into
our conversation

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:90%
in a meditative way.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Ram Dass.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.415 align:middle line:84%
You write now more
eloquently about the soul.

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
That part of us that is
larger than our bodies.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And you make a point of
saying, interestingly,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:84%
not that we are not
our bodies, because we

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
are very much our bodies,
but we are more than that.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I guess, an
important awareness as we

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.043 align:middle line:84%
get older and face the
types of things that occur.

00:01:56.043 --> 00:01:59.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:10%
By my identifying
with my soul, I

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:10%
didn't take the
brunt of this illness

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:10%
because the soul doesn't have
illnesses, a soul doesn't die,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.530 align:middle line:10%
and it's a nice
place to identify.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things about
which you write is that before

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
your stroke, you didn't have the
same understanding that you do

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
now about what it
means to face the--

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to face death and to face
the real fear of losing

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.740 align:middle line:90%
one's physical capacities.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> This book that
I've written now,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:84%
this one called "Still Here,"
I had done about three-quarters

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
of it before I stroked,
and it was somehow of a--

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
distant from the--
distant from aging itself.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And I kept having thoughts,
if I could only get into the--

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
being an aging person, but I was
only 65, and I kept wishing--

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
wishing to be an old
man for this book,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.090 align:middle line:90%
because it was a book on age.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.209 align:middle line:84%
And I was in bed,
and I got a feeling--

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I was really envisioning
I was an old man.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And the phone rang, and I
stood up to go to the phone,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.420 align:middle line:90%
and my leg went out.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the phone and the
person on the other end, they--

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.260 align:middle line:84%
my voice was funny, and he
said, are you all right?

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't trust it, so he
was calling from another place,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and he called my secretaries,
told them to come over

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:90%
because I was sick.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And they came over and then
they found me on the floor.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, all that happened
was I was becoming aged.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think of sickness.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And they saw an aged person on--

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't understand
it was just aged.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:53.440 align:middle line:84%
So they 911'd it, and
next, central casting

00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
sent over 10 firemen
looking at this old man.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
I was watching from
the side of the room.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And then they transferred me
to an ambulance and hospital

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:90%
and it seemed strange.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.278 align:middle line:90%


00:06:20.278 --> 00:06:21.445 align:middle line:90%
I was just being an old man.

00:06:21.445 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:90%
And that was-- it was--

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that was initially the
way I had the stroke.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You had no idea.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.000 align:middle line:90%
And-- no.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't-- it was--

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:04.680 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the doctors said that
I was probably going to die,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and that I had a massive
stroke and stuff like that.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they told it to
all my friends and--

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
the-- each other.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And as I looked--

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:90%
all of the faces looked serious.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:90%
My friends looked serious.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.340 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't tell me.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:49.155 align:middle line:10%
And I was looking at the
pipes on the ceiling.

00:07:49.155 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And here, I've sat next to
beds with dying people--

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Many times.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Many times.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And I always feel
spiritual, therefore,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and I assume that the dying
person feels spiritual, too.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And there I was dying,
and not spiritual at all--

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Just looking at the pipes.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, a fine thing.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.700 align:middle line:90%
I mean-- I should have--

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.669 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
me, an old spiritual
person, but I--

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>> There was a detachment.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.945 align:middle line:84%
And they just never told
me I was going to die.

00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:84%
>> But of course,
you didn't die.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.368 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it, that's--

00:09:03.368 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thankfully.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Here I am.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're glad to have you
here, but that experience

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
transformed your life
in many profound ways.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
You're here in a
wheelchair, and I see

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:90%
this arm looks pretty useless.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes it is.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.115 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:23.915 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:23.915 --> 00:09:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.425 align:middle line:84%
>> You've developed a new
relationship with yourself

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and with your body.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a friend of mine
said after the stroke,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you're more human now, which
is a fighting word to somebody

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.971 align:middle line:90%
that's being a holy man.

00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:05.460 align:middle line:10%
And-- but I did get
more into my body,

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:15.360 align:middle line:10%
more into the physical
world, but I didn't--

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:10%
but it turned out
to be spiritual.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:10%
>> For example, I became
fascinated between--

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:10%
by-- I have a spiritual
path, which is guru kripa.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%
It's the grace of the guru.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Maharaji--

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:84%
My guru had grace, and
then there was the stroke.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.505 align:middle line:90%
Grace, stroke, grace, stroke--

00:11:04.505 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Opposites.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And-- but I--

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:90%
that's pushing them together.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:10%
>> And I couldn't have imagined
that he would have let his

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:10%
grace go for me so badly.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And I kept feeling that
the stroke must have grace.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:90%
Ram Dass, we'll take a break.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.680 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.900 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Ram Dass.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
aging, change, and dying.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And just before
our break, you were

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
describing this very
poignant, powerful moment

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:84%
of trying to reconcile the fact
that one of your worst fears,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:90%
I suppose, had come true.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
You'd had a stroke, and
how do we reconcile that

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
with your deep sense of living
with the grace of your guru?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:10%
The grace of the guru, stroke.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:25.970 align:middle line:10%
Grace, stroke.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:36.310 align:middle line:10%
This was my sadhana, my
spiritual path for two weeks,

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.010 align:middle line:10%
three weeks.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:10%
How am I to--

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:10%
and that changed my
understanding of grace,

00:12:48.090 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:10%
because I learned about
grace that is terrible.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.915 align:middle line:90%
Fierce grace.

00:13:03.915 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Fierce grace, fierce grace.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that it
was real grace, but my guru--

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
he once was talking to
a girl, an Indian girl,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and she was very
sad, and she was--

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:84%
she said, Maharaji,
she said, my life

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:90%
is suffering, so much suffering.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And she was so
poignant and you know.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
he said, suffering--

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
suffering-- suffering
brings me closer to God.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Suffering brings
me close to God.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And that stroke brings
me close to God.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:44.440 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of ways it's
grace, but it introduces me,

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.570 align:middle line:90%
which--

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:84%
because of the
sickness, introduces me

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.515 align:middle line:90%
to silence, which is graceful.

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:90%


00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.605 align:middle line:90%
You hear God when you're silent.

00:15:04.605 --> 00:15:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:26.860 align:middle line:84%
The stroke-- well,
I once did a book

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:33.820 align:middle line:84%
with Paul Gorman,
"How Can I Help?"

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd say the book would
ask, how can you help me?

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm dependent,
which it's--

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
in this culture,
dependency is frowned upon.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes..

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's not power.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have been
powerful my whole life.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.358 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, like--

00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:16.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Even as a holy man, you
were a powerful holy man.

00:16:16.525 --> 00:16:18.832 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.832 --> 00:16:19.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:19.632 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And so it was grace to find
out these roles, these roles,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.900 align:middle line:90%
because I could--

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:84%
when I was a helper, I
was a powerful helper.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what most
people are that are helping.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And I think I'm helping those--

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
but when I'm helpless, we
enter into a sole friendship.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm less inclined to try
on the role of a sick person

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.420 align:middle line:90%
as I was the role of helper.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And keeping out of the
roles, then it gets to souls.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Soul to soul.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:10%
>> And to me, what goes on
between two people is heart

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.460 align:middle line:10%
resuscitation.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Souls, they're like
those planes that--

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
up in the air where
they're fueling.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:90%
And we give each other fuel.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was I do that with
all these helpers and--

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:90%


00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people probably are
living in fear that something

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.140 align:middle line:84%
like this might happen
or something else.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And the fear often keeps
us from soul awareness

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.250 align:middle line:84%
when the actual event
isn't necessarily--

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I--

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's damaging.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what I found.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That the fear of stroke
is much more damaging

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:90%
than the stroke itself.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> And-- yeah.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.600 align:middle line:84%
>> People sometimes,
I would imagine,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
feel nervous around somebody
who is disabled or handicapped

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:90%
in one way or another.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The nervousness
might interfere with

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.765 align:middle line:90%
that soul-to-soul connection.

00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:30.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:33.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The wheelchair, it's a
thing, so that-- it's

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:84%
the thing that everybody
has to deal with.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> And you begin
to see how they--

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.390 align:middle line:84%
it stands in the way of
a social interaction.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.320 align:middle line:84%
I wheeled you in here
a little earlier.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:10%
I noticed that you--
with your good arm,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:10%
you always wanted to push
it faster than I could.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, yes.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
this role has faced me with

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:84%
is having control
of my own life.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Just like you said, you were
too pushing fast and I met my--

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
everybody controls me.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And everybody does
what's best for me.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:59.067 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:12.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And I sit around feeling that
I'm losing control of my life.

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I-- before
I had the stroke,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:27.690 align:middle line:84%
I had control all the
time, which was nice.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
You were a master, I think.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.040 align:middle line:84%
All functioning adults
pretty much are, and we all--

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:37.798 align:middle line:90%
>> --face these stages.

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And this part--

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.335 align:middle line:10%
I'm learning to give up
control, which is more ego.

00:21:49.335 --> 00:21:51.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:58.350 align:middle line:10%
>> And just resting in the soul.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And I guess it means also
letting go of who you used

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, who I used to be, I
played the cello, I played golf,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:27.730 align:middle line:90%
I drove sports cars.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And traveled
all over the world.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but the reason I
used these because this is--

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Ram Dass, we're
just about out of time.
