00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.690 align:middle line:10%
Our topic today is the
mind-brain relationship.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:10%
And my guest is
Dr. Karl Pribram,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.760 align:middle line:10%
a professor of
psychology at Stanford

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.550 align:middle line:10%
University in the
Department of Psychology

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:10%
and in the medical school.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Pribram is the author
of "Languages of the Brain"

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
and hundreds of articles about
the mind-brain relationship.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I would say, fairly,
that Dr. Pribram is probably

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
one of the most influential
scholars alive today in probing

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of the
mind-brain relationship.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Karl, welcome to
the "Mind's Eye".

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, many academic
psychologists, and perhaps you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:84%
have some sympathy for
this point of view,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
over the years have taken
a perspective, which laymen

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
tend to laugh at at
times, and they claim

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.090 align:middle line:90%
that the mind doesn't exist.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you can
explain that perspective.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:10%
Talk about what we mean, or
what you mean by the mind.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't like the term
the mind because it reifies.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:84%
That means it makes a thing
of something that's a process.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:10%
We pay attention.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.910 align:middle line:10%
We see.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:10%
We hear.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Those are all mental processes--

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Activities.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.505 align:middle line:10%
>> --mental activities.

00:01:33.505 --> 00:01:35.970 align:middle line:84%
But there isn't a
thing called the mind.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
That might be something
you want to call yourself.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.470 align:middle line:84%
But the mind sort of makes
something concrete out

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of something that's
very multifaceted.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, somehow when I'm
aware of myself being aware,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that, well, that's
my mind that does that.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.175 align:middle line:90%
>> That does that.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.620 align:middle line:90%
That your mind does it.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to think
about that one.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You are very well-known in
psychology and neuropsychology

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
as the developer of the
holographic or holonomic model

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.570 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And how it relates to the mind
or to the mind-body process?

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to be on my
toes with you today.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:84%
The holonomic brain theory
is based on some insights

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
that Dennis Gabor had.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.590 align:middle line:84%
He is the inventor
of the hologram.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And he gained a Nobel Prize
for his many contributions.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.270 align:middle line:90%
He was a mathematician.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
And what he was trying
to do is develop a better

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.620 align:middle line:84%
way of making
electron micrographs,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.290 align:middle line:84%
improve the resolution
of electron micrographs.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And so for electron
microscopy, he

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.090 align:middle line:84%
suggested that instead of making
a photograph, essentially,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
not with electron
microscopes, we

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:84%
make photographs by using
electrons instead of photons.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And he thought maybe
instead of making

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
ordinary photographs,
what he would do

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:84%
is get the
interference patterns.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, what is an
interference pattern?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:84%
When light strikes, or when
electrons strike any object,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.380 align:middle line:90%
they scatter.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
But the scatter is a
funny kind of scatter.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a very
well-regulated scatter.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.370 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you
de-focus the lens on a camera

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:84%
so that you don't get the image
falling on the image plane,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and you have a blur, that blur
essentially is a hologram.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Because all you have to do is--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Refocus is.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --refocus it.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Contained in the blur
is the actual limit.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.310 align:middle line:90%
But you don't see it as such.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the main
principles of holonomic brain

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
theory, which gets us into
quantum mechanics also,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a relationship
here between what we ordinarily

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
experience and some other
process or some other order,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
which David Bohm calls the
implicate or enfolded order

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.290 align:middle line:84%
in which things are all
distributed or spread.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the
mathematical formulations

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
are often called
spread functions.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.197 align:middle line:90%
Let's spread this out.

00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what you're talking
about here is the deep

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:90%
structure of the universe--

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> --in a way, beneath the
subatomic level virtually--

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:84%
>> --of matter itself are
these quantum wave functions--

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:90%
>> --so to speak.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.102 align:middle line:84%
And they form
interference patterns.

00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Would I be wrong
in saying it would

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
be like dropping
two stones in a pond

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
with the way the
ripples overlap?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And is that like
an interference?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> That's certainly the way
interference patterns remain,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're suggesting that at
that very deep level of reality

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
something is operating
in the brain itself?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In a way, that's possible,
but that's not where

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:90%
the situation is at the moment.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
>> All we know is that the
mathematical descriptions that

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.040 align:middle line:84%
we make of, let's say, single
cell processes and the branches

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
from the single cells, and how
they interact with each other,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
not only anatomically,
but actually functional

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:90%
interactions.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That when we map those,
we get a description

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.912 align:middle line:84%
that is very similar to the
description of quantum events.

00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
>> When you take into account
that there are billions

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:90%
of these single cells--

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.907 align:middle line:90%
>> --operating in the brain.

00:05:45.907 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And the connections
between them.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:48.625 align:middle line:90%
So they're even more.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.850 align:middle line:84%
They're trillions of
connections between them.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And they operate on
the basic principles

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that have been found to also
operate at quantum level.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it was the
other way around.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:84%
That the mathematics
that Gabor used,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
he borrowed from
Heisenberg and Hilbert,

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
who developed them first in
mathematics, for Hilbert.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And then Heisenberg used
it in quantum mechanics.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:84%
And then Gabor used
in the psychophysics.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.350 align:middle line:84%
And we've used that in modeling
how brain networks work.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So in other
words, in the brain,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
when we look at the electrical
impulses traveling through

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the neurons and the patterns
as these billions of neurons

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.290 align:middle line:84%
interact, you would say that
that is analogous, I suppose,

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:84%
or isomorphic to the processes
that are going on at the deeper

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:90%
quantum level?

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know that it's a
deeper quantum level, I mean,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
in the brain.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And that may or may
not be the case.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, analogous isn't
quite the right word.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:90%
They obey the same rules.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.270 align:middle line:90%
They obey the same rules.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's not just an analogy
because the work that described

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.610 align:middle line:90%
these came independently of--

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.490 align:middle line:84%
see, an analogy would be that
you take the quantum ideas

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:14.655 align:middle line:84%
and see how they fit to
the brain, the data we

00:07:14.655 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
have on the brain.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's not
the way it happened.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:90%
We've got the brain data first.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And then we see, look, it
fits the same mathematics.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are gathering
these data, including myself,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:84%
weren't out to look for
an analogous process.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
very important point.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.477 align:middle line:84%
Because, otherwise,
you could be biased.

00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And there are lots
of different models

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that fit how the brain works.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But this is more based
on how the brain was

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
found to work independent
of these conceptions.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Independent of any model?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, essentially,
independent of any model.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've got a
mathematical structure that--

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --parallels the mathematical
structures of quantum physics.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that tell
us about the the brind?

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The brind.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>> The brind.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That might be a good
Australian way to say it,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.760 align:middle line:90%
the brind.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, what it tells me is
that the problems that have been

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.297 align:middle line:84%
faced in quantum mechanics
for, essentially, the century,

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:23.630 align:middle line:90%
well, since the '20s, late '20s.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Many paradoxes in
quantum mechanics.

00:08:25.255 --> 00:08:26.570 align:middle line:10%
>> And very many paradoxes.

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:10%
And those paradoxes also apply
at the psychophysical level

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:10%
and at the neuronal level.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we have to face
the same sets of problems.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, I
think what David Bohm

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:84%
is doing is showing that some
of the classical conceptions,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.230 align:middle line:84%
which were thought not to
apply at the quantum level,

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
really do apply at
the quantum level.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm interpreting Bohm.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not
sure he would want

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
to agree to what my
interpretation of what

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
he's doing.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But to me, that seems
to be what is going on.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So that the schism
between levels,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:84%
between the quantum level,
the sub-microscopic almost,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:90%
the subatomic level--

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> --and what goes on there--

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.758 align:middle line:90%
>> --In the classical.

00:09:13.758 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the classical,
the so-called uncertainty

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.200 align:middle line:84%
principles, and all of that,
that all applies all the way

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.000 align:middle line:90%
along.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.480 align:middle line:84%
But you've got to be very
careful in how and what--

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.590 align:middle line:90%
how should I put it?

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You've got to apply
it to the actual data

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and not just sort
of run it over.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, to the average layman--

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> --why would they
be interested in this?

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there some significance,
say, to people

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
in their everyday lives,
or in their workaday world,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:90%
in the business of life?

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure and this is the
critical thing that if, indeed,

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
we are right that these
quantum-like phenomena

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
or the rules of quantum
mechanics apply all the way

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
through to our
psychological processes,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.630 align:middle line:84%
what's going on in
the nervous system,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
then we have an
explanation, perhaps.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we have a parallel
to the kind of experiences

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that people have called
spiritual experiences.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Because the description you get
of the spiritual experiences

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.335 align:middle line:84%
seem to parallel
the descriptions

00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:26.210 align:middle line:90%
that quantum physics.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why Fritjof Capra
wrote "Tao of Physics",

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
why we have the woolly masters,
and all of this sort of thing

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.370 align:middle line:90%
that's come along.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, Bohr and Heisenberg
already, and Schrodinger.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Schrodinger talked
about the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and Bohr used of the yin
and yang as his symbols.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Because those, the
conceptions that grew out

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.160 align:middle line:84%
of watching the quantum
level, and therefore,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
now are the neurological
and psychophysical level--

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
now, there's a psychological
level as well--

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
seem to have a
great deal in common

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.960 align:middle line:90%
with our spiritual experience.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.033 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do I mean by
spiritual experience?

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:06.450 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
mental activity--

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> --calling it the mind.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
That aspect of mental
activity, which is very human,

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:84%
may be true of other species
as well, but we don't know.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
But in human endeavor,
we are always somehow,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:84%
many of us at
least, seem to need

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.110 align:middle line:84%
to get in contact
with larger issues,

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
whether they're cosmology
or some kind of biological

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
larger issue or a social one.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it's formalized in some
kind of religious activity.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:90%
But we want to belong.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is what I define
as the spiritual aspects

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.150 align:middle line:90%
of man's nature.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Some sense of relationship
to the larger cosmos,

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:90%
to the world about us.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And that part has
this implicate order.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It has the explicate order too.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, ordinary
space-time order.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to stop for a second--

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.973 align:middle line:84%
>> --because you're using Bohm's
terms of the implicate order.

00:12:04.973 --> 00:12:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't really
quite defined that.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the holographic.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
You've described it very well
with the pebbles and all that.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, OK.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a set of relationships.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the fuzzy picture.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can talk about
it in terms of waves,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
or you can talk
about it in terms

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:84%
of mathematical matrices, which
have vectors in them and so on.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:90%
You can have continuous vectors.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Or you can have
continuous matrices.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.730 align:middle line:84%
You can have all kinds of
relationships between--

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
when you look at a
photographic plate that

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:84%
has a hologram on
it, you can either

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
look at some of the
swirls in there,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
or you can look at the
individual grains of silver.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are all
kind of mathematics,

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:84%
but they all fit
together, whether it be

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Schrodinger's equation,
which is a wave equation,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:90%
or Heisenberg's more matrix.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
These are not relevant
to the ordinary person.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to say it
here because otherwise we

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
get stuck in the wave,
as if it were all waves.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's too simple.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:10%
>> But what you're saying,
if I can try and simplify it,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.530 align:middle line:10%
is that there's a level of
reality at which things are

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:10%
what they appear to be.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I look at you, and I
see a body and a face.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.640 align:middle line:90%
And then there's another level.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.625 align:middle line:84%
That would be the explicate
level, where things

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:90%
are what they appear to be.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.505 align:middle line:84%
Then there's an implicate
level, which is just is real.

00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you were
to look at it, it

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
doesn't look at all
[INTERPOSING VOICES]..

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We experience it
entirely differently.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

>> As a spiritual
aspect of our being.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Or this implicate orders
is also a potential order.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We are not in it
most of the time.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.150 align:middle line:84%
But we had, for
years, this whole idea

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:90%
of the human potential.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.998 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's
what we're talking about.

00:13:53.998 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%

be embodied somehow

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.965 align:middle line:90%

00:13:56.965 --> 00:13:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very nice, yeah.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:90%
Good way to say it.

their spiritual experiences,

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Rather than having causality.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> It's moving towards a goal.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it isn't.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, all right.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a challenge.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
It's different.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Moving toward a goal
would still be causal.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.350 align:middle line:84%
See, we don't even
have a good language

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:90%
to talk about all this.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a challenge.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
The whole system can reorganize
on the basis of this challenge.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And you never find out
where the cause is.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
We were talking
earlier-- you know,

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:90%
you said where does will start?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's a challenge.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:90%
The whole system does it.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.160 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a start
and a next and so on.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Because time and
space are enfolded.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And therefore,
there is no causality.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all just emerging.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's emerging.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And you can
challenge the system.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.397 align:middle line:84%
And it will respond in
an unpredictable way.

00:15:51.397 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I must say
I'm a little bit surprised

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:84%
because you described yourself
earlier to me as a positivist

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.960 align:middle line:90%
of sorts and a behaviorist.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, the
language that you're using

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
seems very much like the
language of the Buddhists,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:90%
who talk about--

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> --no self and just process.

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No thing.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:90%
>> No thing.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the chapters I wrote
once was a "The Nonsense of No

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Thing", in other words,
the nonsense of nothing.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's non-sensory
because senses are lenses.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And as David Bohm
has said so well,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
if you take the lenses
away, you've got a hologram.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.465 align:middle line:84%
Lenses tend to
reify, to objectify,

00:16:35.465 --> 00:16:37.570 align:middle line:90%
and particulate particles.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Take the lenses away, and
you've got this distributed.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So part of our mind-brain
process functions as a lens,

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:90%
then?

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly
the senses do.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.915 align:middle line:84%
What about the other functions
of the mind, memory, learning?

00:16:50.915 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Of what?

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Caught me again.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:90%
It's such a habit.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> What other mental functions?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Mental functions.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It's easy to say it
without reifying it.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.705 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you
want to be holistic--

00:17:01.705 --> 00:17:02.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:02.505 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --about this.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the things, in answer
to your previous question, just

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:90%
a second, if I may interrupt--

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, take your time.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:13.249 align:middle line:84%
>> --is that you said
I'm a positivist.

00:17:13.249 --> 00:17:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the hard-nosed
kind of scientist,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.319 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, of when
we were stimulus response--

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
>> --scientists, that became
very soft after a while.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And the cognitive, which was
the hardest hard-nosed kind

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:33.920 align:middle line:90%
of science--

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:84%
which was soft, became
the hard-nosed one.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite sure that the
kind of definitions I'm giving

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:84%
are just as hard as
anything that ever

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.930 align:middle line:90%
was in stimulus response cycle.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words,
at some point,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
it will become to be seen that
if you talk about spiritual

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
experiences, if you refer
to Buddhists and mystical

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.398 align:middle line:84%
concepts, that can be
taken in terms of--

00:17:55.398 --> 00:17:56.315 align:middle line:90%
>> Just as scientific.

00:17:56.315 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> --very hardcore.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's up to
scientists to do this.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't become automatic.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Very rigorous?

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.663 align:middle line:84%
Well, you don't want to get
into rigor mortis in this.

00:18:06.663 --> 00:18:11.200 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I mean you
want to be able to--

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.230 align:middle line:84%
see, the beauty of science
is that it's basically

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:90%
based on sharing.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more carefully and
clearly I can define something,

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and the reason we
want to quantify

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.490 align:middle line:84%
is not because we're
interested in quantities,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
but because then you can
communicate and share

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.200 align:middle line:84%
much more clearly than if
you can't have quantities.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So all of science is based
on the notion of sharing.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:10%
And if we can define things,
if some Buddhist tells me,

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:10%
you know, I've just
had an aha experience,

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:10%
or I've just seen
the light, and I

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:10%
don't know what the
hell he's talking about,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:10%
then I can't share that.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
But if he gets me to
have the same experience,

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:90%
that begins to be science.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And if I can make
definitions so I

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.590 align:middle line:84%
can describe to you what
is going on, let's say,

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal is secreting
some substance that

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
makes you suddenly flash
or something of that kind.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.650 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you know, then we
have some way of sharing this

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.780 align:middle line:84%
experience, which goes deeper
than when we're sort of just

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:84%
stunned by somebody saying,
yes, I've seen the light.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that may be
just metaphorical,

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
whereas it may
actually be that it

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:84%
did produce a reaction
akin to stimulation

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of the visual system,
so on, so forth.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, you're raising
many issues here.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't want to get too
off [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, but my point is
simply that this business

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of what's soft and what's
hard keeps changing.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, that's
a very important point.

00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:48.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:48.435 --> 00:19:50.030 align:middle line:10%
And my prediction
is that the kind

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:54.890 align:middle line:10%
of thing we're dealing with here
will be seen as solid and as

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.370 align:middle line:10%
scientific in the 21st century.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.178 align:middle line:84%
I'll look back at some of the
fuzzy stuff that was going

00:20:01.178 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:90%
on in the name of behaviorism.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
Many scientists,
neuroscientists, today it's

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:84%
almost axiomatic when they
talk about the mind, which

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
they sometimes do.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
They say the mind is sort
of located in the brain.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.060 align:middle line:84%
I gather that that
way of putting it

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
is totally discordant with
your own view of things.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.332 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I think--

00:20:27.332 --> 00:20:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are lots of
different ways of phrasing.

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.650 align:middle line:84%
This one is that
the mental phenomena

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:84%
are emergent properties
of how the brain works.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it's almost
like brain is secreting

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.630 align:middle line:90%
vision and mind and all that.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:84%
But maybe a better
way of talking

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
about it would be to say
that mental phenomena arise

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.870 align:middle line:84%
through the interaction
between brain

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:57.260 align:middle line:90%
and body and the environment.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And that whole
interactive, this is

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.600 align:middle line:84%
sort of what Karl Popper says,
that whole interactive thing

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:09.430 align:middle line:84%
produces an emergent, which we
call mind and spirit and so on.

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a better
way than just thinking

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.356 align:middle line:90%
of the brain secreting it.

00:21:16.356 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, how does this model
relate to human potential?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
If I want to cultivate my
various potentialities,

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.150 align:middle line:84%
my skills, reach into
the implicate order

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and make some of
it more explicate,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
do you have notions
about that for learning,

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:90%
for human development?

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you said it
yourself just now.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.360 align:middle line:84%
You reach into the
implicate order.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:90%
You allow yourself.

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Freud called it regression
in service of the ego

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to primary process
kinds of things,

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.870 align:middle line:84%
which are more holonomic,
more holographic like.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I think that's the general
way that I would say that.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:90%
This is different.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
The other is imitation.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And the kind of thing
that we have role models.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And we take care of
ourselves in terms of model

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
ourselves on
someone and the kind

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
of thing you do in sports
when you watch a videotape

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you say
creativity works the same way?

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, creativity works the
same way in the following sense

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.780 align:middle line:84%
that we allow ourselves to get,
let's just be very crude here,

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.490 align:middle line:84%
into this waveform, where
one distributed system.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And this, then, allows
the fluctuations

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
that take place there
to create new forms,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:44.200 align:middle line:84%
which, in space-time, we
can't really do too well.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, things are
already formed.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But if we get back into this
potential distributed implicate

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.090 align:middle line:84%
type of order, then
these fluctuations

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
have a chance to
reorganize as a way,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.557 align:middle line:84%
or to organize new
foci of activity.

00:23:01.557 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And these would take
the shape of mental images

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.310 align:middle line:90%
in our mind?

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time they get
to be mental images,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.730 align:middle line:84%
it's already pretty well
set into space-time form.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.520 align:middle line:84%
>> What is a mental
image in space-time?

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:84%
How would you describe
that as a neuroscientist?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've got my image
of your face right now.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I also have an
image of Brook sitting

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:84%
in a chair over
there and a big eye

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
looking at me in front, a
television eye, with my eyes

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:33.010 align:middle line:90%
closed.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's mental imagery.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You wouldn't try and tie that
to resonant neural patterns?

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, sure, I'll
be happy to do that.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.540 align:middle line:84%
There are two
kinds of mechanism.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can sort of divide
things up into twos and threes

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you divide
neural activity,

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.850 align:middle line:84%
you can divide into propagated
nerve impulses on the one hand

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and then these slow
potentials, hyperpolarizations,

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
de-polarizations that
don't go anywhere.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And they form this sort of
holographic like pattern.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's those that I feel,
and have some evidence

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:16.080 align:middle line:84%
to support this, are what
we experience as images.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Would these sort of be like
standing waves in the minds?

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Am I reaching too far here?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You said it in
the mind again.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.438 align:middle line:90%
>> The waves aren't in the mind.

00:24:26.438 --> 00:24:27.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing waves in the brain.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>> In the brain.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.790 align:middle line:84%
They could be
thought of that way.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Or as, again, I use the
matrix analogy as well,

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.390 align:middle line:84%
just so we don't get
too far into the waves.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But sure, some kind
of standing waveforms

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:90%
that are there temporarily.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it lasts longer.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
they're very brief.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And we are not
even aware of them.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.590 align:middle line:84%
But the longer they last,
Sherrington had this idea.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And he said there seems to
be a reciprocal relationship

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.830 align:middle line:90%
between reflex and mind.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.863 align:middle line:84%
The more reflex, the less
mental and vice versa.

00:25:04.863 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.620 align:middle line:84%
That relates somehow to
free will also, I gather.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there we get into a
different set of problems now.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:10%
Sure, to some extent, if you get
into your potential mode, then

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:10%
new fluctuation, new
things can happen.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.710 align:middle line:10%
But usually, free
will is conceived

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.270 align:middle line:10%
of in terms of how many
constraints are operating.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And we have in statistics a
notion of degrees of freedom.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think our
will, essentially,

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:90%
is constrained more or less.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
degrees of freedom.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.276 align:middle line:84%
And the more degrees of freedom
we have, the more we feel free.

00:25:53.276 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:90%
And we have freedom of choice.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what can we say
in wrapping the program up,

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.620 align:middle line:84%
given all of these aspects
of the mind-brain system that

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:90%
you've described?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:84%
How does that relate to, say,
the ultimate or the farther

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.570 align:middle line:90%
reaches of human potential?

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think in
the 21st century,

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be able to do an
awful lot that we weren't able

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
to do up to now, simply because
science will be admitted

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.800 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual aspects
of mankind and vice versa,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.510 align:middle line:84%
that what has been segregated
for at least 300 years since

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Galileo were the
spiritual aspects,

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.690 align:middle line:84%
in Western culture at least,
have been sort of relegated

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:90%
And people have split this.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:90%
You know, we build buildings.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:90%
We do surgery.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.760 align:middle line:90%
And do all of these things.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And then we if have a
spiritual aspect to ourselves,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.780 align:middle line:90%
we go do that somewhere else.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:51.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Separate.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas now, I think these
things will come together.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be perfectly all
right for what we today

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
call in quotes faith
healers to come and help

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:06.610 align:middle line:84%
with reduction of pain and
to ease all kinds of things.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it'll
be a different world.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't even be surprised
if preventative therapies could

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
be instituted because they deal
with controls of ourselves.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
So we aren't as
prone to get cancers.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very optimistic.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, Karl Pribram, it's been
a pleasure having you with me.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you're welcome.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It's been a pleasure
being with you too.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very
much for being with us.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:90%
