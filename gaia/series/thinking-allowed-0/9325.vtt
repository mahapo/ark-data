00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Today we are
exploring once again

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.620 align:middle line:84%
transforming our
relationship with the Earth.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.960 align:middle line:84%
My guest, Dr. Ralph
Metzner, is one

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of the pioneers of the 21st
century consciousness movement.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
He is co-author of "The
Psychedelic Experience"

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and author of many
other books, including

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.940 align:middle line:84%
"Maps of Consciousness," "The
Unfolding Self," "Ayahuasca,"

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:90%
and "Green Psychology."

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.730 align:middle line:84%
He is also president of
the Green Earth Foundation.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Ralph.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We have been talking about
the way in which we need

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:84%
to come up with an entirely
new vision of who we are

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:84%
in relationship to
our environment.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:84%
That environmentalists seemed
to have learned by now that it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
not enough to tell people
that we must take care

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of the environment, that we must
be good, that we must recycle,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that those kinds of
moralistic admonitions

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
are not going to do the job.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
in our bones

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
our connection with the Earth.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the points
that you have raised

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is that a great
deal of wisdom can

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:84%
be gathered by looking at the
esoteric cultures of humanity.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:84%
They seem to have preserved
a sense of our connection.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, the esoteric and the
Eastern and the Indigenous.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the Middle Ages,
the medieval times, in Europe

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
there existed this tradition
of alchemy, which in a way

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.790 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as being
parallel to what was called

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:90%
yoga in India and shamanism.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of alchemy,
yoga, and shamanism

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.250 align:middle line:84%
as the three major systems of
consciousness transformation.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Yoga more in the East, and
alchemy more in the West,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
and shamanism really
being the original one

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:90%
that they grew out of.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.563 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy seems to have grown out
of the shamanism of the miners

00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:84%
and the metal workers
that went into the Earth

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and extracted the
metal from the Earth.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And they had a very almost
kind of a mystical and very

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
organic psychic kind
of spiritual feeling

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:90%
for what they were doing.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, you're not referring--

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.708 align:middle line:90%
>> The miners, the metalists.

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --simply to the idea that
we can convert lead into gold.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the idea that
can be seen as a metaphor.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Psychological alchemy
would say it's a metaphor.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, there were also
the material aspect

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy, which led to
what we call chemistry.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the 15th, 16th
century, those two aspects

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
split apart, just like astrology
and astronomy split apart.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they used to be one
science, where everything

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.280 align:middle line:90%
was seen as interrelationship.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.410 align:middle line:84%
But then with the
rise of science

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of a causal
deterministic view, science

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
says, well, we don't
want to have anything

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
to do with astrology
and alchemy.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to be just
strictly scientific.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Even although the founding
fathers were not like that.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.118 align:middle line:84%
And many people don't realize
that Newton, Isaac Newton,

00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
the founding father of modern
science, was an alchemist

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
and did alchemical
studies for 20 years.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.283 align:middle line:84%
And Johannes Kepler,
who discovered

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the laws of planetary
motion was an astrologer

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
who used to set up
horoscopes for people.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I understand,
these I'll call them esoteric

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.310 align:middle line:84%
sciences, they're predicated
on the idea that the scientist

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
must transform
herself or himself.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's that we live in a
universe of interrelationships.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
It's in a way much
closer to what

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.993 align:middle line:84%
we, in postmodern thinking,
call a systems view,

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:07.910 align:middle line:90%
a living systems view.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
That the universe-- alchemists
and hermetic teachings

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
talked a lot about this
notion of correspondence.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a correspondence,
they said,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:84%
between the macrocosm
and the microcosm.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:84%
That the basic principles are
the same at all these levels

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:90%
of interrelationship.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
That's what systems theory says.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:84%
Systems theory says you look at
the world as systems existing

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
at many levels of
wholes and parts,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and what are the
common patterns?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And everything is
really a network,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:90%
a web of interconnectedness.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.120 align:middle line:90%
That's the systems view.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:84%
That's not very far from
what the hermetic teachings

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
and the mystical teachings
said, this principle

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:90%
of correspondence.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.360 align:middle line:84%
And so the alchemists
used the language.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.120 align:middle line:84%
You could say the psychological
or philosophical alchemists

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
used the language of
chemistry or metallurgy

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to describe
psychological processes.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So transformation
of lead into gold

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.910 align:middle line:84%
was the quest to transform, say,
leaden states of consciousness,

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
which would be like
depression, darkness,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
heaviness, to
listlessness, no energy,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
saturnine, melancholy, to gold
kind of consciousness, which

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:84%
would be reflective,
shining, enlightened.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.420 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like enlightenment.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
So it's symbolic.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was not either
one or the other.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.430 align:middle line:84%
It was both, just like
astrology was both.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Astrology as a system of
looking at the correspondences

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is based on accurately measuring
the positions of the planets

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
relationships between them.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
But in addition, then,
it looks at, well,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.160 align:middle line:84%
what are the harmonic
correspondences?

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.863 align:middle line:90%
Not so much causal effects.

00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Not that they're
saying that there

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
are rays coming on
the planets that

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.000 align:middle line:84%
cause you to think
in a certain way.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
But we live in this network
of interrelationships

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that are patterned and have
patterned similarities.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's very interesting to me.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I've gone, like Jung, who
was really a modern alchemist

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
and wrote several
books on alchemy

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.060 align:middle line:90%
to study that symbolism.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Carl Jung.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Carl Jung, yeah, has many
implications and applications

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
in psychotherapy because they
mapped out these processes

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness transformation.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:84%
It's all transformation
of the elements.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The elements relate to what
the psychological functions--

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.470 align:middle line:84%
earth, air, fire, and water
relate to thinking, intuition,

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:90%
feeling, and sensation.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So you when you're doing
psychotherapy or involved

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.470 align:middle line:84%
in any transformation
process, you're

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:90%
changing your way of thinking.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You're changing
the way you feel.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
You're changing the way you look
at your world, the perception.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're changing
the physical body,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:90%
so it has healing implications.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.170 align:middle line:84%
The medieval really
gifted healers,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole medical system
based on alchemy and the system

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.950 align:middle line:90%
of the humours and so forth.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And the alchemists, one
of the core principles

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.240 align:middle line:90%
was that you follow nature.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.340 align:middle line:84%
You have that
attitude of humility.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Very different.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
See, it was an
underground tradition.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.950 align:middle line:84%
It was underground in
relationship to the church too.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Because the church
felt that it wanted

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
to be the sole arbiter, the
sole source of knowledge

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and certainty and what was
valuable and what was ideal.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
It didn't really want people
to be doing transformation

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.022 align:middle line:90%
on their own.

00:07:22.022 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
tradition, meaning

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.987 align:middle line:84%
that you get in touch with
your own spirit within.

00:07:25.987 --> 00:07:27.570 align:middle line:84%
So they disguised
everything that they

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
did in this elaborate
symbolic code, which

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:84%
makes it almost
incomprehensible unless you

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.840 align:middle line:84%
take the trouble to
kind of go into it.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.292 align:middle line:84%
And so the same idea that
the shamans and the animistic

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
and [INAUDIBLE] people
have, you follow nature.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
It puts you in a humble
position, rather than

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:84%
just dominator position that
we're superior and we know best

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:84%
and we can manage, which
even some people might say,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
well, OK, we don't
want to have dominion,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
but we want to be
enlightened stewards.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So even the notion
of stewardship,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:84%
while it's suddenly better
than, say, dominating,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
still has this notion
of superiority.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And it says that,
well, we somehow

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.920 align:middle line:90%
know enough to be stewards.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.340 align:middle line:84%
>> As I say, it's
better than nothing.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's better to
be a wise steward.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so that's definitely
one thing to be encouraged.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm talking
in generalities.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There have always been
individual scientists.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There have always been
also individual Christians

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.578 align:middle line:84%
in the different traditions
who have had a completely

00:08:33.578 --> 00:08:35.344 align:middle line:90%
different attitude.

00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:38.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have, in our
culture, the notion--

00:08:38.184 --> 00:08:43.730 align:middle line:84%
well, for example, we can
exterminate insects or pests,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.530 align:middle line:90%
spiders, for examples.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous people revered
spiders and snakes

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and bats and toads--

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Creatures that we might think
of as beneath our contempt.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we think of them
as pests or vermin to be

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
exterminated.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I myself, just in the
last couple of years,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
have had a major change of
consciousness in relationship

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to insects, although I've
worked with shamanistic ideas

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and respecting animals and
animal spirits for a long time.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But I still had the
common assumption,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
unexamined assumption
in my mind that insects

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.332 align:middle line:84%
were sort of below consideration
and could be avoided.

00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
And I read this
wonderful book by a woman

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
called Joanne Lauck called
"The Voice of the Infinite

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Small," which
is about rethinking

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:90%
the human-insect consideration.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll just tell you one example.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:90%
We used to have ants.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Ants would come
in in the kitchen,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and we'd wipe them
up and take a sponge

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and just kill a couple of them.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.588 align:middle line:90%
Just wipe.

00:09:40.588 --> 00:09:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, they were a nuisance.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
They were disgusting.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
They were dirty, and
they carry diseases.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
All kind of assumptions,
but no real reason for it.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped and
thought about it.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Wait a minute, what
are these doing here?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.110 align:middle line:90%
These are ants.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:90%
They're looking for food.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.032 align:middle line:90%
Now, I can respect that.

00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're very
good at looking for food.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.657 align:middle line:84%
They're coming in
from outside the house

00:10:01.657 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and coming in
where there's food.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
they're looking for.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So I talked to them.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And I asked my wife and
the rest of my family

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.530 align:middle line:84%
also to talk to them because
it wouldn't do for one person

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to have a different attitude
and the other person

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.390 align:middle line:84%
in the family just to
kill and get rid of them.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
So I talked to them, and I
put out some food for them.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.455 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
you can have this.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I gave them a big cookie,
a piece of cookie,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and said you can have that.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.240 align:middle line:90%
And then would you please--

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:84%
I really admire you, and I like
that you are looking for food.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:90%
I can relate to that.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.430 align:middle line:90%
I can have empathy for that.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:35.513 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what we do.

00:10:35.513 --> 00:10:37.060 align:middle line:90%
We're all searching for food.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can have that
food, and then would

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:90%
you leave the kitchen, please?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So I went, and I walked away,
and two hours later they

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
were gone.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And they had
cleaned the counter.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.503 align:middle line:84%
They had actually
cleaned the counter.

00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they took all the
food and cleaned the counter.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.777 align:middle line:90%
My wife was impressed.

00:10:51.777 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
And we did it again.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:53.652 align:middle line:90%
I tried it several times.

00:10:53.652 --> 00:10:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It worked, systematically.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We've never been
bothered by ants since.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't dream
of spraying them.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a very
interesting testimony

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to the possibilities of
a whole different kind

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880 align:middle line:90%
of relationship--

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --with nature from
your personal life.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.000 align:middle line:90%
Ralph, we'll take a break now.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.864 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:11:14.864 --> 00:11:17.204 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:17.204 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
My guest, professor
Ralph Metzner,

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is talking with me about how we
can transform our relationship

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.180 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:84%
Ralph, that was a wonderful
story you told just

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
before our break
about the experience

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that you had had
developing I guess

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I would say a
shamanistic relationship

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
with the arts, a form of
communication or communion

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.300 align:middle line:90%
or community.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and a change, a radical
change for me in whereas before

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
I had just seen them as
interfering, a nuisance,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and something to get
rid of, exterminate.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And realizing, too, that there's
this whole commercial industry

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.775 align:middle line:84%
that's devoted to
exterminating various insects.

00:12:06.775 --> 00:12:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And I really
thought it's amazing

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.877 align:middle line:84%
how insane that is, really,
and how completely unjustified.

00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And how we hurt
ourselves in the process.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And how we hurt ourselves.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Insects play a vital role in
the ecology of everything.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They are the great decomposers
and the pollinators.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And many insects in
shamanic cultures

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:28.910 align:middle line:84%
have a major role to play
in terms of bees, spiders,

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.320 align:middle line:90%
butterflies, and all of these.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.840 align:middle line:84%
With flies too,
common houseflies,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.865 align:middle line:90%
I used to kill them.

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm ashamed to
say I subsequently

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.940 align:middle line:84%
learned to apologize to the lord
of the Flies, you might say,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.570 align:middle line:90%
the deity of the flies.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I would go to bed, and then if
there was a fly buzzing around,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say, oh, I
can't go to sleep.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
This insane buzzing, it's
just driving me nuts.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go get my fly swatter
and try to hunt it down

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:90%
and kill it.

00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And I had this change
of heart, really.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.305 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, wait a
minute, that's inappropriate.

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:05.180 align:middle line:90%
Why should I do that?

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.790 align:middle line:84%
The fly has just as much
right to be here as I do.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't own this.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.120 align:middle line:90%
This is just airspace.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So I just stopped
seeing it that way.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:90%
I stopped seeing it as annoying.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I just saw it as my friend.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And you know what happened is
I haven't heard them since.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:90%
They haven't been around.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.060 align:middle line:90%
They just have not come.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>> They're willing to respond
to your change in consciousness.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even ask them
to leave me alone.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
I just said, OK,
interesting fly.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:90%
And so they've come and gone.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
I just haven't
even noticed them.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:39.390 align:middle line:84%
But that's what
really amazed me.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.110 align:middle line:84%
>> What you're saying, I think,
is far more profound than

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
people might
appreciate at first.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so easy to
be caught in that world

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
where we find pests
pesty, and we're

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:90%
going to get rid of the pests.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And in so doing, we pollute
the water and the air,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
and we create all sorts
of environmental toxins.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And we see in nature,
it's part of this whole thing

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
of seeing nature as
being threatening.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So so much of our
industry and technology

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.930 align:middle line:84%
has evolved to protect
us from nature.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I learned that one
also when I went

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
on a vision quest in the
desert for the first time

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:90%
when I was 50.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
When I turned 50, I went
on a four-day vision quest

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.885 align:middle line:90%
where you fast just with water.

00:14:22.885 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
You have a protective system
so you don't get lost,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:90%
and you're not hiking around.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But you're there, and you have
nothing to do except tune in.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:84%
No television, no reading,
nothing to distract you.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.865 align:middle line:84%
And I you spend a lot of
time watching the weather

00:14:40.865 --> 00:14:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and thinking, oh, where
are the clouds coming from?

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Where's the wind coming from?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.815 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what the
temperature is going to be,

00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and all of that kind of thing.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And taking precautions--
building a shelter,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.510 align:middle line:90%
building a fire.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was impressed by
the fact, how much we're

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.978 align:middle line:90%
insulated ourselves.

00:14:56.978 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We live in these houses where
everything is controlled.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.855 align:middle line:84%
Temperature is controlled--
not too hot, not too cool.

00:15:01.855 --> 00:15:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're watching the
weather reports all the time

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly so
we won't be minimally

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
disturbed in our little
hermetically sealed

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and isolated, really shut off
from the [INAUDIBLE] and all

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
these super structures and
systems to predict and control

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and isolate us so we
have minimum discomfort

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and minimum inconvenience.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the cost of really
shutting off our perception

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:90%
and not observing.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And the ever-changing patterns
of nature can be observed.

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So being alone on a vision
quest in the wilderness

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
is an ancient tradition
of native North American

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Indians and other societies,
where you're just out there

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
alone by yourself, and
you pray for a vision,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
which is a vision meaning a
sort of guidance for your life.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.010 align:middle line:84%
What am I supposed
to do with my life?

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Where am I going?

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What's my role in life?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the person
who is on a vision

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
quest will connect with
spirits of animals,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.980 align:middle line:84%
and then they might
become a healer,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:84%
or they might become an artist,
or whatever their role may be.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And people have done
this traditionally

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:84%
at certain key transition
points in their life,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
particularly adolescence, in
the kind of rite of passage

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
for helping a young person move
out of the matrix of the family

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:84%
into a larger matrix of
society and define themselves

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.810 align:middle line:84%
as a member of that
tribe or society

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and find their position
and their role.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But now people are
doing the vision quests

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:90%
at any kind of transition--

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
work, midlife transition,
work transition,

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.300 align:middle line:84%
relationship transitions, or
crisis, that kind of thing,

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:90%
finding themselves in a new way.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
It can be done
outside in nature,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
or it can be done-- some
do it through meditation.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.270 align:middle line:84%
Some do it through visionary
substances or plants,

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.030 align:middle line:84%
shamanic practices
of various kinds.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it just comes.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
But the role of intention
is always really critical.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.589 align:middle line:84%
A vision for one's life is
unlikely to come if you're just

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:10.500 align:middle line:84%
going along and just living
life the way that we usually do.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to actually want it.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
You have to intend
it so that you

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
would look in that direction.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, fundamentally you
seem to be talking about

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:84%
an awakening to the realization
that all of nature is alive,

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
and I would even say conscious.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> All of nature is alive.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And, see, the Gaia
theory says that--

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
invented by two scientists,
Jim Lovelock and Lynn Margulis,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
says that the whole
planet is really alive,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:90%
not just the biosphere.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Normally science says,
well, there's the biosphere.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.352 align:middle line:84%
There's sort of this film of
life over this inanimate rock,

00:17:53.352 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you have the
biosphere, and then

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
you have the atmosphere, in
front of the environment.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And the Gaia theory says, no.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
The whole thing together-- the
rocks, the oceans, the life,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
and the atmosphere--
is all one system.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I've interviewed scientists
who would maintain that even

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.500 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum of space is
alive and conscious.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be a
further extension of that.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:26.880 align:middle line:84%
So Lovelock said the atmosphere
is part of the organism of Gaia

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:90%
just like the shell of a snail.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, very
analogous to the shell

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:90%
of a snail is produced by the--

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
the atmosphere is
actually produced by life.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.340 align:middle line:84%
It's an outgassing of
life, organic life.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why you don't have
an atmosphere in outer space,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.310 align:middle line:90%
only around the planet.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's maintained by life
just in the right conditions

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.700 align:middle line:84%
and temperature and
chemical composition

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
to be favorable
for even more life.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.485 align:middle line:84%
So that's what makes
this health maintaining.

00:18:54.485 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Whether or not
it's conscious,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:84%
it seems to be quite
intelligent, you might say.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's right.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:84%
From a scientific
point of view, they

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
won't say it's conscious because
consciousness is not a concept

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.722 align:middle line:90%
that scientists can work with.

00:19:03.722 --> 00:19:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll have
to change that.

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:84%
But Indigenous people,
Indians and people

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
with a historical interest
in goddess cultures

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
of ancient times say,
oh, this is great.

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:90%
This is Gaia, the goddess.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the scientists,
like Lynn Margulis,

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, actually
get quite upset.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.245 align:middle line:90%
They don't like that.

00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They think it's a
misappropriation.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:90%
But they would go further.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only is the planet
alive, they would say,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:90%
but also there is consciousness.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And because there's
consciousness

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
in everything, consciousness
in rocks and trees

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and rivers and mountains and
animals and humans, of course,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.563 align:middle line:84%
and therefore the
Earth as a whole.

00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have the parts
be conscious and not the whole

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:90%
be conscious.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Which is why it's
possible to communicate.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
That was Earth Mother, Mother
Earth, the oldest divinity

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, seen as being--

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.550 align:middle line:84%
so conscious meaning that you
could communicate with her,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and really a deity
or a divinity meaning

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.850 align:middle line:84%
that there is reverence to
this being, which would put you

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:09.060 align:middle line:84%
in a position of
reverence, and it

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
would lead to a much more
responsible and environmentally

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
ethical, morally, position if
you see the Earth as a mother.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.163 align:middle line:90%
It's not guaranteed.

00:20:22.163 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
You still have to work out
the details of how you're

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.060 align:middle line:84%
going to-- but the starting
attitude would be much more

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.120 align:middle line:90%
positive.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
ecological advantage

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:90%
of having such a view.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
traditional view.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Not only the Earth is
alive, but all the planets

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:90%
are the bodies of gods.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
We even gave them
the names of gods.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Mars, Venus, Mercury,
Jupiter, Saturn,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.080 align:middle line:84%
they're all the
names of deities.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me that in many
Indigenous cultures and even

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
some more recent cultures,
psychoactive substances play

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:84%
an important role in
reinforcing these key insights.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, that was
a revelation for me

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:84%
too because I came out
of psychedelic research

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s, where we
were basically at Harvard

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and subsequently
looking for ways,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.400 align:middle line:84%
trying to find ways that
psychedelic drugs could be used

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to enhance awareness
for therapy,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
for creative problem
solving, for healing,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual experiences.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And we did research in
various kinds of applications.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Then I gradually became
aware that there are shamanic

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
traditions going back
thousands of years--

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.710 align:middle line:90%
nobody even knows how far--

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of various plants and
mushrooms used in sacred ritual

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
form as an adjunct to shamanic
healing and divination.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.295 align:middle line:84%
And I became much more
interested in those.

00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And of course
there was a revival

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.850 align:middle line:84%
of interest in the
sacred mushroom of Mexico

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:90%
and all of these things.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And so there, then
you're dealing

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
with people that use these
substances, some of which

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.780 align:middle line:84%
maybe are chemically very
similar to the drugs coming out

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.602 align:middle line:84%
of the laboratories of
the modern scientists,

00:22:00.602 --> 00:22:02.310 align:middle line:84%
using the same
substances, but using them

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
in a completely different way,
with a completely different

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.330 align:middle line:90%
world view.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, take something like
ayahuasca, which is this brew.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
It's made out of
several different plants

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
used in South America for
healing and divination.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So talk about a difference
in medical model.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.660 align:middle line:84%
If we're sick, we
go to the doctor.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
Doctor gives you a medicine
and says, take the pill,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%
and hopefully you get better.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:90%
So there, you're sick.

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:90%
You go to the shamanic healer.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.490 align:middle line:90%
And he takes the brew, or she.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:90%
She takes the medicine.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:38.400 align:middle line:84%
The healer drinks the
medicine for seeing

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and for communicating with their
healing spirits, which he's

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:84%
learned to be in touch with
through their training,

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.940 align:middle line:84%
through their equivalent of
medical school, apprenticeship

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.990 align:middle line:90%
with other shamans.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.820 align:middle line:84%
And starts to sing songs, which
invoke healing spirits, which

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.230 align:middle line:90%
do the healing on the patient.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Ralph, we're out of time.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much for sharing
your passion with me.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being with us.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:90%
