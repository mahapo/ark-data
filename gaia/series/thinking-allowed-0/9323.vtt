00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mislove.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to
explore the journey of Christ.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.530 align:middle line:84%
With me is Dr. Jean
Houston, internationally

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
renowned speaker, teacher,
and leader of leaders.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:84%
She is the author
of numerous books,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:84%
including Search for the
Beloved, The Possible Human,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:90%
and Godseed.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.543 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jean.

00:00:53.543 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.752 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be with you again.

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not
a Christian person.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.690 align:middle line:90%
I was raised Jewish.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say,
looking out at the world,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.110 align:middle line:84%
one can't help but be
astounded at the impact

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.030 align:middle line:84%
that the myth or the story or
the history, the life of Christ

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.850 align:middle line:90%
has had on the human race.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there's a
very good reason for this.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's as if
in the life of Jesus,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
he recapitulates
the entire history,

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:90%
the entire saga of humankind.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Here he is, born the
miraculous child.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that
refers to the fact

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that we are all there in
an immaculate condition.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
We have an open
road of potential.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything is possible.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And then he has his ministry,
in which he does the impossible.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:84%
He explores all manner
of ways of being.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:90%
He accepts everybody, you know.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
A modern corporate
advisor would never

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.570 align:middle line:84%
be able to bring
in people the way

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.070 align:middle line:84%
he did-- hey, you in the
brothel, come on, come join me.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Hey, you, the fisherman,
come, come, you know?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
This agreement to bring
in the entire spectrum

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%
of the human race.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.479 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there is a book out
called Jesus Christ, CEO.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> CEO, yeah.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.210 align:middle line:90%
He does miracles.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And miracles are
merely more modes

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of understanding our reality
than we normally see, you know?

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
He undergoes tremendous
suffering, and then upsy daisy,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:90%
you know, he's back again.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's true of many of us.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have really
died many times in our life,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.350 align:middle line:84%
through depression,
through illness,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.960 align:middle line:84%
through just going
taking the wrong path

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and then to come back?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's as if it
is a recapitulation

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
of the entire possibility
of the human species.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And sort of an
expression, I gather,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.272 align:middle line:84%
of the great myths
of all of humanity,

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.230 align:middle line:90%
death and resurrection.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Death and resurrection,
you find in--

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
well, a great
percentage of the myths,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.340 align:middle line:84%
that we die to our
local condition and we

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
are reborn to a higher
condition in ourselves.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I were to ask
you how often in your life

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
if you died and been reborn
in one way or another--

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.235 align:middle line:90%
>> A couple of times.

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And we live in a world where
there seems to be, however,

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.600 align:middle line:84%
a lot of tension
amongst Christians,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.820 align:middle line:84%
people such as yourself who
are visionary, global people.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
fundamentalists who say, no, we

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
must look at this story
in its most literal sense.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think they leave--

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:90%
they lose a great deal.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Because the story
is like a coded--

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:90%
it's a code.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like a seed crystal in
a super saturated solution.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you put the
story, it opens you up.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It opens you up to
the human drama.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look at
Christ's message,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
where he says the
kingdom is within you,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
the kingdom, the depths.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:84%
It means that we
contain such a treasure

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
house of creative
possibilities, of potentials,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:84%
of skills, of the ability
to access and to enter

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
into beingness with God.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
He says, the things
I do, you shall

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.310 align:middle line:84%
do but you shall
do better, in John.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.438 align:middle line:90%
He calls us into our greatness.

00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:05.980 align:middle line:84%
>> As if he is a template for
what the human race can become.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, wonderful.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Yes, he is a pattern of
possibility, the higher man,

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
he does, perhaps

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
as much as any spiritual
leader in history,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.000 align:middle line:84%
is he really calls forth the
possible human, what we can be.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Look at his deep sensory
appreciation of nature.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.360 align:middle line:84%
He's always talking about mint
and cumin and tasty things,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
and he goes to one
party after another.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.925 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if that
number of parties

00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:33.550 align:middle line:84%
got screened through
the New Testament,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine what the
reality probably was, you know?

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.860 align:middle line:84%
You look at
psychologically, the way

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.950 align:middle line:84%
he relates with
such leaky margins,

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
with such empathy to
everyone he meets,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.150 align:middle line:84%
his deep appreciation
of children,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
his calling forth of children,
the little child shall lead us.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.063 align:middle line:84%
And yet, his ability
to suffer so deeply

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:53.230 align:middle line:90%
in the garden of Gethsemane.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.480 align:middle line:84%
He didn't want what
was about to come,

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
let this cup pass-- how
often we have said that?

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the very fact
that his life has moved

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
into mystery and into myth.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, there were many
people in Palestine, Israel

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:84%
at that time, who were
looking for the Messiah.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And some claimed
to be the Messiah.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And what was unique
about him is here

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you had the great tale of the
mystery, the dying and rising

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
God, which of course, was
one of the great stories

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and celebrations in
the ancient world.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But here you had a person
who actually did it.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is the nature
of the cross, you know?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Here's a Jewish
political tragedy,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and here is the great mystery
of death and Resurrection.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So a human being incorporated in
space and time and form touches

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.130 align:middle line:84%
into the depths
of human capacity

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and knows that I and
my Father are one,

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that we are all children
of God, that we are all--

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
we are all part of
the divine parentage.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting from
a cross-cultural perspective.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.610 align:middle line:84%
In the Asian religions, there
are many religious teachers

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
who say, you know,
atman is Brahmin.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.252 align:middle line:84%
I am one with the
infinite, with the eternal.

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And they say, well,
very good for you.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:90%
You finally realized it.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:90%
It's about time.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And here we say, kill the idiot.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Because we have this sense,
especially in the West,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of being disconnected from
the source of our being.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And what you find in
Yeshua ben Yusuf--

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
he never heard
Jesus of Nazareth.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:90%
He heard--

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a Greek name.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, Jesus would be.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But Yeshua, or
Joshua ben Yusuf--

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>> He didn't speak Greek.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> He-- well, no.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:90%
You remember, he was a Galilean.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Galilei, in the circle of
gentiles, that's what it means.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And he lived in a
tremendous crossroads.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So he would
have known Greeks,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.475 align:middle line:84%
probably spoke some
Greek, certainly Roman,

00:06:37.475 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:90%
certainly Latin.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Aramaic.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Hebrew, Aramaic.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:90%
So he was a rabbi.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:90%
He was a very cultured man.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think judging
by a lot of things

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
that were said
about him, that he

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
had a very fine knowledge of the
ancient world as it was then.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:90%
This was not a local yokel.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Over 2,000 years,
each generation,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
each age and many different
organized bodies of religion

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.560 align:middle line:90%
have interpreted his life--

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And have reinvented him.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
He's really the man for all
seasons and for all eras,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.303 align:middle line:84%
Right now, there's
a tremendous spread

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity
all over the world.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's just because
of the essential hope that he

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
offers, the whole sense that
you are much larger than you

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.147 align:middle line:90%
think you are.

00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:25.480 align:middle line:90%
You are a child of the universe.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
You are a member
of a universe that

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:84%
is larger than your aspiration,
more complex than all

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:90%
your dreams.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:84%
You have access to the
orchestration of realities.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
You can make things grow.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.550 align:middle line:90%
You can heal.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.070 align:middle line:90%
And he keeps saying, you can.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Don't just look at
me, look at what

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I am reflecting what you are
and what you can be and do.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a funny
sense in which as you speak

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:84%
for the meaning of this
extraordinary life,

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.510 align:middle line:84%
some people have said, in fact,
that your teachings are not

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:90%
very Christian.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think as I
recall, you've responded

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
by saying, well, Jesus might not
have been a Christian himself.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.695 align:middle line:84%
>> No, he would have
probably had a bad time.

00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But I have a kind of
a joke about this.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.910 align:middle line:84%
I say if Jesus and Buddha
and Moses were to come back,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Moses would be
leading desert tours,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Buddha would have been at
Esalen, or one of the growth

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.267 align:middle line:84%
seminars, and Jesus would have
been on all the talk shows.

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And yet, of course, they all had
their problems in their time,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
didn't they?

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but that statement
seems to speak more for our own

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.930 align:middle line:84%
age, an age in which things
become somehow trivialized

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.627 align:middle line:90%
by mass culture.

00:08:34.627 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, mass culture does that.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
about mass culture

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
is that it is able to
celebrate these great lives.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many lives
of Jesus have you seen?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is always a
shock of recognition,

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.220 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how tawdry
might be the production.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a great sense
of humor talking about it,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
but I know in your undertaking
to write this book of the life

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:84%
of Christ, Godseed, that this
was something that came from

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.320 align:middle line:90%
your own depths.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It came from my own
ambivalence about the story.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.065 align:middle line:84%
My father was an
agnostic Baptist.

00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.190 align:middle line:90%
He didn't believe anything.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And my mother was a
Sicilian Catholic.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And so I went to Catholic
school the first year.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at Jesus
up there on the cross,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.320 align:middle line:84%
and I heard the
priest saying how

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was going to do nasty
things to us and hell.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said to my Sicilian
grandmother, nonna,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.787 align:middle line:84%
is that our Jesus
he's talking about?

00:09:27.787 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
She says, no,
[SPEAKING ITALIAN],, she said,

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.420 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.680 align:middle line:90%
That's just Jesu of the priest.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:84%
You and me, we know the
real Jesu, you know?

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And so who is this
being who has evoked

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.968 align:middle line:84%
such response to hundreds
of millions of people?

00:09:41.968 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's why I wrote Godseed.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote it in such a
way that people could follow

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:90%
the story and be part of it.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
As in many of my books,
we have exercises.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So I literally take you into
being reborn as the holy child.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I take you into exercises
when you really learn

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to do deep m deep recognition.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I studied the way
Jesus did his miracles.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And I found that in the
miraculous, what he did

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.920 align:middle line:84%
is he would first
look at a person

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
with such love and such
wonder and astonishment.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:90%
So that was already a shock.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
That was an altered
state, you know?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And then he would say
things like, your sins,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.390 align:middle line:84%
your unskilled
behavior is forgiven.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.810 align:middle line:90%
You're released.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And then he would
touch them, or he

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:84%
would provide this
what we consider

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:90%
vitalizing life energy.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And he would see them in
their optimal template,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.010 align:middle line:90%
their optimal possibility.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And then it was as
if the Godseed in him

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:84%
would recognize the
Godseed in others.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then the
whole system, the whole body,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
mind, being was
transfigured, was

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:84%
changed because he
could hold, in the way

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that the ordinary
person couldn't, he

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.747 align:middle line:84%
could hold the
optimal possibility.

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Because he lived in the kingdom.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.695 align:middle line:90%
So the kingdom is in the midst.

00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
In one of the Gnostic
Gospels, he said,

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.055 align:middle line:84%
if you look for the
kingdom up there,

00:10:55.055 --> 00:10:56.680 align:middle line:84%
the birds will get
there before you do.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
If you look for the
kingdom down in the sea,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.562 align:middle line:90%
the fish are going to be there.

00:10:59.562 --> 00:11:01.150 align:middle line:90%
The kingdom is right here.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
It is in the midst.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.750 align:middle line:90%
It's within you.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:90%
It's without you.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Living in the kingdom means
in your terms, Jeffrey,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.460 align:middle line:84%
it's probably living
in the larger hologram,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:84%
living in the
quantum reality where

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.480 align:middle line:84%
everything is available
at every different moment.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.276 align:middle line:90%


00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:21.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Jean, we're talking
about the life

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus and the
relationship that we

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
might be able to form with a
Christlike spirit within us.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know many
Christian churches also

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.880 align:middle line:84%
talk about that relationship,
but they put it often,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.710 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me,
it's put like this,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that they refer to a
statement where Jesus says,

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.420 align:middle line:84%
no one can come to the
father but through me.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm the only way.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and of course, there's
always interpretations of it.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's the I am.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.940 align:middle line:90%
The I am is the God sense.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is that you come to
the Father through the--

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.883 align:middle line:84%
you come to God
through that God self.

00:12:06.883 --> 00:12:07.683 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.683 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Meister Eckhart, one of
the great Christian mystics

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
of the 14th century, said,
as nuts seeds bring forth

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.300 align:middle line:84%
nut trees and pear seeds
bring forth pear seeds,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
so as pear seeds
bring forth pears,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.140 align:middle line:84%
nut seeds bring forth nuts, so
god seeds bring forth the gods.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And that we are god-seeded
in each one of us.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's been
the Jesus seminars.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
There's been so much work
done on what did he say,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:90%
what did he really say.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.075 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I think
they tend to throw out

00:12:35.075 --> 00:12:37.980 align:middle line:84%
the baby with the
bathwater in some of this.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we do know,
is that we have

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.630 align:middle line:84%
a person who came to a
sense, an absolute sense

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
of his own identity
with God, with being

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.510 align:middle line:84%
with the mind, something
that we all can do.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And then he out of
the intensity of this

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and his extraordinary capacity
for loving, for deep empathy,

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:84%
it was that loving
empathy that allowed

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.730 align:middle line:84%
him to call forth the greatness
and the genius in others.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a sense in
which your work would stand

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition of
the gnostics, who.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Who were attacked by
the early church fathers.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Irenaeus,
particularly, yes.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, in so far
as that we believe,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and the gnostics also
tended to believe,

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
that the kingdom is within.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And many of the Gospels
were Gnostic Gospels.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:29.630 align:middle line:84%
The final four that came down
are just one of probably many.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, when
in 1945, that Nag Hammadi

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:33.750 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So many more different
papyruses and different --

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, many of
these apocryphal.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Apocryphal, and others.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Books are now
available to us.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right,
they are available.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:90%
So we do have a larger sense.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And we see a Jesus who
is whimsical, sometimes

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
cranky, has a great
sense of humor,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.570 align:middle line:84%
a powerful sense of paradox,
and a very, very rich mind.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, influential
in his own day

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:90%
to have spawned so many books.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, within the
200-year period.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think a very
important thing is his sense

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
of the miraculous.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.230 align:middle line:84%
That we are not limited to a
certain bandwidth of reality.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Enter into it a
sense of the kingdom,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
work out of love and
compassion, and of deep seeing.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:90%
And the band expands.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And so much more
becomes possible.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Much of your work has
involved study of the latest

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.125 align:middle line:90%
developments in cosmology.

00:14:31.125 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Cosmology physics.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Quantum physics and science.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Biology.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Where it seems as if science
need not be opposed to these

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
ideas of religious miracles,
but may actually provide a new

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:84%
foundation for
reinterpreting them.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, expand consciousness
along its bandwidth.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Get out of the limited
half asleep state

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
we call normal waking
consciousness and reality

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
expands.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.320 align:middle line:84%
We become part of what Bohm
called the implicate explicate

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:90%
We become part of.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>> This is David Bohm.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:90%
>> David Bohm.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We become part of this
universe in which we

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
have, as self-conscious members,
we have a much larger part

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:90%
to play.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And what these religious
geniuses like Jesus, Buddha,

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so many that we
could name, what they did is,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
they tapped into this immensity.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And they then saw
our local reality

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.255 align:middle line:84%
as glorious and
beautiful and filled

00:15:25.255 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:84%
with the passion
for the possible

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:90%
that normal people didn't see.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I think what we're
living in a time, where

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
survive our time

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and deal with
present complexity,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.350 align:middle line:84%
the extraordinary has
to become ordinary.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a sense that
the traditionalists are saying,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
in these frightening times,
we have to return to Jesus,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.617 align:middle line:90%
to traditional values.

00:15:45.617 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
There is a sense in which you're
saying something very similar

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the
return is, of course,

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
it's a different interpretation
of what Jesus is saying.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It isn't Jesus
as totally other.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:02.385 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus as serving as a
template for our own becoming.

00:16:02.385 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> To access our own.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> To access.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Inner greatness.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 15th century, the
favorite book of the time was

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.400 align:middle line:84%
called "The
Imitation of Christ."

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> By Thomas a Kempis.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And there were many
variations of that.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:90%
And people actively sought.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.755 align:middle line:84%
>> Unfortunately, too often
in the medieval, like,

00:16:18.755 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
high Middle Ages, what
they sought was to emulate

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:90%
the suffering.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.267 align:middle line:90%
And not the.

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> They would scorch themselves.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Capacity.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
They would scorch, not
the capacity for loving.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But that idea of the
imitation of Christ is.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The imitation
of, that we all.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> You seem to be suggesting
we're not talking about a cheap

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:37.440 align:middle line:90%
imitation here.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that we're talking
about a profound identity.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I have known a number
of people in my life

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
who have been deeply identified
with a Christian sensibility

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:90%
influence.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And it is amazing how
their minds have soared.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.558 align:middle line:84%
How their spirits
were so rich and deep.

00:16:55.558 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:90%
How deep they could love.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.058 align:middle line:84%
One of them was a man I called
Mr. Teilhard, who turned out

00:16:59.058 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
to be Teilhard de Chardin.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:90%
>> He's a great theologian.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Very.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And a great paleontologist.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.560 align:middle line:90%
And.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Who was, incidentally,
silenced by the church.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Was silenced by the church.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.220 align:middle line:90%
But still, he got his work out.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And it has had a profound
effect on theologians

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:90%
and scientists alike.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's somebody who
certainly also emulated

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.950 align:middle line:90%
that Christ spirit.

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:24.089 align:middle line:84%
>> And there seems to be a
need for that in our time.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> We have a need for greatness.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
We live in a time
in which we can

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.610 align:middle line:84%
no longer live as half
asleep versions of ourselves.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic Gospels, Jesus
said, I came into this world

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:90%
because you were all drunk.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:36.800 align:middle line:90%
You were all asleep.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.553 align:middle line:90%
I came to wake you up.

00:17:38.553 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Not unlike the Buddha.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:84%
When they said to the Buddha,
sir, what exactly are you?

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Are you a god?

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.643 align:middle line:90%
Certainly not a god.

00:17:44.643 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Are you an angel then?

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not an angel.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
What are you?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm just awake,
said the Buddha.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, Christ said something
very, very, very similar.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
That when we wake
up, and all of us

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
have had moments of
waking up, if even

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the drowse
of our days we go to sleep,

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.180 align:middle line:84%
we can still remember
that time of waking up.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Where suddenly, I
mean sensorally,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
everything took on this
brilliance, this energy,

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:90%
this vitality, this glory.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Psychologically it was as if we
no longer had the psychic skin.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We had this deep
empathy with people.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Mystically, we saw our lives
as part of a much larger story.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And spiritually,
we knew ourselves

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.350 align:middle line:90%
as God's seeds incarnate.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it's like.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary
experience.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
I think there is a return to the
mystic path in our time really.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Mysticism is the art
of union with reality.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's, of course,
what Jesus did.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And the mystic is one who really
realizes that that union is not

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
only possible, it's necessary.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.080 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to deal
with the immense complexities

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of our time if we are
not also god-seeded,

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
god-partnered, and
are in a sense,

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
we are the partner of
this larger process.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.508 align:middle line:90%
We are agents of the process.

00:18:58.508 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at the mystic path,

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
it really is very close to
Jesus' path as we see it.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And I try to show
that in my book.

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.340 align:middle line:90%
That you wake up.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
That there is that
statement, aha.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes!

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And then there is that
sense often of uh oh,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I've got to do
something about it.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
I've got to cleanse myself.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.165 align:middle line:84%
So we have the story
of Jesus wakening.

00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a
story of his going

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.490 align:middle line:84%
into the desert
to cleanse himself

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.850 align:middle line:84%
of old habits, old
traditions, old expectations.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The devil, you know,
is a projection

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.900 align:middle line:84%
says, I'll give you the
cities of the world,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:84%
get thee behind me, Satan, my
kingdom is of another order.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's the release.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And then followed
by the ministry,

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
which is the state of
illumination, of visionary

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.018 align:middle line:90%
seeing of the miraculous.

00:19:44.018 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
This is also part
of the mystic path.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing good in the world.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing good in the world.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:53.598 align:middle line:84%
And great happiness, all those
parties, great celebration.

00:19:53.598 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, what
goes up must come down,

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.307 align:middle line:84%
and you have the dark
night of the soul.

00:19:57.307 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, of course, the
story and gets him and he--

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the crucifixion.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the final stage
is unification, union.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And there's.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Resurrection.

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's true of many of our
lives, of all of our lives.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There seems to be a
paradox in this life.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:17.090 align:middle line:84%
That he who was crucified, who
met so much opposition, who

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:84%
was an outsider of
the established order

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.560 align:middle line:84%
has now become in many ways,
the symbol of mainstream

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.690 align:middle line:84%
established
religious traditions.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I think he'd be
quite astonished.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.602 align:middle line:84%
I often thought
that if Jesus could

00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:32.060 align:middle line:84%
see what was done
in his name, he'd

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:84%
have gone back into
the carpenter's shop

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and would not have come out.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:90%
But that's probably not true.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Yes, things begin in, in
so many different things.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.850 align:middle line:90%
You have the primary revelation.

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.918 align:middle line:84%
You have the one who has
the fullness of spirit.

00:20:50.918 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the second
and third and fourth generation,

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:90%
and there's a diminution.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.190 align:middle line:90%
And then an occasional genius.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's true of anything and
anybody and any institution.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> The things get crystallized.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:84%
>> They get crystallized,
they get encapsulated,

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:90%
they get stuck.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And people settle for mediocrity
and not the radical demand.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
The problem with Jesus
is his radical demand.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.920 align:middle line:84%
>> These things I
do, you shall do,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.880 align:middle line:84%
you are a son and daughter of
God, and better live as such.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So even as sort of a
mainstream religious icon,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.377 align:middle line:84%
he's calling people to
something revolutionary.

00:21:26.377 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And evolutionary.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.410 align:middle line:90%
Not simply revolutionary.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:35.310 align:middle line:84%
He's calling us to the unfolding
of our primary condition, which

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
is stewards of revolution,
stewards of the taking

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.390 align:middle line:90%
care of the planet.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what would happen
to this planet, Jeffrey,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.110 align:middle line:90%
if we all became Christic?

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:84%
How would we then
be able to see?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean he who looked
so closely at nature

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:84%
and used all these natural
images, consider the birds,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:84%
consider the lilies, neither
do they, they don't sow,

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
they don't reap, and yet
Solomon all his glory

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and array as these, they
just hang out and are happy.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.210 align:middle line:90%
What would it be like?

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:84%
How would we take the
Christic attitude, that deep

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.742 align:middle line:90%
compassionate caring, evoke it?

00:22:08.742 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like
we might be less.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.283 align:middle line:90%
>> We'd be very different.

00:22:11.283 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Concerned with our material
welfare and more concerned with

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.645 align:middle line:90%
healing the planet.

00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The treasures in heaven, the
treasures in the depths of what

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:90%
we are.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And from the depths
of what, I've

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:84%
spent a lifetime looking
at the treasures within.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And I assure you, if we began
to use just a tiny percentage

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
of the capacities that we have
and the knowledge that all

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
of us have, this would be
a very different planet

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160 align:middle line:90%
within 20 years.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And we have that possibility.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We certainly
do, and we have to.

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:90%
We've run out of time.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.630 align:middle line:90%
We have to use it.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to become what we
are, the possible human who

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.580 align:middle line:90%
creates the possible society.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Jean Houston, we
have run out of time.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.320 align:middle line:84%
But it's such a
joy to be with you

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and to have this sense of our
own inner greatness reawakened

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.895 align:middle line:90%
through this conversation.

00:22:54.895 --> 00:22:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Jean, thanks so much
for being with me.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you,
Jeffrey, thank you.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a pleasure.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for being with us.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.090 align:middle line:90%
