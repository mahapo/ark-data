>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to
explore intuitive healing.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr. Judith Orloff,
author of "Second Sight"

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
and also "Dr. Judith Orloff's
Guide to Intuitive Healing."

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:90%
Judith is a psychiatrist.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Judith.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh hi, Jeffrey.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you again.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Same here.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You describe intuition as
an incredible source of wisdom.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course you're a
professional intuitive.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:90%
You've been trained.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:84%
You've worked in a university
setting in this regard.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying is
that this source of wisdom

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:90%
is available to everybody.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it is.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I wrote
"Intuitive Healing" is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
that people would come
up to me, and they say,

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:90%
I have intuitions occasionally.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll have a deja vu, or my
gut feeling will tell me

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.140 align:middle line:90%
this, that, or the other.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's not at my
fingertips every moment.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.780 align:middle line:84%
And as a psychiatrist
and intuitive,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I feel that it's so
important that we're

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in touch with our
intuition moment to moment,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:90%
not just occasionally.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.160 align:middle line:84%
So it can inform
everything that we do.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.200 align:middle line:84%
It can inform how we
walk down the street,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
how we can be present
in our body 100%

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and tuning in and feeling
everything, as opposed

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to just being in our minds
and worrying and thinking.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But being 100% in our body,
intuition will give us that.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And in particular for
people who are actually ill,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
which is often a
time when people

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:84%
may feel that their intuition
really is failing them.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I suggest that people
practice their intuition

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.930 align:middle line:84%
long before they could
get ill, if possible.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.490 align:middle line:90%
That's not always possible.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Because when you get in
touch with your body,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
when you learn to
listen to its signals,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
then when your body's
off, oftentimes intuition

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
can help you find
those subtler signals.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So when you do get
sick, then you really

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:84%
know how to track your
body and help heal it.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the problems, I think,
is that when people become ill,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
especially a serious illness,
that very strong emotions come

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.760 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
They begin blaming
themselves for it.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so true.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And particularly in
the new age, there's

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:84%
this idea that we create
our own illnesses.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And I really have a lot
of argument about that,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
because who in their
right mind would ever

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:90%
want to create an illness?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we
become ill, the premise

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
of intuitive feeling
is self compassion.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's looking at any
experience, including illness,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
as a way to open
the heart, as a way

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.970 align:middle line:84%
to learn about our bodies
and our intuitions,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
rather than an opportunity
for self punishment.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And you have a series
of steps that you recommend

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:90%
for people.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:84%
If they're confronting
any kind of a situation,

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:84%
these are steps that
will help people to get

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.470 align:middle line:90%
in touch with their intuitions.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, in each
section of the book,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.000 align:middle line:84%
I go through five steps in every
single chapter because these

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
are the steps I use in
my psychiatric practice,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
in my personal life,
and I teach my patients.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And I go through the steps
with everything I do.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.285 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote the
book, I thought,

00:03:24.285 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
what do I do that I can
teach everybody else?

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.980 align:middle line:84%
Because we all can
learn intuition.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have developed
these five steps.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And briefly they are
noticing positive beliefs

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:84%
about healing, which
is so important.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Developing beliefs that we could
connect with our innate healing

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
system and be a co-partner
in our own healing,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that's so important.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.390 align:middle line:84%
The second step is learning to
listen to the body's signals,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:84%
really getting in
touch with our bodies

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:84%
so we can hear what's going
on, as opposed from living

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.260 align:middle line:90%
from the neck up all the time.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And the third is
learning how to sense

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.100 align:middle line:84%
subtle energies or
the energy field

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
around the body, which
can affect our health

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And step four is learning
how to go in and ask

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:90%
for inner guidance.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.625 align:middle line:84%
The sacred act of
closing your eyes,

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of going inside, getting quiet,
and hearing that inner voice.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.780 align:middle line:90%
And we all have it.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I know I work
with people who feel

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.742 align:middle line:90%
they don't have an inner voice.

00:04:16.742 --> 00:04:19.105 align:middle line:84%
A lot of attorneys or bank
presidents are very linear.

00:04:19.105 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like when I tune
in, there's nothing there.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.313 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:23.763 align:middle line:90%
We all have this.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the fifth step,
which is my favorite,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.060 align:middle line:84%
is learning to listen
to dreams, night dreams,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
learning how to
remember and interpret

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
the incredible intuitions that
come through our night selves.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Every single night, we have
this great intuitive wellspring

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
that comes forth if we can
learn how to remember and tap

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.650 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it strikes me that it's
a good formula because if any

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
one of those methods
doesn't work,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.887 align:middle line:90%
one of the others is likely to.

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Jeffrey,
that's so right.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.887 align:middle line:84%
Because there's some times
when my intuition doesn't work,

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I've seen.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
If I'm very overly invested
in something, if I'm in love

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.677 align:middle line:84%
and I can't read
somebody, sometimes my

00:04:59.677 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:84%
going inside and asking for
inner guidance doesn't work.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
But at those moments where
I'm too personally involved,

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:90%
I turn to my dreams.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Because in the dream state,
there is no ego involved.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do and
what I teach people to do

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
is if you're stuck in
any aspect of your life,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.845 align:middle line:90%
to ask a question.

00:05:14.845 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's say, how can
I improve my health?

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:90%
Or how can I improve my energy?

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And ask a dream.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.207 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
morning get very quiet

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:84%
the first five minutes
you wake up, and then

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:90%
write the dream down.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And then see how the answer
applies to the question.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And I lead my life this way.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You suggest that people
can use these techniques with

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
their own doctor, in fact.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> With their own doctor,
absolutely, with themselves,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
in any situation
they'll ever be in.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
These are steps that
are internal steps.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.140 align:middle line:84%
You begin to activate them
and to become so familiar.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of kinesthetic
to living life, learning

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.210 align:middle line:84%
how to check in with
your body, sensing

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
how a person's
energy feels, seeing

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're drained
by other people,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.760 align:middle line:84%
or seeing of another person
gives you energy, which

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is a function of subtle energy.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And just noticing-- it's
like an artist's work.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Being an intuitive is
opening up to the artistry

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and the sensibilities of life.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Being totally open is a very
passionate way of living.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.090 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes it's interesting.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:84%
When we go to a doctor,
a doctor may be trained,

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.680 align:middle line:84%
especially these
days when they want

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to be open with their patients,
to say something to the effect

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.133 align:middle line:84%
like, well, you have
a chronic condition.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.300 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
learn to live with this pain

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:90%
the rest of your life.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.293 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Larry Dossey calls
this medical hexing.

00:06:31.293 --> 00:06:32.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what it is.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You implant these negative
beliefs in people.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
And we should never
listen to that.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We always need to
listen to what's inside

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and always know
that we can heal.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
In some shape or form, there's
always some option there.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I took intuitive healing
to the American Psychiatric

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Association convention, which
is a convention of the most

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
traditional psychiatrists
in the country.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what the response

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.000 align:middle line:84%
would be because
sometimes doctors

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:90%
can be a pretty rigid group.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.102 align:middle line:84%
And the people who attended
my workshop were so open,

00:07:00.102 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and they were psychiatrists
from the heartland,

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
from the Midwest
who said, I want

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.210 align:middle line:84%
to know how to use
these intuitive steps

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:90%
with my patients.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.088 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
each step with them,

00:07:08.088 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
and they took it back,
and they wrote me letters,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and they use it.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And this just makes
my heart sing.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Because my passion
is to change the face

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:84%
of traditional medicine to
bring back this sense of heart,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to bring back this sense of
deep intuition in the doctor,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.670 align:middle line:90%
as well as the patient.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about a
doctor being intuitive.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I help all my patients
to get in touch

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
with this sense of inner
self because then they

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.677 align:middle line:84%
can leave therapy and have
something very real inside

00:07:34.677 --> 00:07:37.010 align:middle line:84%
of themselves they can turn
to through the ups and downs

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I had, in my own
practice as a psychologist,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
an interesting case, a patient
who was really very intuitive.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.640 align:middle line:84%
But she kept insisting,
against all of my protests,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
that she did have to
come to accept that she

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:90%
had a chronic condition.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It was MS. And she felt that
all of the effort of people

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
to think that you
can heal yourself

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.400 align:middle line:84%
was getting in the
way of her coming

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:90%
to terms with her illness.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, she would
know best then.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
I always honor what
my patients say.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If that's what they feel,
then you go with it.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
You help them in their own path.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I never try and project what
I believe is best for them

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:90%
onto someone.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Always intuitive healing is
about listening to the person

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and going with what
they believe in.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But healing comes in
all shapes and forms.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the body does
not heal completely

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.260 align:middle line:84%
of chronic pain or
chronic illness.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:90%
And yet the heart opens.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.340 align:middle line:84%
And so what is the
ultimate healing?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.549 align:middle line:84%
You always have to look at
illness as an opportunity

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
to open the heart, or anything
that we go through in the ups

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.659 align:middle line:90%
and downs of life.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing
"Intuitive Healing,"

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I had a very clear premise.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was that love is
the most powerful healing

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
force in the universe, and
everything comes from that.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And that means emotional
healing, physical healing,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:90%
sexual healing.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And if we really
believe that-- and we

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:90%
have to believe it in our soul.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a matter
of thinking it--

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
then we must apply it to
everything we ever go through.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
>> But certainly we
know that our bodies,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.530 align:middle line:84%
each and every one of us,
our physical body will come

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:84%
to a point where it
will stop functioning.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Then healing, intuitive
healing isn't going to overcome

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.810 align:middle line:90%
the death of the physical body.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:16.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Part of my definition of
intuitive healing is wellness,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:84%
and it could be illness,
or it could be death.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Because death is a form of
powerful intuitive healing

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:90%
that is a wonderful thing.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.730 align:middle line:84%
I firmly believe that
the spirit lives on.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
And I know this because it's
an intuitive experience.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And I take readers
through a meditation,

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.725 align:middle line:84%
an intuitive healing about how
to experience death firsthand.

00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You've written in a very
powerful way about the death

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.080 align:middle line:90%
of your father.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I was with both my parents
at their deathbeds,

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:49.640 align:middle line:84%
and when I was
with my father, he

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
died of Parkinson's
disease, which is

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.330 align:middle line:90%
a severe neurologic disorder.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And he was a physician.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:90%
And he gave up everything.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:90%
He gave up his mind.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.040 align:middle line:90%
His linear mind went.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.450 align:middle line:90%
He became demented.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.622 align:middle line:90%
Somebody had to walk him.

00:10:00.622 --> 00:10:01.580 align:middle line:90%
He had to wear diapers.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:90%
He lost everything.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And so as his daughter,
I was his sole caretaker,

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
and I was able to be with him.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And all through his illness
and his dying process,

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.692 align:middle line:90%
I tuned into my intuition.

00:10:12.692 --> 00:10:14.150 align:middle line:84%
When I felt that
the Earth was just

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
being ripped apart
beneath my feet,

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.978 align:middle line:90%
I tuned in to my intuition.

00:10:17.978 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And my intuition said, your
heart has grown this large.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to the
fear, which says,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.440 align:middle line:90%
oh my god, this is so horrible.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Intuition gets us in touch with
our deepest truth and affirms

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.110 align:middle line:84%
who we are, as
opposed to letting

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
us become submerged by fears
that really doesn't dictate

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.386 align:middle line:90%
who we truly are.

00:10:38.386 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Judith, we're
going to take a short break.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.456 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back in
just a few moments.

00:10:45.456 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.165 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:51.965 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:10:51.965 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Dr. Judith
Orloff about intuitive healing.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
Judith, right before
our break, you

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.290 align:middle line:84%
were talking about the
death of your father

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:84%
and how suffering from
Parkinson's disease,

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
he lost virtually everything
gradually up until his death.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And it strikes me that when that
happens, when people lose first

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
maybe their social status,
their profession, and then even

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.580 align:middle line:84%
the use of their physical body,
to the point where perhaps they

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
can't even speak,
at the same time,

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.780 align:middle line:84%
they're growing closer to
a kind of spiritual purity.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so true.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
When my father was a doctor for
so many years in Beverly Hills,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:90%
he had a very linear mind.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:33.085 align:middle line:90%
He was a radiologist.

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
When people would say, what
do you think of Judith's work

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.380 align:middle line:90%
with intuition?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, well, if
she's doing it, it must be good.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.880 align:middle line:84%
But I've really never
experienced anything like this.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great sign of respect
my father said that to me.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But as he became demented,
he began opening up

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:90%
to intuitive experiences.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And he actually had a vision
of his very best friend who

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
came to him the night before
she died in a black death shroud

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
sitting at the foot of his
bed and coming to say goodbye

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.100 align:middle line:90%
to him.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And the next day,
she died, and he

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.450 align:middle line:90%
had no idea that was going on.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.580 align:middle line:84%
And so he opened up to
these intuitive experiences.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And as his daughter, I was able
to be there with him and go,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that's beautiful that you
had this connection of love

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
with your friend
and you saw her.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to, oh my
god, he's hallucinating.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
He's getting crazier
and so forth,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
which the traditional
medical model might say.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm so
familiar with intuition

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:84%
and it's so incredibly
beautiful and natural to me,

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I was able to be
there for my father

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
as he opened up
with the dementia.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Not all people with dementia
open up in this way,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:90%
but my father really did.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
You point out that people
can use these intuitive tools

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
in the face of virtually
every horrible condition they

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:90%
might be confronted with.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, you talk about
the inner darkness, depression

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and mental illness,
even psychosis.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Many of us are confronted with
these things in our friends

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.970 align:middle line:84%
and loved ones,
if not ourselves.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:00.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.540 align:middle line:84%
Intuitive healing
is about learning

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:84%
to go through any
experience we have,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
dark or light, with compassion,
trying to learn from it.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And no matter who
I'm working with,

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:84%
if it's someone with
a physical illness

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
or a psychiatric
illness, I always

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
help them find this
inner voice or go

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.587 align:middle line:84%
into the voice of
the illness itself.

00:13:19.587 --> 00:13:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And if there's one thing I've
learned as a psychiatrist,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
it's that there's an
integrity to illness.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
It has a language, and you
have to learn how to speak it.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
You don't just try and
subdue the symptoms.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.200 align:middle line:84%
You go into the symptom,
and you hear what it says.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The language,
though, is intuitive.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not linear.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:90%
It's intuitive.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.235 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes
you'll have images,

00:13:38.235 --> 00:13:41.280 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes gut feelings
or dreams will come through.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.400 align:middle line:84%
But if you go into
the body itself,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:84%
it can tell you how
to help heal it.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I do with
myself if I ever get sick

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
and with my patients.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And another
point that you make,

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
which we don't hear very often,
is that sexual healing is just

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.143 align:middle line:84%
as important as physical
or emotional healing.

00:13:58.143 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well you know what I
love about this life and this

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
body that we have is that
there's so many aspects to it.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I am passionate about
is being as whole as possible,

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
not splitting off
parts of myself.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.890 align:middle line:84%
To be an emotional
being, a spiritual being,

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
a sexual being, and to have
all the energy in my body

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:84%
open in that way, but
in a very balanced way.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Now I believe that that's the
presence of a true healer.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Because when someone has
really worked on themselves

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.290 align:middle line:84%
in these different areas,
others can feel it.

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
balancing feeling.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.968 align:middle line:90%
It's like a beautiful sun.

00:14:29.968 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
You get next to someone,
and it feels good.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It's an intuitive
experience of subtle energy,

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.567 align:middle line:90%
which is the third step.

00:14:35.567 --> 00:14:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And when you work on
these areas and someone

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is comfortable with it, then
it sparks other's healing.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the point
of intuitive healing.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not just talking about it.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
It's actually going inside,
changing, and then changing

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:84%
your being, how
you feel to others.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my sense is when you
talk about using intuition this

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
way as a healer and
listening to the body,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
sharing subtle energies in
a healing way with people,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that anybody who is on a path
of self-awareness and spiritual

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.700 align:middle line:84%
growth is sooner or later
going to naturally move in this

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.990 align:middle line:90%
direction.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:13.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people are
just longing for it.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.990 align:middle line:90%
They're yearning for it.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I speak all over and give
lectures, and I hear people--

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
I love listening to
people's stories.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's a deep yearning
amongst so many people

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:84%
to contact this intuition,
this sense of spirituality.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
just pulls them.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And so for those people, they'll
just go towards it naturally.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But I've got to say there is
not one person I haven't been

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
able to teach to dream,
to intuitively listen

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
to themselves if there's
at all that desire there.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:90%
There was a woman who called me.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:84%
She was a semi truck
driver, and she called me.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
She was driving her truck in
the middle of the country.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I'm
listening to your tape,

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and I'm listening to my
intuition as I'm driving.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was just so
incredible because anything

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:84%
you do, you bring your
intuition into it.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of harmonizing
with whatever you do.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I have to agree.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:16:01.330 align:middle line:84%
As some viewers know, I'm the
president of an organization

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:90%
called the Intuition Network.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the premises
that I hold is that we use

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
our intuition every moment
of every day of our lives.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.420 align:middle line:84%
It's always there in one way
or another in the background.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's true.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.695 align:middle line:84%
But some people don't recognize
experiences as intuitive.

00:16:18.695 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:84%
For instance, when
I was a little girl,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't go into shopping
malls or crowded places

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.613 align:middle line:84%
because I'd go in feeling fine
and walk out totally exhausted.

00:16:26.613 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd go to my
parents, and they said,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.155 align:middle line:84%
oh, dear, you don't have
a thick enough skin,

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:90%
or you're overly sensitive.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.450 align:middle line:84%
But what they didn't realize
was that as an intuitive,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.748 align:middle line:84%
as a sensitive, I picked up
energy in crowded places.

00:16:37.748 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
And when you have lots of
people jammed together,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
you have all these energy
fields intersecting.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And anyone who's sensitive to
this will become overwhelmed.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with
agoraphobics or people

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.150 align:middle line:84%
with panic disorder,
I always ask them,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.340 align:middle line:84%
what's it like for
you to be in crowds?

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.290 align:middle line:84%
How are you around lots
and lots of energy?

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And if they say
I'm not all right,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
then often there's an element
of intuitive empathy there,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
so I teach them
grounding techniques.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
I teach them how to
protect themselves.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a whole element
of psychiatry and healing

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:90%
that is totally overlooked.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, here you are speaking
to a national television

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.420 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.640 align:middle line:84%
You're an accredited
psychiatrist.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.520 align:middle line:84%
You've done
parapsychology research

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory at UCLA.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You've really
established yourself

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.589 align:middle line:84%
as a psychic and an intuitive
and a voice of authority.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But at one time,
it wasn't so easy.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Your parents, for
example, who loved

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.260 align:middle line:84%
you very much from
all accounts also

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:90%
wanted to suppress this side.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:90%
>> They did.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.065 align:middle line:84%
I grew up a very intuitive
child in Beverly Hills.

00:17:38.065 --> 00:17:39.565 align:middle line:84%
And both my parents
were physicians.

00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:41.993 align:middle line:84%
I have 25 physicians
in my family.

00:17:41.993 --> 00:17:44.410 align:middle line:84%
And here I was this little
girl that could pick things up.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.560 align:middle line:84%
I could pick up deaths and
illnesses and earthquakes.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And finally my parents
got so exasperated,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:84%
they just said, never mention
anything else in our home

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:90%
again about this.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up believing there
was something wrong with me

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
that I was able to sense
and know about these things.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And so my healing
journey has been

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:84%
coming to terms with
this intuitive self

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and making it a part of my work
as a psychiatrist, as a human

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:84%
being, as a woman, not
splitting off parts of myself,

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:84%
but being everything
all at once.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that this is so
important because in my past,

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I never felt safe to
express my intuitions.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And now it's my passion.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Having found my voice
is the greatest gift

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I've ever been given.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
>> You describe sometimes
the necessity to listen

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:84%
to an intuition, even when
it goes against what we may

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:90%
logically think is correct.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, at one
time in your career,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.860 align:middle line:84%
you got the intuition
that you were

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
going to pursue the path
of being a medical doctor,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
even though you had spent
much of your life rebelling

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.090 align:middle line:84%
against that very
aspect of your family.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
When I was 20, I was
living with my boyfriend

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.710 align:middle line:84%
in Venice Beach in this old
converted brick laundromat.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in the towel
department in the maid company.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was working in a
parapsychology lab at that time

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.530 align:middle line:90%
at UCLA also as a volunteer.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And I had this dream that
came to me that told me

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I was going to get an MD
to become a psychiatrist

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to help legitimize
intuition in medicine.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And this was at a time when
I had no desire whatsoever

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
to go into medicine.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But because I was beginning
to honor this intuitive

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:84%
part of myself, I enrolled in
one course in a junior college

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:90%
just to see how it would go.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And one became two became 14
years of medical training.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.155 align:middle line:84%
And so I had an intuitive dream
that signaled my true calling.

00:19:27.155 --> 00:19:29.025 align:middle line:90%
And thank god I listened.

00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Because many of my patients
and many people I know,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:90%
you get these kind of dreams.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's so impractical,
or the rational mind

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
doesn't understand it,
so you don't do it.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.560 align:middle line:90%
And you miss out on so much.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:84%
And part of the message
of intuitive healing

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%
is listen to these dreams.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Listen to these intuitions
that are signaling a closer

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.260 align:middle line:84%
relationship with
your truer self.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Have the guts to act on it, and
miraculous things will happen.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Because oftentimes it seems
as if illness results when we

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.850 align:middle line:90%
don't listen to our intuitions.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.755 align:middle line:90%
Our body rebels.

00:19:57.755 --> 00:19:59.380 align:middle line:84%
If we do something
that's off, it we'll

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:90%
keep turning up the volume.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:84%
One intuition that we
have is exhaustion.

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.770 align:middle line:84%
That's our body's signal
that's telling us, slow down.

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't, then
we'll get symptoms.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.322 align:middle line:84%
If we don't, then we'll
get larger symptoms

00:20:10.322 --> 00:20:11.445 align:middle line:90%
and larger symptoms.

00:20:11.445 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that our body
is trying to torment us.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.190 align:middle line:90%
It's trying to wake us up.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.480 align:middle line:84%
But our minds are so
persistently counterintuitive

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
that intuitive
healing means coming

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to grips with what the body says
and honoring it and changing

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.340 align:middle line:90%
our life accordingly.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And then the sense of joy and
commitment and joy of living

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.700 align:middle line:90%
will come back.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You tell a wonderful story
in your book about being

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.250 align:middle line:84%
in a woman's prison,
working with women,

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
people who we might think
are beyond redemption

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:90%
because they're criminals.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.950 align:middle line:90%
And you point out that even--

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the mind.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> --even in those situations,
the intuition can be a very

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:90%
vibrant, vital force.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
I spoke at this women's prison
in Danbury, Connecticut.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%
150 women came.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Took their free time off,
which is a big thing,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to come to this workshop.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them, how many of
you listen to your intuition?

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.975 align:middle line:84%
How many of you knew that
something was off when

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:90%
you committed these crimes?

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And nearly the whole
room raised their hand.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why
didn't you listen?

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.610 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we just
wanted to go ahead with it.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
We didn't listen.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.285 align:middle line:84%
We didn't believe in
our intuition, whatever.

00:21:18.285 --> 00:21:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And we ended up here.

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And now the whole group
went into meditation,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
150 people in this prison,
with the prison yard

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.988 align:middle line:84%
outside blaring with
the voices coming

00:21:27.988 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:90%
through the loudspeakers.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And there are 150
women meditating,

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:90%
doing intuitive healing.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And long ago, I've
given up any kind

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:90%
of stereotype of who does this.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Now this is a human endeavor.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
If anyone is interested
in intuitive healing,

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.770 align:middle line:84%
it can open up just
a beautiful garden

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:84%
inside that just keeps getting
larger and larger and larger.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.200 align:middle line:90%
There's no end to it.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself a perpetual
student of intuition.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter how many
times, in other words,

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:57.045 align:middle line:84%
that we have failed to
listen to our intuitions,

00:21:57.045 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
we can always turn that around.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't listen
for so long, but I

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
learned by when I didn't listen,
only bad things happened.

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I did listen, only
wonderful things happened,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
but I had to go through a
period of that battering of not

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:90%
listening.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The willfulness that says,
no, but I want it to happen.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
My intuition is
saying, no, but it's

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
not going to happen right now.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:18.905 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm going to
push through it.

00:22:18.905 --> 00:22:19.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the mind.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.782 align:middle line:84%
So you have to go through
those kind of struggles

00:22:21.782 --> 00:22:24.840 align:middle line:84%
to realize if you listen,
wonderful things always happen.

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's human to go
through the struggle.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> The struggle does seem human.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.630 align:middle line:90%
I know I go through it.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But you suggest that
everybody can reach a point

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
where we can feel very confident
of all of our decisions.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes you
don't feel confident.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the fear
is going, I'm afraid.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But your intuition is
saying, yes, go ahead.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to decide what
you want to listen to.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing is if you
listen to your intuition enough

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and it affirms you enough, at
that moment when you're unsure,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:90%
you'll go with your intuition.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Judith Orloff, thank you
so much for being with me.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:90%
It's been a joy.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it was a joy
for me too, Jeffrey.

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
