00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Today we're going to explore
the mystery of consciousness.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Peter
Russell, a fellow

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
of the Institute of Noetic
Sciences in Sausalito,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
California.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Peter has written numerous
books, including the TM book,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.270 align:middle line:84%
"The Brain Book," a
translation of the Upanishads,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
"Waking Up in Time," "The
Global Brain," and "From Science

to God."

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Peter.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.477 align:middle line:90%
Lovely to be with you today.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be living
in a culture that

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.080 align:middle line:84%
has some very schizophrenic
ideas about consciousness.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science
today is just,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I think, starting to accept
the notion that consciousness

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is something they ought
to begin to deal with.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I think consciousness
is the great problem

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:10%
for the scientific culture.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:10%
It's fascinating.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:10%
It's the one thing
we cannot deny.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:10%
Each and every one of
us is a conscious being.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.970 align:middle line:10%
We have inner
experiences all the time.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:10%
Every scientist is
a conscious being.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:10%
The one thing that science
cannot explain is how

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:10%
consciousness arises.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And you're right.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.203 align:middle line:10%
At the moment, there's
a lot of people

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:10%
beginning to look at that.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're
probably on the wrong track.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.965 align:middle line:84%
They're beginning to look
at how it might arise out

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
of physics, out of quantum
theory, these sorts of things.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for
virtually a century,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.730 align:middle line:84%
it seemed as if science simply
tried to deny that there was

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.130 align:middle line:90%
even a problem there at all.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I think this always
happens with problems.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
It's what Thomas
Kuhn showed when he

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:90%
talked about paradigm shifts.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.725 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
at the beginning

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.703 align:middle line:90%
is science ignores the problem.

00:02:07.703 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And they did that
for a long time.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.912 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry
about consciousness.

00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Partly modern science seems
to understand the functioning

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.000 align:middle line:84%
of the material world perfectly
well without any need to go

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness, until
it comes to the fact that we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.870 align:middle line:84%
cannot explain at all
why we have awareness.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually easier
to explain the Big Bang

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and how elements evolved
into atoms and atoms evolved

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
into molecules, which
became simple systems, which

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
evolved into human
beings like ourselves.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
That is easier to understand
than why any one of us

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.130 align:middle line:90%
ever has a single thought.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it strikes me, Peter,
that the problem runs even

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:90%
deeper.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because many cultures in
other historical periods

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.540 align:middle line:84%
didn't have this problem
with consciousness.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.290 align:middle line:84%
It's unique, I think,
to Western culture,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and particularly in the
19th and 20th centuries.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.720 align:middle line:84%
It strikes me that the
20th century certainly

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.830 align:middle line:84%
was the bloodiest century in
human history, a dark century--

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
two world wars,
many massive periods

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:84%
of starvation, social
alienation, and revolution.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And I tend to think that
that sort of social darkness

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.130 align:middle line:84%
is not unrelated to
the fact that we lived

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
during that century in an
era in which consciousness

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.140 align:middle line:84%
itself wasn't even recognized
by the major social institution

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of inquiry, being science.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Science just didn't want
to look at it at all.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think now it
is being forced to,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
and I think several
things are forcing it.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.240 align:middle line:84%
One, there's things in physics
like in quantum physics

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and relativity
where consciousness

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.610 align:middle line:84%
seems to play a part
in what we observe.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And now in terms of our
brain, understanding

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.030 align:middle line:84%
of the brain, which is probably
one of the fastest growing

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.737 align:middle line:84%
areas of science,
we're coming up

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:55.320 align:middle line:84%
against the question
of consciousness.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.830 align:middle line:84%
We can understand so much
now about the human brain.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:90%
There's still a lot more to go.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But that raises the question
of what is consciousness?

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And how does
consciousness emerge?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, philosophers such as
David Chalmers talk about it

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
as the hard problem, that you
can't get from here to there.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
From a materialistic worldview,
you simply cannot arrive at any

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:84%
sort of mechanism which is
required by materialism that

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:90%
will lead you to consciousness.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The two are totally
different types.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:84%
The material world, we assume,
is unconscious and material.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.435 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
immaterial and conscious.

00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So how does something as
immaterial as consciousness

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.280 align:middle line:84%
ever arise from something
as unconscious as matter?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%
That's the hard problem.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's, in a
way, the question is wrong.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
We are assuming that the
real world is the material

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:90%
world of spacetime and matter.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem, I
think, that modern science

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
has got stuck in
this worldview that

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:90%
says that is the real world.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we are posed with
the question, well then,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
how does consciousness
arise from it?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it does.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.270 align:middle line:90%
My view is consciousness is--

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> If we let go of that
metaphysical assumption made

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.080 align:middle line:84%
by materialistic science, the
problem of consciousness no

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.850 align:middle line:84%
longer seems like
such a problem.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a first
cause, a principle.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, which is what
a lot of the great spiritual

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
traditions and philosophers
have said all along,

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is that consciousness is,
and it's a primary quality

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
>> On the other
hand, in science,

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
there is an effort to describe
how consciousness would evolve

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.558 align:middle line:84%
from neurobiology, how computer
models might have something

00:05:36.558 --> 00:05:37.600 align:middle line:90%
to do with consciousness.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.730 align:middle line:84%
After all, memory seems to be
a property of computer systems.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Perception is a
property of neurons.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I'm not so sure it is.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, let me say sensation.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> They are clearly involved
in mediating the process.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I think it comes back
to saying that if we believe

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the material world is
real, then we think

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:90%
that they are the cause of it.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But I think they're
part of the mediation.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't think they
actually create experience.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think neurons
create consciousness.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.980 align:middle line:84%
They may be amplifiers
of what is going on,

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and they may help create the
details of our experience.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think they
create experience itself.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, David Chalmers
sometimes talks about--

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
he's a professor,
studies consciousness.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We've interviewed him, the
University of California Santa

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Cruz.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.920 align:middle line:84%
He suggests there are the easy
problems and the hard problems.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The easy problems might
be, how is it that when I see,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I see you and not just a bunch
of patches of light and forum,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.840 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
coherence to my vision?

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
That's a problem,
perhaps, for neurology.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:10%
And these are all
the easy problems.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:10%
How does memory work?

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:10%
How does perception work?

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.120 align:middle line:10%
How do we control the body?

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:10%
How do thoughts arise?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:10%
The easy problems are
to do with understanding

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.282 align:middle line:10%
the neurophysiology.

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:55.990 align:middle line:10%
They're called easy,
but they're probably

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:10%
the most difficult
problems we've faced.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But the point is, ultimately
we may be able to understand

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:90%
those easy problems.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:84%
We may be able to understand
how the brain analyzes

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
a visual scene in front of
us and reconstitutes that

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:90%
into a picture.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
But the hard problem is even
when we understand all of that,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
why should any of that
processing in the brain ever

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.200 align:middle line:84%
give rise to a
subjective experience?

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Why does it all
go on in the dark?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.290 align:middle line:90%
That's the hard problem.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's pointing
towards something fundamentally

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
wrong with the current
scientific worldview.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet scientists
don't see that.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.973 align:middle line:84%
They keep on trying
to explain that

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:34.640 align:middle line:84%
within the current
scientific worldview.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So some people like
Hameroff believe

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
it's to do with
tiny microtubules

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.123 align:middle line:84%
in the brain cells, which you
can get coherent functions

00:07:43.123 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:84%
happening there, laser
like effects with water

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
molecules, which
he suggests maybe

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.255 align:middle line:90%
is the source of consciousness.

00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:51.130 align:middle line:84%
But you're still faced
with the hard problem,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:84%
how does a quantum process
give rise to something

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.640 align:middle line:84%
as subjective as
our own experience?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest twist
in this whole paradox

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
is that in the end, all we
ever know is consciousness.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.257 align:middle line:84%
We don't actually know
the world of matter.

00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, right now,
we're sitting here.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.465 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing
the world around us.

00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:10%
This table seems very real.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:10%
But all I'm actually
knowing is the re-creation

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:10%
in my consciousness, in
my mind, of this table

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:10%
with its color
and its solidness,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:10%
and I'm hearing the
sound of your voice.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:10%
But all of that is a
creation in consciousness.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:10%
>> A simulation, so to speak.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, it's all a
simulation of the world.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:10%
>> And the simulation
is obviously conditioned

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.840 align:middle line:10%
by our apparatus.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.750 align:middle line:10%
But what I'm saying
is in the end,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.870 align:middle line:10%
the only thing we know
for certain is actually

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
The world of spacetime
and matter is secondary.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:90%
We know it through inference.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a very
interesting point.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite contrary to the
basic axioms of empiricism,

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.578 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that the
material world is primary

00:08:54.578 --> 00:08:55.870 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness is secondary.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and that's the shift
that I think we have to reverse

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.880 align:middle line:90%
that whole polarity.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.503 align:middle line:84%
>> William James developed what
he called radical empiricism,

00:09:04.503 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:90%
in which he made that point.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, he was stepping
in that direction,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.430 align:middle line:84%
that we need to really
trust our experience.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the fundamental
datum is experience.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And experience takes
place in consciousness.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I should mention for
the benefit of our viewers,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
William James is considered the
founder of American psychology

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%
and lived around a century ago.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:84%
But many great thinkers
have made the same point.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Sir Arthur Eddington
in physics--

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I think and many physicists.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, Schrodinger,
we have Schrodinger's wave

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Erwin Schrodinger.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, one of the
great quantum physicists.

00:09:38.205 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
He was saying in the end,
the ultimate reality is mind.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And he came to that
conclusion as a physicist.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:90%
The ultimate reality is mind.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems to me that
many people suggest since we

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
can't seem to even conceivably
derive consciousness from

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:84%
physical systems, maybe
consciousness is primary.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.110 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's what I'm
arguing for in my book.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.290 align:middle line:10%
If we make consciousness
primary, what is interesting,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.355 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't change a single
thing in modern science.

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't change
any of physics.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.272 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't change
any of mathematics.

00:10:11.272 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't change biology.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.620 align:middle line:10%
All of that is exactly the same.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:10%
But what it does do is
offer some interesting new

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:10%
interpretations of
some things which

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.558 align:middle line:10%
are happening in quantum
physics and relativity

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:10%
where consciousness
gets involved.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't actually
change the mathematics at all.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.960 align:middle line:84%
What it does do is open us up
to a whole new understanding

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.892 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality,
and I think what

00:10:31.892 --> 00:10:33.350 align:middle line:84%
all the great
teachers have been on

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:90%
about for thousands of years.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
probably why humanity,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
the human race is creating
such havoc when you talk

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
about the bloody
wars and things,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.823 align:middle line:84%
is because we're living in
a spiritually arid time.

00:10:46.823 --> 00:10:47.990 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know who we are.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We've lost touch with
our spiritual roots,

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:84%
and religion is sort of put
right back on the back shelf.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Some people go to
church on Sundays.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Most don't even do that.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.593 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality has dropped
right out of our culture.

00:10:59.593 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is what
is interesting about making

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.310 align:middle line:84%
this shift in worldview,
is that it actually

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.600 align:middle line:84%
allows spiritual wisdom
to come in and sit side

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.560 align:middle line:84%
by side with the scientific
worldview without any conflict.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's expanding the
worldview so that both

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.490 align:middle line:90%
can sit comfortably together.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Peter, we're going
to take a break.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.618 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:24.462 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:24.462 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed."

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
mystery of consciousness.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Peter
Russell, author

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.330 align:middle line:90%
of "From Science to God."

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Peter, you described
previously the notion

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness might just be
primary, even more fundamental

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
than space and time,
matter and energy.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, to give the
materialists their due,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.720 align:middle line:84%
their position generally is that
consciousness is not primary,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
it's an emergent phenomenon.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.380 align:middle line:84%
It emerges from
material systems.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.140 align:middle line:90%
Some call it an epiphenomenon.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And they argue that
there are other emergent

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:90%
phenomenon in nature.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Why shouldn't consciousness
be one of them?

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think two reasons.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.680 align:middle line:10%
First of all, this
is only a belief.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:10%
There is no evidence
whatsoever that consciousness

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:10%
is an emergent phenomenon.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:10%
But you have to
come to that belief

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.770 align:middle line:10%
if you accept that spacetime
and matter are primary.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:10%
You are led to some sort
of philosophy like that.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:10%
And sorry, what's the other
question you asked me?

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to just
give them their due.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.660 align:middle line:84%
They point out that many
things are like life itself.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, other things
emerge-- right,

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
but those other things that are
emergent are of the same type.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about life, life
is of the same type as matter.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a living cell
is a material entity.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The laws which govern
the living cell

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
are an emergent phenomenon
that have emerged,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and they are something new.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can say the
same thing with society.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
The laws that govern society
is an emergent phenomenon

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:90%
that have come out of life.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're still laws
of the physical world.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness does not
belong to the physical world.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And so you cannot have something
which is of a totally different

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.672 align:middle line:84%
type emerging from
the material type.

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:20.380 align:middle line:10%
>> I want to be fair
to the materialists,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.400 align:middle line:10%
because I know that if there
were such a person in the room,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:10%
he would debate you vigorously--

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:10%
>> He may well do.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:10%
>> --on this point--

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.110 align:middle line:10%
>> And I would debate
him vigorously.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> --for days.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that
needs to be pointed out.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.010 align:middle line:90%
A very, I think, very--

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I want to say strong, but I
will say detailed arguments can

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
be made on behalf
of the position

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness
might just be emergent.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but I think all those
arguments are founded upon

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.163 align:middle line:84%
the assumption that the
spacetime matter world is real.

00:13:53.163 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
is the assumption

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:90%
we need to challenge.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very parallel to
what happened 500 years ago,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
when everybody thought the Earth
was the center of the universe

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:90%
and it was still.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.375 align:middle line:84%
And people like
Copernicus came along

00:14:05.375 --> 00:14:06.740 align:middle line:90%
and suggested the Earth moved.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
that is ridiculous.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.770 align:middle line:84%
There is no evidence
whatsoever the Earth is moving.

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
If it was, thing would
fly across the room.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is clearly still.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.743 align:middle line:90%
Don't be so ridiculous.

00:14:18.743 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the belief
system everybody was stuck in.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And I think the same today.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
We are all stuck in
this belief system

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
that spacetime and
matter are real.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And people can argue
very coherently

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
about that within
that assumption.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, when you
say we're all stuck,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
what you really mean are people
who subscribe to scientific

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:90%
materialism.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, yes.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That's actually,
I would estimate,

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.520 align:middle line:84%
even in the Western world
maybe 25% of the populations.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
actual percentage is, yes.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.240 align:middle line:84%
When I say we all, I should
rephrase that more accurately,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:84%
most scientists, the
majority of scientists.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Other people tend to
have a religious worldview

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
or a philosophical worldview
that is larger than just

00:14:58.660 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:90%
scientific materialism.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet scientific
materialism seems

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to be the worldview by
which our culture operates,

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
which our political institutions
and legal institutes,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.168 align:middle line:84%
everything works
on that assumption.

00:15:10.168 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Although, as you
say, a lot of people

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
don't actually agree
with that underneath.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:18.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even our legal
system believes very firmly

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
in free will and
human choice, which

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.960 align:middle line:84%
total scientific materialism
doesn't allow for.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.218 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a
strange one when you

00:15:26.218 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:84%
get scientists who choose
not to believe in free will.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:35.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are very venerable
structures in our society that

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
hold a view of consciousness
that's quite different from

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:90%
the view of science.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, most people think
it odd to believe that we

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.890 align:middle line:90%
have no free will at all.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:84%
But that's why, you see,
I think consciousness

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
paradigm breaker

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:90%
for the scientific worldview.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Because science, as you
say, is leaving it out,

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:57.018 align:middle line:90%
leaving it out at the moment.

00:15:57.018 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of surprising that
it ever got to this point where

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.383 align:middle line:84%
scientists had become so
alienated from something

00:16:03.383 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
as basic as consciousness
and free will.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in a way, that
probably goes back to Descartes.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Because what Descartes
did was he said,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
let's divide the world up
into this res extensa--

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:17.003 align:middle line:84%
that's Latin for meaning
things with extension in space.

00:16:17.003 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Extension in space.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's res cogitans,
which is things in the mind.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said in order not
to alienate the Vatican,

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.920 align:middle line:84%
because he'd already seen people
like Bruno burnt at the stake

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.835 align:middle line:84%
for supporting
Copernicus and ideas that

00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:29.835 align:middle line:90%
went against the church.

00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, we'll leave things
to do with consciousness,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.670 align:middle line:90%
the mind, to the church.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let science
deal with things

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that exist in space and
time, things with extension.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And so science went ahead
exploring-- if I simplify,

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:84%
basically science
went ahead exploring

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
the world of
space-time and matter

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:90%
and left consciousness aside.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And consciousness moved--
the philosophers started

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%
exploring consciousness.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.260 align:middle line:84%
There became many
great philosophers

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:56.468 align:middle line:84%
who looked into that, and
we have the whole tradition

00:16:56.468 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
of European philosophy,
a lot of which

00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:90%
was exploring consciousness.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And then it moved
into psychology.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:10%
And now today we're seeing that
whole trend, the exploration

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, coming to a
point where we're saying we now

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:10%
have to go back and re-look
at our scientific worldview

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.339 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps bring
them back together.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:10%
That split that
Descartes made, it's

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.560 align:middle line:10%
now time to join the
two back together again,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:10%
and so bring the world
of matter together

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:10%
with the world of spirit.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.349 align:middle line:84%
>> You write quite a bit
about the explorations

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
into consciousness of the
philosopher Immanuel Kant.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:28.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, Immanuel Kant, I think,
is probably as important in this

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:90%
as Copernicus was.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Kant himself,
without being arrogant,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.680 align:middle line:84%
he suggested his ideas were
going to trigger a Copernican

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.630 align:middle line:90%
revolution in philosophy.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And it took Copernicus 150 years
before his ideas were proven.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
the same with Kant.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
It's only 200 years ago
that Kant was writing.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And what Kant said,
which I think is--

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:84%
he said many things, but I
think the crucial thing here,

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
he said there are,
again, two worlds.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:84%
There is the world
we experience,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
which is the phenomena that
arise in our experience.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is the world out
there, which gives rise to it.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
So there is this table.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But he said all we ever
know of this table is

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:15.800 align:middle line:84%
what we experience, is the forms
that arise in consciousness.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.080 align:middle line:84%
When I see there's
a blue color here,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.210 align:middle line:84%
he would say there's
no blue out there.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't even know
about modern physics.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:10%
The blue is purely
a quality which

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:10%
arises in consciousness
in response

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:10%
to a particular frequency
of vibration of light.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:10%
But there's no blue
in the physical world.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.160 align:middle line:10%
There's just a
frequency of vibration.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:10%
>> We could even argue from
the point of view of pure

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.410 align:middle line:10%
physicality, there's
nothing solid here.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.840 align:middle line:10%
>> No, this is
99.9999999% empty space.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:49.007 align:middle line:84%
An atom is like a pea in the
middle of the football stadium

00:18:49.007 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:84%
with other peas revolving
around the stands.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.370 align:middle line:90%
There's that much empty space.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:84%
But because of electromagnetic
forces and the way

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:84%
atoms are bound together,
the empty space of my hand

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
will not pass through the
empty space of the table.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And so I have the
appearance of solidness.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's what solidness is,
is the fact that these things

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:90%
won't permeate each other.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we think of them
as physically solid,

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.870 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:15.613 align:middle line:84%
That's just part of the model
we create in our experience.

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Which would be consistent
with Kant's philosophy.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.150 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And so Kant was
saying all we ever

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.170 align:middle line:84%
know is what arises in
consciousness, which is really,

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I think, what a lot of the
great old Eastern philosophers

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
are saying, that
all we ever know

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness and the
arisings in consciousness.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
many yogis and great saints

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.800 align:middle line:84%
have come to experience through
years and years of meditation,

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.990 align:middle line:84%
of exploration of their
own consciousness.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.570 align:middle line:84%
They've come to
experience that everything

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.040 align:middle line:90%
is an arising in the mind.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Everything they know is an
arising in consciousness.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.802 align:middle line:84%
And in that, I think there
is an incredible freedom.

00:19:51.802 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
That's what they talk about,
is that freedom from thinking,

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
that I am at the
mercy of the world,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.760 align:middle line:84%
as well as, I am continually
the author of my own experience.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In that sense, one might say
that all of our so-called hard

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
sciences-- physics,
chemistry, biology--

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
are descriptions of
our consciousness.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they are is they
are taking our consciousness

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and then from that,
trying to arrive

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.900 align:middle line:84%
at a description of
the external world.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And what we arrive
at is various models.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And models are just
ideas in consciousness.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And an electron is a model
that human consciousness

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.730 align:middle line:84%
has invented to describe
certain experiences

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:90%
and certain experiments.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.353 align:middle line:90%
No one's ever seen an electron.

00:20:35.353 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And what we know
an electron, it's

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
nothing like we
think it might be.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly not
a solid particle.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just a model.

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And you could say all
of science is an attempt

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.550 align:middle line:84%
to take that data of
consciousness, that

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
arise in consciousness,
and from that form

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
maps of what that underlying
reality out there is actually

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:90%
like.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from the point of
view of Eastern mysticism,

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is sort
of a pure empty field.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:84%
What we experience
within that field,

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
the objects of consciousness,
are conditioned certainly

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:90%
by our biological system.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, consciousness--
there's pure consciousness,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:18.530 align:middle line:10%
which is consciousness
before it takes on form.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:10%
And an analogy I often
think of for that

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.550 align:middle line:10%
is like if you've
got a film projector,

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:10%
you've got white
light behind the film.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:10%
That is like the
pure light, which

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:10%
is the same for every
single film projector.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:84%
That light shines through
the film onto the screen,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and it takes on the
colors of the film,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and you get a particular
image forming.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
But you'd have to take the
film out completely just

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:40.745 align:middle line:90%
to see the white light.

00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the
same with consciousness.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.600 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness, my
consciousness right

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
now is taking on all these
forms I'm experiencing

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.160 align:middle line:84%
of you and the studio and also
the thoughts and feelings that

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:90%
are inside me.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:90%
It's taking on all these forms.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.500 align:middle line:10%
But if I were to stop
and become very quiet

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:10%
and go into a deep
state of meditation

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.300 align:middle line:10%
so that the mind becomes
still and I'm not experiencing

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:10%
the world anymore, then you
can come back to a state

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:10%
where you are just that
pure light of consciousness

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.870 align:middle line:10%
before it takes on all
these multitudinous forms.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, Peter, that
you mentioned the pure light

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:16.220 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:84%
When we come back for part
2 of this two-part series,

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about the
meaning of light itself

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and the relationship
between consciousness

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:90%
and physical light.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
I know you have a lot to
say about that as well.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.530 align:middle line:90%
I think they're very parallel.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
no accident we use

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.370 align:middle line:90%
the word light in both cases.

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Peter Russell, it's
been a pleasure having this

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:84%
discussion with you on the
mystery of consciousness.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep problem, and
it's very heartening to me

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
that people such as yourself
are coming forward and bringing

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.150 align:middle line:84%
these problems up to the
surface and encouraging people

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:90%
to explore them.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being with me.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.
