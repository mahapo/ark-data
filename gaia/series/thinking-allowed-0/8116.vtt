00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Our topic today is finding
wisdom on the spiritual path.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr.
Jack Kornfield, who

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.050 align:middle line:10%
is a founder of the
Insight Meditation Society

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.350 align:middle line:10%
and a founder of the Spirit
Rock Meditation Center

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:10%
in Marin County, California.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
He's author of several books,
including "A Path with a Heart"

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:90%
and "After the Ecstasy--

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.440 align:middle line:90%
The Laundry."

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Jack.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.242 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure to be with--

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Happy to be here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people who pursue
a spiritual path are drawn

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of enlightenment,
how wonderful to be

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:90%
an enlightened person.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And we sort of have
a myth about it,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:84%
a fairy tale myth as if
once you're enlightened,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:84%
then you live
happily ever after.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.830 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you show
that that really is a myth,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and you point out that all of
the great teachers who you've

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.070 align:middle line:84%
had the privilege
of working with

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
seem to have many normal
human problems in their lives

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
even after they've achieved
states of enlightenment.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, enlightenment in
one way is a transformation

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.500 align:middle line:10%
of the heart, but it's not
necessarily a transformation

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:10%
of the body or even perhaps
so much of the personality,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.705 align:middle line:10%
so that you become awake,
compassionate, loving, caring,

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:10%
but it doesn't mean you still
don't have the conditioning

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:10%
and experiences of your
culture and your time.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.160 align:middle line:84%
Zen master Suzuki Roshi
put it quite nicely,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
he said, what we're
after is enlightenment

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:90%
one moment after another.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
To actually live it and
embody it is the task

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
and not to have
some imaginary state

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
that we hold our breath
about and say, now I have it,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
and not realize that
life itself is a flow,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and to be really
enlightened is to be

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
able to flow with the changes
of the seasons of life.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You imply that that's an
impossible ideal in your book.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I actually don't try to
say either way what happens,

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
because that would be
presumptuous to speak about

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.180 align:middle line:90%
someone else.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
What I've discovered is that
for the longtime practitioners

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and teachers that I've
spoken with, many of them,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
they discover that there's
always new learning and things

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to deepen their patience,
their compassion, their love.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.420 align:middle line:84%
So rather than seeing
it as a fixed goal,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
it becomes the
journey of awakening.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it's been
for most Western students

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.140 align:middle line:90%
and teachers.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of it, from
reading your book,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
as sort of like
being on a tightrope.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
There is this point
of perfect balance

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and it's ecstatic
when it's achieved,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.450 align:middle line:84%
but you can't live your
whole life up there.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
beautiful image.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
In a way, whether it's a
tightrope or a bicycle,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
you're never actually
in the center.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
On the bicycle you're always
moving back and forth,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
staying near the
center in some way.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And inwardly in the heart,
there is a real possibility

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.510 align:middle line:84%
of freedom no matter what the
circumstances, but sometimes

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.120 align:middle line:84%
a new circumstance or
difficulty will come even

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.763 align:middle line:84%
for someone very
wise, and they'll

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
have to adjust and
say, all right,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
how do I be with this
in a way that's truly

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:90%
compassionate and truly free?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:84%
In your book,
"After the Ecstasy--

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:84%
The Laundry," it's
a wonderful book

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's very rich in terms
of the kinds of human problems

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:84%
people work through,
but I guess I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
was drawn to many of the stories
about great spiritual teachers

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
who had a shadow side to them,
that they had it worked out,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and many of their own
students were unaware of that,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes painful
experiences resulted because

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.279 align:middle line:84%
of abuses in the
spiritual context.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The wisest of the
spiritual teachers,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
the ones that I've most
admiration for, like his

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
holiness the Dalai Lama or
Zen master Suzuki Roshi,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.490 align:middle line:90%
they have a humility about them.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama will say yes,
sometimes I will still even get

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:84%
angry a little bit,
but then I realize,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.330 align:middle line:90%
what is the use with that?

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.752 align:middle line:84%
And I let it go, or Zen master
Suzuki Roshi talked about--

00:04:41.752 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:84%
his wife said, actually,
he wasn't enlightened,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:90%
she kind of was teasing him.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.340 align:middle line:84%
He said maybe not,
but I have really

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
learned to live this great
practice, this enlightenment

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:90%
from one moment after another.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
If somebody sets up an ideal
in their own mind of how

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
a person is supposed
to be, then often

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
they don't want to look at the
difficulties of their lives.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:84%
But the wisest teachers have
more humility than that,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and they say, well, here's
another opportunity to learn,

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
or here's the place to
deepen this compassion.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a more
helpful attitude to almost all

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.810 align:middle line:84%
of us who undertake
a spiritual practice.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.940 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
awakening and enlightenment

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:90%
is impossible.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.610 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that we have
to embody it and live it day

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:84%
by day in our relations,
in our community,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
even in relation
to our own body.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And life always seems to
have a way of challenging us

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:90%
at our edges.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly so.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:84%
It's also true that most people
find that their spiritual life

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
will develop one area before
another, just like there can

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.500 align:middle line:84%
be a great Olympic athlete
who's emotionally maybe not

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
so developed inside, or a
university professor who's

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
brilliant intellectually, but
maybe has forgotten their body.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a line from James
Joyce where he wrote, Mr.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Duffy lived a short distance
from his body of one character.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And part of meditation
in spiritual life

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
is to come and respect
this human body

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
that we've been given.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is to learn
the nature of the mind.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is to learn what
the Buddha called right speech,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
right action, right
relationships with others.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:10%
>> At the same time, the
spiritual cultures that we

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:10%
have-- for example, Buddhism,
which is several thousands

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:10%
of years old, have like all
cultural systems formed certain

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.420 align:middle line:10%
patterns and maybe become
rigid in certain ways.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
You point out, for example,
in some traditions,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
it's simply not acceptable
to talk about your problems

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
or to focus on perhaps
ailments of the body.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly so.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And in cultures where I
lived and loved my experience

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:10%
in Asia, in Burma or
Thailand or India or Japan,

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:10%
there are culturally things
that it's proper to talk about

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.110 align:middle line:10%
and some that are kept private.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
But whether private or not,
if we're to be really free,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn to
be as free in our care

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
for this physical body as
we are free in our thoughts

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.970 align:middle line:90%
or in the mind.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered
in interviewing

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
teachers and masters is
that they would find,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
as they matured
in spiritual life,

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
places that they were
still frightened,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is still unconscious,
and those became

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
the base of their practice.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:84%
One beautiful nun who
had been a Tibetan nun

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.260 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years had
ecstatic meditations,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:84%
then she got cancer,
and she realized

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that she had used her body
but not loved or inhabited it

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:90%
in a wise or healing way.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I had to
change my spiritual life

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to include this physical
body in the same way

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had included the
ecstasies of the meditation.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you yourself have
gone through some interesting

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.970 align:middle line:90%
transitions on your path.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:10%
At one time you were
a monk in a monastery.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.720 align:middle line:10%
>> That's correct, and it was
one of the most both beautiful

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.240 align:middle line:10%
and inspiring times of
my life to spend years

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:10%
in the monastery.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Then something
inside in my own life

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:84%
felt I needed to come
back to the West.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I was very much drawn
to marriage and family

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and relationship, and I
asked my teacher about it,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and he said, in marriage
and family and relationship,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
you will also find
plenty of opportunity

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
to practice patience,
to practice compassion,

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to understand the wisdom of
letting go and generosity

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.630 align:middle line:90%
just as you do in the monastery.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So don't stop your
practice or think

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:90%
that it's low class practice.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:90%
That, too, is a place to awaken.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And along the way you
learned some lessons perhaps

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.330 align:middle line:90%
you hadn't expected.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think that we all do.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly learned
lessons in parenting.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.430 align:middle line:84%
In the monastery, if they
ring the bell at 3:00

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
in the morning to get up
and meditate and chant

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
as they used to do, if
you're really tired,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.620 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of roll over
and say, well maybe tomorrow.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But when your child
wakes up in the middle

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.780 align:middle line:84%
of the night sick and
crying, this little baby,

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:90%
you have no choice.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
You get up and you tend
to this sick child.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a level
of surrender and openness

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that was required in parenting
or in being a partner

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and being a husband that
was in some ways more

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
demanding and equally inspiring
as being in the monastery.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:90%
And frankly equally difficult.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.860 align:middle line:10%
There's a very poignant
story in your book

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:10%
about the clash you
had with your wife

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.880 align:middle line:10%
having to do with the concept
of goddesses in every woman.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:10%
Well, you know how
when we start to have

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:10%
a relationship-- and this
was early in my marriage

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:10%
after the first year or so.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:10%
I was still hoping my
wife, who is naturally

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:10%
a kind of introverted and
quiet person and artist

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:10%
and a very deep
spiritual being, I

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:10%
was hoping that she would
become more like me,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.428 align:middle line:10%
more extroverted and more
social and things like that.

00:10:08.428 --> 00:10:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in
the back of my mind,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.595 align:middle line:84%
even though I wasn't
thinking about it,

00:10:11.595 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:84%
my hope was that
she would change,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
even though we're
drawn to our opposites,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:90%
I was going to change her.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And then one day we were
walking in the Zen Center,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
and she'd had me read a book
about various goddesses,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.180 align:middle line:84%
and I said, well I could
relate to Aphrodite,

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
she's this very
wonderful goddess,

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.910 align:middle line:84%
and Athena, the
goddess of wisdom,

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.280 align:middle line:84%
the goddess of Aphrodite,
of beauty and so forth.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:90%
Hestia I'm not sure about.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.187 align:middle line:84%
She's sort of the hearth
and home, the invisible one.

00:10:37.187 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And my wife looked at me and
she said, what do you mean?

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
I knew you'd never loved me!

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And she took the
book out of my hand

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and threw it down
and went off crying,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and I actually felt
very bad, because I

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:84%
realized in some unconscious
way, early in the marriage

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:90%
I was still--

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I loved her, but I was still
hoping she'd change and be more

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:90%
the way I wanted her to be.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And in that moment,
I realized the truth

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
of relationship, that we have
to love each other as we are.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that's the only
thing that frees the heart,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
is to see us--

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
each of us in our
uniqueness and to discover

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.170 align:middle line:84%
what the Buddha
called the great heart

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:84%
of compassion, the great
heart of loving kindness.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that you can't
speak out against difficulty

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.020 align:middle line:84%
or injustice or accommodate
for another person,

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.750 align:middle line:84%
but true love isn't about
attachment or having someone

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
be different any more
than true meditation is

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.550 align:middle line:90%
about grasping and struggling.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
It's really opening to
see the way things are

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.640 align:middle line:84%
and bringing that great
compassion to the circumstance.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Jack, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Dr. Jack
Kornfield about wisdom

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:90%
on the spiritual path.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Jack, in your book,
"After the Ecstasy--

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.720 align:middle line:84%
The Laundry," you
refer to a time

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:84%
in which you convened a group
of Buddhist spiritual teachers

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.720 align:middle line:84%
from many different
Buddhist traditions.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.603 align:middle line:10%
>> And from all over the--

00:12:12.603 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:10%
>> We've had a series of
meetings this last year.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:10%
We had 220 Buddhist teachers
from around the world

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.010 align:middle line:10%
together with the Dalai Lama
and other great Zen masters

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.425 align:middle line:10%
and so forth at our center
in Spirit Rock in California.

00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And it was a beautiful
gathering because there's so

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.370 align:middle line:10%
many different expressions
and voices, some

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:10%
who represent a kind
of spacious emptiness,

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.670 align:middle line:10%
others who were very much
spiritual activists who

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:10%
want to take the
wisdom of the Buddha

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:10%
and work for the environment
to save the rainforests.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it was beautiful
to hear the different ways

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.092 align:middle line:84%
that the inner spiritual
life expressed itself

00:12:51.092 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:90%
through these teachers.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think it must be
awesome when you consider

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
a community like that,
thousands of years

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.700 align:middle line:84%
old, doing good work for so
long and in so many places.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It was very beautiful
to get people together.

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts
was to see that since it

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
was more Western teachers
than Asian teachers

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:84%
here in the West, that there
were as many women teachers

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.850 align:middle line:84%
as men, which is a shift
in the way Buddhism--

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist wisdom is being carried
in this culture, and quite

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:90%
a beautiful one.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama was really happy
and celebratory about that,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
as were some of the
other of the wise elders.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.960 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't be as easily
possible in Tibet or Burma yet,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.360 align:middle line:84%
those cultures are
very slowly changing.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But here in America,
there's no way to stop it,

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:84%
and it's one of the
most beautiful things

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:51.240 align:middle line:84%
to see a whole group of very
wise and impressive teachings

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.607 align:middle line:84%
and teachers come from the
women who've been practicing

00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:90%
for all these years.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet you
described a moment--

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:84%
it touched me--
when the Dalai Lama

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:84%
himself was moved to tears
listening to the pain

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that some of these
women described

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and being recognized and
accepted as Buddhist teachers.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, especially there was
one woman who told a story about

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.960 align:middle line:84%
how hard it was for Tibetan
women and for herself

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.175 align:middle line:84%
as a Western Tibetan nun,
but it's also true in Burma

00:14:19.175 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:90%
or Thailand and places.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And she's talked
about the longing

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
that the women she was
with had to have teachings

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and to realize their
own Buddha nature,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and how much struggle it was,
how little support they got.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama put his
head in his hands and he wept.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I didn't realize
it was this difficult.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I will do everything
I can to help

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.330 align:middle line:84%
facilitate the
access to teachings

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and support for women.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:44.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:44.958 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things
that we talked about in that

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
meeting, the
question was raised,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
what is different in Western
culture for Buddhist teachers?

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And we talked a
lot about how there

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of self-judgment
and unworthiness

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%
that is endemic to our culture.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama
said, could we explain?

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:90%
We talked about self-hatred.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.530 align:middle line:90%
And he said, self-hatred?

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
He had to have it
translated three times.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, we don't have
that in Tibetan culture.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.102 align:middle line:84%
What-- you mean people
really hate themselves?

00:15:18.102 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
how many people

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
will come to a spiritual
path bearing the wounds

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
or the difficulties of
their life or the judgments

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
that they've placed
on themselves,

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and how little mercy people
have for themselves not

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.210 align:middle line:90%
to speak of one another.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So that the whole way
we've been practicing

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.660 align:middle line:84%
has needed to be shifted to
be grounded in loving kindness

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:90%
and compassion first.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Before we even look at what
is the nature of the mind,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn to
be kind to ourselves.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not kind to
yourself or those around you,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.810 align:middle line:84%
you can't even begin
to look honestly.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.110 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very revealing
and helpful conversation.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it strikes me
that here in the West,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
we have a tradition
of psychotherapy.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:10%
You yourself are educated
as a psychotherapist,

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:10%
and my experience in
traveling in Asia--

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:10%
big cities like Hong
Kong, psychotherapy

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:10%
is still almost unknown.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.150 align:middle line:10%
The kind of therapy, if
you will, that's offered

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:10%
is through Buddhist
practice and so forth.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:10%
And there's a very
wonderful dimension.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:10%
One can train oneself in loving
kindness and forgiveness that

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:10%
are deeply therapeutic.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And on a meditation
retreat, you can really

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.450 align:middle line:90%
do a great deal of healing.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
The gift that
psychotherapy has brought

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is to put two people
together that allows someone

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
to ask you the questions that
take you even deeper that you

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:84%
might shy away from in your own
meditation that might be too

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.420 align:middle line:84%
difficult. So the
Buddhist principles

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of forgiveness or compassion
are very much compatible

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.070 align:middle line:84%
with Western psychotherapy,
and there is a real interest

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:54.530 align:middle line:84%
even among Buddhist
teachers into how

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to borrow what's a value from
the Western tradition that's

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
compatible with the fundamental
understanding of liberation,

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder, though, in
Asian countries, like Tibet,

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.720 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
self-hatred is--

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.150 align:middle line:84%
it's expressed in
the West might also

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
be their people might
come from families where

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
as children they've
been mistreated,

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have a
culture of talking about it

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.690 align:middle line:84%
or thinking about
it the way we do.

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of that might be true,
but there's another side.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go and look in a
Tibetan refugee village where

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.250 align:middle line:84%
they've lost their country,
their religion and culture have

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.980 align:middle line:84%
been destroyed by
the Communist army

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
and so forth there, they've
lost their economic base,

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the children are so
beautiful and so happy,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
because it's a
culture that still

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
has the wisdom of
holding the children

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and caring for them-- they're
not being raised by television

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
and daycare and
the kind of things

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
where we don't
tend to the growing

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.520 align:middle line:90%
spirit of our young ones.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
So that there really is less
unhappiness in some ways

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
among the children
in those cultures

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.990 align:middle line:84%
because they still
carry the old wisdom.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's something that I
think we need to bring back

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:84%
in not just to bring people
to meditation to find this

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
awakening themselves, but
to start when we're young

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and remind that we can raise
our children in a more beautiful

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:90%
and organic way.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, Buddhism I find especially
interesting because it

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.710 align:middle line:10%
has withstood so many tests
over the thousands of years,

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.570 align:middle line:10%
and in so many
different cultures

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:10%
it has adapted and found--

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:10%
built true authentic
community it seems to me.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the context
of community, I

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
guess there is this opportunity
to integrate and to be

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
critical of various problems
that come along where it seems,

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:84%
in a sense and in the West,
this idea of spiritual community

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.270 align:middle line:90%
is sort of a new thing.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure if
it's new or not.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It's central to Christian
and Jewish belief,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
although it may not
be practiced always.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly
central in Buddhism.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:90%
We need one another.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We are not independent,
but we're interdependent.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:84%
And whether it's the environment
or the care for our children

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and their care for
our cities, the sense

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.110 align:middle line:84%
of attending
spiritually is critical.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The whole vision of
a Western society

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:90%
where everyone is independent--

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.910 align:middle line:84%
one person in a car has
now crowded our roadways,

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and everybody getting their gas
is now ruining the atmosphere,

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.020 align:middle line:84%
the transformation that's
needed from the Buddhist

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.700 align:middle line:84%
teachings' perspective--
but really,

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:90%
from any place of wisdom--

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we look at each
other as part of a whole.

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is central
to Buddhist wisdom.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.580 align:middle line:10%
The other thing that
central is reminding people

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:10%
that it's possible for
their heart to be free

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:10%
no matter how difficult
their circumstances.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So I had a Cambodian teacher
after the great tragedies

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:10%
in Cambodia who walked on
foot through all the war

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:10%
zones teaching people loving
kindness and forgiveness

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.090 align:middle line:10%
and saying that without
forgiveness, our hearts can

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.050 align:middle line:10%
never be free.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:10%
And he was-- they
tried to shoot him

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:10%
and they were hand
grenades rolled out

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.632 align:middle line:10%
to his walking, a group
of monks and so forth,

00:20:22.632 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:10%
But they walked anyway.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.590 align:middle line:84%
He said, if we don't
learn forgiveness,

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
what good is it to
be on this Earth?

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So there is a transformation of
the heart that any human being

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
can find our Buddha nature,
our true nature even

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:90%
in times of difficulty.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:10%
>> What we have in the
West-- why I use that phrase,

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.800 align:middle line:10%
that spiritual community
seems like a new thing to us,

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.840 align:middle line:10%
obviously we have
ancient religions,

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:10%
but it seems in our culture
that there's-- people do make

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:10%
a distinction, that they find
it a valid distinction between

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:10%
religion and spirituality.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Religion, you could say,
is the organized outer form.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality, at
least in my language,

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
means the awakening of
an individual's heart.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And religion provides vehicles,
but it doesn't have the spirit

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.160 align:middle line:84%
unless the spirit
comes into a person

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.480 align:middle line:90%
or into a group of people.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.820 align:middle line:10%
So whether it's an
individual or a group,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:10%
the idea is really to become
a Buddha and not a Buddhist.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.750 align:middle line:10%
The idea is to discover--

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:10%
to shift from the
small sense of self,

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.510 align:middle line:10%
what we call the body
of fear, and to awaken

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:10%
the natural generosity and
compassion and goodness

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:10%
that we're born with that
may have been covered over

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:10%
to use meditation or whatever
tools there are of service

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:10%
and so forth to bring
us back in touch

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.790 align:middle line:10%
with that love that is our
original or our Buddha nature.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
One might say in a
Christian context,

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
the ideal would
then be to become

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:90%
Christ rather than a Christian.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Or to follow what
Christ did and what

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
he taught rather than saying,
this is to be a Christian

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and those people aren't,
to love your neighbor,

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
to turn the other cheek,
to care for the poor.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:08.715 align:middle line:90%
That's a true Christian.

00:22:08.715 --> 00:22:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:90%
And in the--

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And a true Buddhist.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
In the process of doing
those difficult tasks,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.450 align:middle line:84%
we always run up against, I
guess, our own inequalities

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:19.800 align:middle line:90%
that we bring to it.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and that's the
place of transformation.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And one of the beautiful
things in Buddhist teaching

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is that the meditations of
forgiveness or of compassion

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
that one does over and over,
the meditations of awareness

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we see the
fears and the confusions

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and discover how to
step outside of them.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
systematic trainings

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that help us in
those difficulties

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.160 align:middle line:84%
so that we can really
learn to be free.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
We can trust, we can rest
in that awakened heart.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Jack Kornfield,
what a pleasure it

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is sharing these aspects
of the path with you.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:54.512 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:22:54.512 --> 00:22:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a pleasure
for me, too, thank you.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a pleasure.
