00:00:02.976 --> 00:00:16.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Our topic today is
hallucinogens and culture.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
We're going to examine the
way that various cultures

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.170 align:middle line:10%
throughout the planet
have been influenced

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
in their social and cultural
and intellectual development

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.980 align:middle line:10%
by hallucinogenic substances
in the food chain.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:84%
With me in the studio
is Terrence McKenna,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
author, lecturer,
explorer, and philosopher.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Terrence is the co-author
with his brother

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
Dennis McKenna of a book called
"The Invisible Landscape, Mind,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Hallucinogens, and the I Ching."

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:84%
He's also the co-author of
"Psilocybin, Magic Mushroom

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Growers Guide."

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of a computer
program called "Time Wave

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Zero," and he's the
co-founder and president

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
of an organization called
Botanical Dimensions, which

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
devotes itself to saving
botanical plants used

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
in shamanistic traditions
throughout the world.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Terrence.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I think a good starting
point for our discussion

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
would be the ancient
vedic culture of India,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.700 align:middle line:84%
one of the world's great and
one of the world's earliest

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
religions, the rigveda, is
considered by all scholars,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, to be one of the
most beautiful composite

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
of religious hymns and deep
philosophical discussions.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet when one reads
the rigveda carefully,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
one discovers an
enormous emphasis

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320 align:middle line:84%
on a mysterious apparently
hallucinogenic substance

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.850 align:middle line:90%
called soma.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, you're quite right.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.440 align:middle line:10%
The ninth mandala
of the rigveda is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:10%
entirely devoted to singing
the praises of soma.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:10%
And yet we do not know
what soma is or was.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
R Gordon Wasson spent
a considerable portion

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
of his life researching
this problem

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:84%
and reached the
conclusion that soma

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
was amanita muscaria,
a mushroom that

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
is symbiotic to pine and
birch trees throughout much

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:90%
of the North temperate zone.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
However, scholars
have cast doubt

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.690 align:middle line:90%
on his identification of soma.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, what we learn
from Wasson's scholarship

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
is that plants with
hallucinogenic chemical

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.170 align:middle line:84%
principles in them have
had an enormous impact

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.800 align:middle line:84%
on shaping the psychology
of various cultures,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
both pre-literate and
literate, throughout the world.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems quite clear
that the references to soma

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and the rigveda were
not really symbolic.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
They refer to some
actual plant substance.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Some sort of plant substance
was prepared and ingested

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:84%
by a priesthood, who then used
the ecstatic experience induced

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
by that plant as
the basis for all

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.000 align:middle line:84%
of their metaphysical and
philosophical speculations

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%
on the nature of the universe.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:84%
The case of soma is
by no means unique.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:84%
My own field of interest
was the Amazon basin

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.650 align:middle line:84%
where we don't have a
great written literature,

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
but we do have an extensive
oral tradition and a tradition

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
of hallucinogenic plant use that
persists to the present day.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think most notable
in South America is the drug

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca is perhaps the world's
largest and most thriving

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic religion.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It touches the lives of
millions of mestizos and Indians

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.210 align:middle line:90%
in the basin.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
it is a combinatory drug,
which makes it especially

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
interesting to pharmacologists,
because its two principal

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:84%
ingredients are,
themselves, inactive,

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.480 align:middle line:84%
except in the presence
of each other.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
So what we have in
the case of ayahuasca

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.660 align:middle line:84%
is an example of a highly
evolved folk pharmacology.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And how a discovery
like this was ever

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.160 align:middle line:84%
made in the first place is one
of the challenging questions

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that anthropologists
have to deal with.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
After all, in a square mile
of Amazonian rainforest

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
it is not unusual to encounter
50,000 distinct species

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:90%
of plants.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.880 align:middle line:84%
How, then, did these so-called
primitive or pre-literate

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
people make the connection
between the combining

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:84%
of the bark of one with the
leaves of another, boiled

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and put through a
number of procedures

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to produce an intense
visionary hallucinogen?

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
This is an extremely
interesting and to this day

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.595 align:middle line:90%
unanswered question.

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Isn't it the case that--

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was the German
chemist who isolated this--

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
the chemical active
ingredient in ayahuasca,

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.050 align:middle line:90%
originally named it telepathine.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Based on field reports of the
states of group mind induced

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
by ayahuasca, which
is also called yagÃ©,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
he felt it was fitting
to name it telepathine.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, the rules of
scientific nomenclature

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
are such that the first
name of the compound

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:90%
is always given precedent.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And about 20 years after
it was named telepathine,

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.860 align:middle line:84%
it was realized that the
identical compound had

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.460 align:middle line:84%
been isolated around
the turn of the century

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.830 align:middle line:84%
from the giant Syrian
rue, Peganum harmala,

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:90%
and named harmine.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So today the active
ingredients of ayahuasca

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
are known as harmine,
harmaline, and tetrahydroharman.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
But your point is well taken.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The-- what struck the early
explorers and ethnographers

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:84%
into the Amazon basin was the
fact that the people seemed

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:84%
to be taking this plant
preparation in order to under--

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
undergo states of
community group mindedness.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And during these
intoxicating intervals,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:84%
social plans relative to
migration, hunting, and warfare

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
were undertaken by the
elders of the tribe.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And though the name
has been changed

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
to be more innocuous
harmine, nevertheless, there

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
is a continued
persistence of the feeling

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.500 align:middle line:84%
that telepathic and
group mind states

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.700 align:middle line:84%
are induced by this
particular plant mixture.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's particularly
interesting in the light

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
of the fact that the chemical
constituents, which make it go,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
are, in fact, found
endogenously in the human brain.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
These are not exotic
compounds from the point

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.900 align:middle line:84%
of view of ordinary
human brain chemistry.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
So there is a suggestion
there that manipulation

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:84%
of neural humoral compounds,
brain neurotransmitters,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
and that sort of
thing may, in fact,

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.545 align:middle line:84%
open the door to untapped
areas of human potential.

00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I would imagine that many of
our viewers have seen the movie

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
"The Emerald Forest," which
seems to deal with the use

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of substances of this sort
in the Amazon culture.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.960 align:middle line:10%
John Boorman did a wonderful
job with that movie.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.270 align:middle line:10%
He was portraying the
use of epena, snuff.

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.910 align:middle line:84%
That's a hallucinogenic
drug complex

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
that occurs in the eastern
part of the Amazon drainage

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:90%
and in rural Venezuela.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Epena contains DMT and
is blown up the nostrils

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.040 align:middle line:84%
by a co-operative friend,
and induces an intense state

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.390 align:middle line:90%
of hallucinogenesis.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that was, I think,
most people's first exposure

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
to the real richness of the
visionary pharmacopoeia that

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
does exist in the Amazon.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's also the
suggestion there then, I guess,

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
that DMT would trigger
telepathic-like experiences

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.960 align:middle line:84%
or clairvoyant types
of experiences.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And DMT is also a product of
endogenous human metabolism.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that the most
intense of the hallucinogens,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.190 align:middle line:84%
DMT, which you mentioned,
are the ones which

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.330 align:middle line:84%
are most closely related
to our own brain chemistry.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:84%
So far from these compounds
being alien to the brain

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
or being an insult to the
physical brain, what they

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
really represent
are the shifting

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:84%
of ratios of compounds already
present in the ordinary brain.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, DMT I believe
is dimethyltryptophan

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Triptamine.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Triptamine.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Triptamine.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:10%
It's related to the protein
tryptophan, is it not?

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.920 align:middle line:10%
>> It's related to the
protein tryptophan.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.630 align:middle line:90%
It's also related to serotonin.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter
which occurs in all life

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and is most concentrated
in the higher primates

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and most concentrated
there in man.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.380 align:middle line:90%
It is 5-hydroxytriptamine.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:84%
While DMT is, as you mentioned,
NN dimethyltriptamine.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So there is a very close
structural affinity

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.730 align:middle line:84%
between this extremely potent
and exotic hallucinogen

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
and the very common basis
for ordinary consciousness,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
serotonin.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Now other cultures around
the world have also used other

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:90%
types of substances.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it might be interesting
to talk, at least briefly,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
about alcohol, which is referred
to so often in the Bible,

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.900 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Well we tend in our culture
to make a radical distinction

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.740 align:middle line:84%
between drugs and
foods with what

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we call spices sort of falling
somewhere in the middle.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
In point of fact, a
culture is what it eats,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and an individual's
personality is often largely

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.610 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of their diet.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:84%
There has not been
a human culture

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that did not bear upon it
the stamp of its relationship

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
to certain plants which altered
the individual and mass psyche.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
We can think of
numerous examples.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The influence, for instance,
of sugar on the growth

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
of 19th century mercantilism.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Or the way in which
the British manipulated

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
opium policy in the Far East.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.830 align:middle line:84%
Or, as you mentioned,
alcohol, which

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
has always been the drug of
choice in Western culture.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Who can imagine modern
industrial office culture

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:90%
without coffee?

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
These are major
drug dependencies

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that have placed their stamp
on the lives of millions

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%
and millions of people.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that we choose
to linguistically define it

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that the
effect is not something

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:90%
most people are cognizant of.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I think coffee is a
very interesting example,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
because when it was first
introduced into our culture,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
as I understand, it was
considered a virtually

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.130 align:middle line:90%
a hallucinogenic drug.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:84%
When coffee was first
introduced into Western culture,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.430 align:middle line:84%
it was associated with
certain establishments

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:84%
where loose women and
loud music were available.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And the bohemian literati
would gather and drink coffee

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.290 align:middle line:90%
and talk into the night.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And it was considered
quite a risque thing

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:90%
to be involved with.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.760 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And wasn't tobacco also
viewed that way initially?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, tobacco is
a very similar case.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The anthropologist Eduardo
Luna has pointed out

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:84%
that tobacco, which had a
history of millennia of use

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:90%
in the new world, was--

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:84%
within 100 years of being
introduced into Europe

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
through Portugal was
being buried in the graves

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
of subarctic Lapland shamans.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So it shows how the
character of a drug

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
is quickly discerned by a
culture, even a culture that

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
is encountering that plant or
that drug for the first time.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It wouldn't be fair really
to talk about drugs without

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.050 align:middle line:84%
mentioning socially what has
happened in Western culture,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
particularly during the '60s and
early '70s when there was quite

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:90%
a wave of psychedelic drug use.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:10%
Following upon the
discovery of LSD

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.910 align:middle line:10%
by Albert Hoffman in
the late '30s, and then

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.510 align:middle line:10%
the writing on the subject
of the psychedelic experience

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:10%
that was done by Aldous
Huxley, Metzner, and others,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:10%
it became a fad of the
self-exploring youth

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:10%
culture of the '60s to be
involved with these things.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
This was during a time
of great social upheaval

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
for other reasons,
and the end product

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of that historical episode
was the complete suppression

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
of the study of
psychedelic drugs.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, to the great
detriment of the development

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.610 align:middle line:90%
of psychology.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I feel that potentially
psychedelic drugs

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
could be for psychology
what the telescope became

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
for the science of astronomy.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
The problem with
the psychedelics

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:84%
is that they dissolve
cultural programming

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and hence inherently have a
political charge about them.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
You see, culture is the product
of the unperturbed human mind.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
The human mind unperturbed
through the medium of language

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
erects institutions
and social structures

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
into which it then
secretes itself and lives

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.510 align:middle line:90%
in a private Idaho.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.560 align:middle line:84%
A psychedelic drug will dissolve
these linguistic and cultural

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:90%
assumptions.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:84%
It is a perturbation
of the mind,

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and the perturbed mind
is a mind in the act

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.440 align:middle line:84%
of rediscovering the nature
that lies outside of culture.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.650 align:middle line:84%
So this tension between cultural
values and what we might call,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
for want of a
better word, reality

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
creates a tension
between institutions

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:90%
and the users of the substances.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It's as if our culture,
if I understand you right,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:47.000 align:middle line:10%
acts as a filter between our
minds and direct experience

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.290 align:middle line:10%
of reality.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And the drugs somehow blow
away that crust of culture

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and allow more of a
direct nastic experience.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And the business of
culture, any culture,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
is to perpetuate
its cultural models.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And if the hallucinogenic
plants have not

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
been integrated into
the cultural model,

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.520 align:middle line:84%
then they are definitely
seen as dangerous forces

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:84%
for an unpredictable
sort of social change.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Now if the hallucinogenic
plants have

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
been integrated into
the cultural model,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:90%
this is not then a problem.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
case with shamanism.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Shamanism is the culturally
sanctified institution

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
of inner exploration
via psychoactive plants.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Where psychoactive
plants are not present,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:84%
shamanic institutions
tend to become

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:55.940 align:middle line:84%
vitiated to rely on ritual
or ordeals or other methods

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
of eluciding-- eliciting
these ecstatic states.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:84%
But to my mind, and this
is a great argument which

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
rages in anthropology,
to my mind,

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm in agreement
with Wasson here,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.660 align:middle line:84%
the hallucinogenic plants
are the sine qua non

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.180 align:middle line:90%
for an active shamanism.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.109 align:middle line:90%
>> For authentic?

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> An authentic shamanism.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.300 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Now Mircea Eliade, who is the
great commentator on shamanism,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
took an entirely
different point of view

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:33.890 align:middle line:84%
and said that reliance on
what he called narcotics was

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.350 align:middle line:90%
a decadent phase of shamanism.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But if we examine
Eliade's personal history,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I think it can be clearly
seen that this was simply

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the cultural myopia
of a European scholar

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:90%
in the great 19th century model.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of still under the
sway of a Victorian sense

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
of morality.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Taking the point of the
superior point of view

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that while these are
primitive people,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
surely our greater
epistemological sophistication

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.957 align:middle line:84%
puts us in a position
to judge them.

00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You have the same
controversy, don't you,

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:16.790 align:middle line:84%
now within the Hindu tradition
where we're many gurus say no

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
drugs and are
denying, I suppose,

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:84%
the tradition of the rigveda,
which we spoke of earlier.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.810 align:middle line:90%
>> That's absolutely correct.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The Mahabharata, which
is the central core

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
text of late reformed Hinduism,
explicitly forbids mushrooms

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:90%
to the Brahman class.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:90%
They are a forbidden food.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:84%
But in ethnography we're
taught that a taboo usually

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
indicates a previous
involvement and fascination.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:57.260 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, the early
Hinduism of the vedic phase

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
was definitely more analogous
to the hallucinogenic shamanism

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
of the Amazon basin than it
is to the extremely stratified

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:90%
Hinduism of modern India.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you find the use
of drugs of this type,

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
hallucinogenic drugs in
the tantric traditions,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:84%
the traditions that
deliberately use taboos in order

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
to inculcate higher
states of awareness?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go to
India, you discover

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.640 align:middle line:84%
that the one thing that is
not stressed in Hinduism as it

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:36.160 align:middle line:84%
is exported to the West is the
immense reliance on cannabis,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
hashish, ganja, is the
staple of these Sadus.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.310 align:middle line:84%
This is a fact of
their daily life

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
that they are relying
on this for a constantly

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:54.250 align:middle line:84%
reinforced contact with the
transcendental dimension.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:19:55.173 --> 00:19:56.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
it's interesting

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.000 align:middle line:84%
how you referred earlier to
the shamanistic religions

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.880 align:middle line:84%
as being the ones that
really have sanctified

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
the use of these drugs
for religious purposes.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we find in
our Western tradition,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Christianity has
come and in an effect

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.460 align:middle line:84%
labeled these sorts
of things as diabolic.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, drugs,
I believe, were

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.280 align:middle line:84%
used amongst various
witchcraft groups that

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.410 align:middle line:90%
were persecuted by the church.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
However, the church
was concerned

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that the magic of
the witches be seen

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
as real, number
one, and number two,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
entirely caused by the
agency of the devil himself.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And so the church downplayed
the operational role

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
that plants had in
inducing these states.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, if the devil
cannot lead you astray without

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.490 align:middle line:84%
the use of plants, why,
what kind of devil is it?

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So in our own
historical tradition

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.540 align:middle line:84%
there is a curious
blindness to the efficacy

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of hallucinogenic plants.

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I have heard, for example,
that in the old story

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:84%
of witches using toad
skins in their brews,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that there is a drug
called bufotenine,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
which is a hallucinogenic that
comes from the skin of toads.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there was excitement
about bufotenine in the mid

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:10%
'60s.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:10%
It was later shown to
be non-psychoactive.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:84%
However, since then toads
have been found which

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:90%
do secrete DMT-like compounds.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's fairly clear that
the cauldron chemistry

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of the witches, which relied on
datura, hellebore, monkshood,

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:84%
henbane, these sorts of plants,
was a powerful visionary

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.250 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Although these compounds,
the tropane alkaloids that

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:84%
occur in those plants,
tend to be more deliriants

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and confusants than what I
call the classical psychedelic

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.670 align:middle line:84%
compounds, which are more
the triptamines and the beta

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%
carbolines.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
There are many chemical
compounds in nature

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
which are psychoactive, but
a much narrower spectrum

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
of these compounds
are truly what

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:84%
we call psychedelic
or mind-manifesting.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.480 align:middle line:10%
Now other than the obvious
spiritual and religious

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:10%
implications, which
we see again and again

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:10%
in different cultures, even,
I suppose we should mention,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:10%
the Native American
church and their use of--

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Peyote.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:10%
>> --peyote.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.980 align:middle line:84%
What are the other kinds
of cultural developments

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that we can trace to
the use of these drugs?

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the most
profound cultural development

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
is it is possible to make the
case that language itself is

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:02.230 align:middle line:84%
an ability that was coaxed out
of an evolving primate species

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
by virtue of the fact that
there were hallucinogenic plants

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.060 align:middle line:90%
in the diet of that creature.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.750 align:middle line:84%
You see, psilocybin has
been shown in low doses

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
to actually increase
visual acuity.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the stage of evolution
where human beings encountered

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:28.060 align:middle line:84%
psilocybin mushrooms, we
were essentially baboon-like,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:84%
pack hunting hordes of velt
living creatures in Africa.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.860 align:middle line:84%
In that situation, a compound
which increases visual acuity

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
will give a tremendous
adaptive advantage

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.310 align:middle line:84%
to the animals that are
including it in their diet.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And those animals not
including it in their diet

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
will be quickly
eliminated by the process

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.260 align:middle line:84%
of natural selection from
the evolutionary scenario.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's possible to argue that
this mind-manifesting quality

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.560 align:middle line:84%
of the psychedelics
actually conferred

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
an evolutionary advantage on
certain primates, who then were

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
able to bootstrap themselves
to higher and higher states

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:90%
of reflective self-awareness.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
This may lie behind the very
early coincidence of cattle,

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
goddesses, and mushrooms
in the apparent obsessions

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
of early man as reflected
by the cave paintings

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:40.420 align:middle line:84%
on the Algerian plateau and
in southern France and Spain.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
We always find the
notion of the mystery

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.840 align:middle line:84%
circa 18,000 years ago connected
with the idea of cattle.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And we always find the cattle
connected with the notion

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.510 align:middle line:90%
of the great goddess.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
Now it may be that the
hidden and third member

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.620 align:middle line:84%
of this trinity was a
hallucinogenic mushroom

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:90%
of some sort.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We've got only
about two minutes left,

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.917 align:middle line:84%
but I wonder what
the connection--

00:25:06.917 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't quite see it-- between
the mushroom, the cattle,

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:90%
and the goddess.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The mushrooms grow in
the manure of the cattle.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:20.890 align:middle line:10%
When the hunting packs of
early primates followed along

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:10%
behind the cattle, they
inevitably encountered

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.290 align:middle line:10%
the mushroom, ate it,
had their visual skills

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:34.030 align:middle line:10%
thereby increased, bred
more readily, therefore,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.270 align:middle line:10%
and survive more easily than
their non-mushroom eating

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.380 align:middle line:10%
cousins.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so the eating of
mushrooms and the development

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
of higher aspects
of consciousness,

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.480 align:middle line:84%
including self-reflection,
were, thereby, enforced,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.660 align:middle line:84%
leading to the conclusion
that it was actually

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.410 align:middle line:84%
a symbiotic relationship
between the early primates

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and these hallucinogenic
plants that

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
laid the basis for
the appearance of what

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:90%
we call human beings.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, Terrence McKenna.

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.420 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
interesting discussion.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.810 align:middle line:84%
You seem to be suggesting
that our evolution, I suppose,

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
from the animal kingdom
into the human kingdom

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.760 align:middle line:84%
itself was catalyzed
or triggered

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.050 align:middle line:84%
by our encounter with
these hallucinogenics.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:23.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we are an ape with
a symbiotic relationship

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:90%
to a mushroom.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And that has given us
self-reflection, language,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
religion, and all the
spectrum of effects

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
that flow from these things.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And one can only wonder
how these hallucinogens

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.710 align:middle line:84%
might affect our future
evolution as well.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> They have brought
us to this point.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we make our
relationship to them conscious,

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.990 align:middle line:84%
we may be able to take control
of our future evolutionary

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:90%
path.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Terrence McKenna, thank you
very much for being with me.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.680 align:middle line:90%

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.540 align:middle line:90%
>> For me, too.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:84%
And thank you very
much for being with us.
