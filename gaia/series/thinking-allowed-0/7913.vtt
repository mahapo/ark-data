00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to
look at spirituality

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.100 align:middle line:84%
from a cross-cultural
perspective.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Joan Halifax,
roshi of the Upaya Zen Center

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
in Santa Fe, New
Mexico, anthropologist,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and author of a number of books,
including "Shamanic Voices,"

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
"The Human Encounter
with Death,"

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
"The Fruitful Darkness," "A
Buddhist Life in America,"

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and "Being with Dying."

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Joan.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jeffrey.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590 align:middle line:84%
You recently
returned from Tibet.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think Tibet is a marvelous
example of a culture that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.140 align:middle line:84%
has created a fusion
of a Buddhist tradition

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
and a shamanic tradition.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
The elements there
are so unmediated.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And the space is
so huge that you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:84%
can see that it would
be very easy for people

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to project their imaginations
into the vastness.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's true.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I just returned day
before yesterday

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.170 align:middle line:84%
from a six-week pilgrimage
to Mount Kailash,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.720 align:middle line:84%
walking across the
Himalayas into Tibet

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and circumambulating
the mountain,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
doing a retreat on
Lake Manasarovar,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
and then going to
Gurugram and Tirthapuri,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and then coming back to
the Limi Valley, which

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.620 align:middle line:84%
is actually in Northern Nepal,
but is a Tibetan domain that

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
has not been contacted
by Europeans or Nepalis,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:90%
particularly, or the Chinese.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.705 align:middle line:84%
It's an extraordinary place that
has been essentially untouched.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:90%
>> One of the few left on Earth.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that was my experience
in being in the Limi Valley,

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:90%
as though time had stopped.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And you were really
outside of anything

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.430 align:middle line:90%
that we know in Western culture.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
It was extraordinarily
beautiful.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, you feel something
a little different.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You feel actually
quite different.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan diaspora, of course,
is always there in your heart.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's, of course,
particularly going

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
across the border, the
presence of the Chinese.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
encounters that you

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
have with pilgrims along the
way, it's quite heartbreaking.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:84%
They feel in a way
abandoned by the world.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only has the
Dalai Lama left,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.070 align:middle line:84%
and there's a tiny bit
more religious freedom,

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:90%
but the young Karmapa just left.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
So all the heads of the major
schools have left Tibet.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> You came amongst other
reasons to visit Mount Kailash,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:90%
also known--

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Mount Meru.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:90%
It's a sacred mountain.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in
some legends it's

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.442 align:middle line:84%
considered to be the
origin of the world.

00:03:49.442 --> 00:03:56.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Jeffrey, it's a place
that I first went to in 1987.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was inspired by
Lama Govinda's book.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I had read the
book years before.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I really wanted to
go there for some reason.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason is so
private I don't even know it.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And I went.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went under very minimal
circumstances-- hitchhiking

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
and with no food.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And it was a very tough journey.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go back
and had the opportunity

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
to go back last
year, and actually

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:90%
went back this year as well.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, last year when I
returned from Mount Kailash,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I think I returned like a lion.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And this year I feel I
returned like a lamb.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm still quite there in
the vastness of space.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Also, in the spirit
of the Tibetan people,

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
which in spite of the incredible
tragedy of what has happened

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in Tibet and
continues to happen,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.085 align:middle line:84%
their spirit cannot
be vanquished.

00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The mountain itself is
understood to be a deity.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yes.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And you could say
everything is a deity.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and the
other side of it is,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of course, Tibetans
and Hindus and Bon

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:84%
practitioners, and
now many Westerners,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.960 align:middle line:84%
have a feeling about this
mountain that is in a way,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:90%
it's gnostic, it's beyond words.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.260 align:middle line:84%
It is like a diamond
penetrating space.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And it symbolizes and I think
evokes a quality of mind that

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.310 align:middle line:90%
is very vast.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's a kind
of karmic accelerator.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:07.120 align:middle line:84%
When you're there, you really
can make your own difficulties

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.020 align:middle line:90%
become more present.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of the ritual
activity around this mountain,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure goes
back a long time,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
probably well prior to the
Buddhist entry into Tibet,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.940 align:middle line:84%
is the practice of
circumambulating--

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> The mountain.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a word for
pilgrimage in Tibet,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
and the word is yatra.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of interesting
because yatra is generally

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:84%
translated as pilgrimage,
but it actually

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
means a journey that never ends.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So we go to Tibet, but, well,
it reminds me of a saying.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, I was
in a zen interview

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.510 align:middle line:84%
and I asked the roshi a
question of a two-line poem that

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
went something like,
going to the temple you

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.910 align:middle line:84%
take the path, entering the
temple, you leave the path.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.900 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what does this mean.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Joan, the
path is the temple.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:84%
So every step of the way
truly for me was arriving.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And it includes making
the decision even to go.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:90%
The mountain is there.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And the mountain in
a way, you embody it

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
by walking around
it because it is

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
an incredible
physical challenge.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The pass you go
over is 18,600 feet.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:40.000 align:middle line:84%
You're in very high altitude
coming to the mountain.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And you're in a circumstance of
extreme simplicity, minimality.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
So things are very
stripped down.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And when you walk around
the mountain itself,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.080 align:middle line:90%
your legs take the mountain in.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're drinking
the water the rivers

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:90%
that flow from the mountain.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:90%
And that goes into your body.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And the atmosphere of the
mountain is entering your body.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And I still feel very
present with that mountain.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if you'll forgive me
for pulling you away a little

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:90%
bit.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Jeffrey.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember, I said for the
interview, my mute button

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:90%
is pushed.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I'll wax loquacious.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.510 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know that you
began some of your work

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
as a spiritual seeker and as
an anthropologist on a similar

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned, since
the journey is the temple,

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought I would take
you for a moment back

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to the Sahara Desert
and your visit

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.095 align:middle line:90%
with the Dogon People of Mali.

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that journey in a way
was prompted by the fact that I

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.060 align:middle line:90%
was raised in the South.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And we had a woman in my
family who was African-American

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.230 align:middle line:90%
who raised me.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.980 align:middle line:90%
And her mother had been a slave.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And she had an extraordinary
sense of freedom.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And it was out of
my relationship

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
with her that I wanted to
explore something about Africa.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I went first to the
Musée de l'Homme and worked with

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
the Committee to Film
Ethnographique in Paris.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, in '69 and
'70, drove across the Sahara

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.260 align:middle line:84%
to the Dogon, and was
there for a rite of passage

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
that happens once
every 53 to 60 years,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:90%
which is called the sigui.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:38.320 align:middle line:84%
That was a very powerful
event, which helped me valorize

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
or come to understand the
importance of the ritual

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:90%
process in the life of a people.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> As I recall your
description of it,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:84%
you came back from that
experience amongst some

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:84%
of the most impoverished
people on Earth,

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
feeling that we in the West
are impoverished spiritually

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:90%
in comparison.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could say the
most impoverished people

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.270 align:middle line:84%
on the Earth could be the
Eritreans or the Tibetans

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.605 align:middle line:90%
or people from Mali.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
This simplicity that
living close to the Earth

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:84%
gives rise to is
something that I

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
feel is so deeply enriching
for the human spirit

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.060 align:middle line:84%
because it requires the
imagination and the spirit

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:90%
to engage.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
And so those cultures
that are Earth-cherishing,

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.310 align:middle line:84%
so-called Earth-cherishing
culture or cultures

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:44.620 align:middle line:84%
that are grown out of and
built from the Earth, I think,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:84%
have for us there's a
deep sense of nostalgia

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that arises for Westerners in
relation to these cultures,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.380 align:middle line:84%
because they remember
something in their own lives

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.241 align:middle line:84%
which is there but
has been forgotten.

00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Joan, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:05.530 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "Thinking
Aloud." once again,

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Joan Halifax,
roshi of the Upaya Zen

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
an anthropologist, as well.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:84%
We are exploring cross-cultural
approaches to spirituality.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
A moment ago, Joan,
before our break,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.440 align:middle line:84%
you talked about the
feeling that many

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
of the indigenous peoples
have toward the Earth.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
I think an interesting
part of your own path,

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.340 align:middle line:84%
the temple of which
you have made it,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:84%
also includes your work with the
Quechua Indians in Northern New

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
Mexico who are very grounded in
their connection to the Earth

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and who also ingest the peyote
plant as part of their rituals.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, the Quechuas are
people from the Sierra Madre

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Occidental in Mexico.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had read
about them and heard

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
about them from my
friend Barbara Myerhoff,

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and also my friend Peter
Furst, who worked with them--

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.290 align:middle line:90%
two anthropologists.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Was very interested in them.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was in I guess 1973
that a small group of Quechuas

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:90%
at Esalen Institute.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And they had a beautiful
quality about them.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And they were mixing up a pot of
something and I had some of it.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I looked into the
eyes of some of the people

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and it really
ignited my compassion

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:84%
to ingest peyote with them,
and also to feel something

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:90%
about their wisdom.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So I spent time over
the years with Quechuas,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
going down to Mexico, and
also Quechuas who came here.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And I found my experience
with these people

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:90%
to be incredibly healing.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
Part of it was a sort of
mountain spirit, which

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.710 align:middle line:90%
really is agreeable to me.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's why I return so
often to the Himalayas.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And part of it was there
is such a strong emphasis

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:90%
on healing in their culture.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, which
was in the early '70s,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
I was having a lot of
emotional problems.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was nothing conventional
could touch me, if you will.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
In a way, I was too familiar
with psychology and psychiatry

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:90%
and very resistant.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.340 align:middle line:84%
I went to study
healing and actually I

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.890 align:middle line:84%
ended up being healed, if
you will, in the process,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:53.390 align:middle line:90%
really strengthened.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was not really so
much through the psychedelics

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
through peyote in terms of the
fantasticness of the visions.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It was really in the
quality of the interaction

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:90%
with the people.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:16.100 align:middle line:84%
These were hearty, complex,
devious, humorous, and very

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:84%
compassionate people who were
extraordinarily kind to me.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:90%
And that kindness touched me.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It really benefited me.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I recall vividly a
description that you once said

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of, I believe, it was the
Shaman Don Jose there, you said,

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:84%
looking into his face was like
looking back 10,000 years.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Jeffrey, I was
married to Stan Grof and worked

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in a contemporary situation
with hallucinogens.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And it was interesting to be
involved with hallucinogens

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
with indigenous peoples because
I realized that we Westerners,

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we might have some great
understanding of psychology,

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.010 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have much of
an understanding of the mind

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
The mind is bigger
than the psyche.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And so it was an
extraordinary experience

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.370 align:middle line:84%
to be in peyote
ceremony with him

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and to experience something
like the transmission

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:28.740 align:middle line:84%
through generations of
shamanic wisdom, if you will,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that he then
realized in his life,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and that was made
manifest through

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:84%
the ceremonial experience and
the experience with peyote.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.630 align:middle line:84%
He was a great old
person, really,

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:90%
I think you probably met him.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
He was just incredibly
humorous and compassionate.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was just
with a Tibetan man

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
who reminded me a
lot of Don Jose,

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
a man called Kunga
Dorje, who has

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:07.530 align:middle line:84%
that same quality of impishness
and intensity and deep love.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now it strikes me
that you've done something with

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.220 align:middle line:84%
your own life, which is similar
to what the Tibetan culture has

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.300 align:middle line:84%
done-- you are Buddhist
roshi of a zen center.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You've moved from a
shamanistic practice

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to a Buddhist practice, which
is much what Tibetan Buddhism

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:90%
itself has done.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in a way
yes and in a way no.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.460 align:middle line:84%
It was in the mid-'60s that
I began to read Buddhism.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I actually began to
practice in the early '70s.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, it was
really before that.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Meditation was
something that was

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
part of our life in the '60s,
but I didn't have a teacher

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%
until the early mid '70s.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And these were like two
separate tracks for me.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And they stayed separate
for a long time.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.360 align:middle line:84%
It was really hard for
me to reconcile them.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
practice Zen Buddhism,

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.050 align:middle line:84%
having been inspired by the
books of DT Suzuki and Alan

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:84%
Watts, and then
having zen teachers.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
And it's very plain and
there's completely no emphasis

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:90%
on any visionary states.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.599 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there's
this psychedelic continuum,

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.900 align:middle line:90%
very visionary.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting what's
happened to me over the years.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:90%
It's like a paring down process.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point, I
felt a real synthesis

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:90%
between the two traditions.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But as I've grown
older, I'm almost 60,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I have this feeling of just life
being pared down to a minimum.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's not shamanism
and it's not Buddhism either,

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
even though I practice
every day in my zen center.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:05.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Something is happening as
well to Buddhism in America.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And I feel part of that
change, being a woman,

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
having been given inka, which
is a very rare situation,

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
having done meditation
practice now for many years.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you define that
term, having been given inka.

00:18:26.956 --> 00:18:36.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Inka is where you could say
on one level the umbilical cord

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
is cut between me
and my teacher,

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.415 align:middle line:84%
on another level roshi
just means old teacher.

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:90%
It means seal.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.745 align:middle line:84%
But it really means that
you're just an old teacher.

00:18:56.745 --> 00:19:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.340 align:middle line:84%
This is in with within
the Japanese continuum.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And Jeffrey, being
in Japan recently

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and seeing how much
sexism there is in Japan

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and also being an American
woman and a Buddhist

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
and realizing the profound
value of the contribution

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that women have made to Buddhism
in this culture, not only

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.080 align:middle line:84%
feminine values, but the
democratization of Buddhism,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as emphasis on
family and community

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:39.880 align:middle line:90%
and social service.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:84%
In a certain way, being on top
of the pile, I'm off of it,

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:90%
if you know what I'm saying.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:58.690 align:middle line:84%
In a way, it's wonderful to have
received this authorization.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:04.760 align:middle line:84%
In another, it
remains to be seen.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I can reflect
back a little bit because I

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:90%
haven't seen in a long time.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I remember, 25
years or so ago, we

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:17.740 align:middle line:84%
were together at the Esalen
Institute on the dance floor.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And you struck me
then, honestly,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.440 align:middle line:90%
as a very sexy person.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
And now I see what's
coming through

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:84%
is what you described
in Don Jose--

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:90%
the wisdom of 10,000 years.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.960 align:middle line:84%
It's written on
your face, to me,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.260 align:middle line:84%
as evidently as you must
have seen it on his.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that the wisdom of
10,000 years is in everybody.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And maybe I and lots
of others, we've

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
just been sort of worn away.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And what's inherent is showing
through just a little bit.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
And maybe because
I've just come back

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:84%
from such a tough, physical,
and spiritual and psychological

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.825 align:middle line:90%
journey, I really feel--

00:21:07.825 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.280 align:middle line:84%
it's strange to say, very
vulnerable, very undefended.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's in part the
mountain, but it's in part

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the people of the mountain,
the people from Humla

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and the Tibetan people,
who are so undefended,

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
whose dispositions are so
good, who are so incredibly

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.350 align:middle line:90%
humorous and kind.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And it disarms you.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is for
me almost greater

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:90%
than the gift of the mountain.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.755 align:middle line:84%
It's the good heart of
the mountain people.

00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a quality I
would really love

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:56.130 align:middle line:90%
to see invoked in our culture.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.430 align:middle line:90%
It's invocable.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we probably owe
much more to those indigenous

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.130 align:middle line:90%
peoples than we appreciate.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think for you, Joan, that
an important part of your path

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
also has been being in the
forests, being in the desert,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:90%
being in the mountain.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.070 align:middle line:84%
You seem to have learned
as much from nature as

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.371 align:middle line:90%
from your teachers.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember one time,
Jeffrey, Seonsanim,

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
my first Buddhist teacher,
was at the Ojai Foundation,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
which I started years ago.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.376 align:middle line:84%
And in the audience was RD
Laing, the psychiatrist.

00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:36.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:22:36.415 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And Ronnie didn't
like Seonsanim at all.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And he was just snarling as
Seonsanim was giving this talk.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he snarled in
his Scottish brogue.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:52.553 align:middle line:90%
And he said, you're no teacher.

00:22:52.553 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to have to
interrupt you, though, Joan,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're out
of time for now.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I'll finish
this story later.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, yes, check your
program guides for part 2

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:84%
of our two-part series on
cross-cultural spirituality

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.380 align:middle line:90%
with Joan Halifax.
