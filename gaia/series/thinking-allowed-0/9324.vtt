conversations on the leading

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:31.713 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
transforming our relationship

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
with the Earth.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.710 align:middle line:90%
My guest is Dr. Ralph Metzner--

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
a professor of psychology
at the California Institute

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
of Integral Studies.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.580 align:middle line:84%
He is the author
of numerous books,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
including "The Psychedelic
Experience," "Maps

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
of Consciousness," "The Well
of Remembrance," "the Unfolding

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.550 align:middle line:84%
Self," "Ayahuasca,"
and "Green Psychology."

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:84%
He is president of the
Green Earth Foundation.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Ralph.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You point out that
it's really striking,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
perhaps even amazing that the
whole discipline of psychology

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
has attempted to come up with
a theory of mind of the human

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.390 align:middle line:84%
being that's sort of completely
isolated from the environment.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, that struck
me as very interesting.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
When you look into
psychology textbooks,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
you never see the Earth
mentioned or referred

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
to or animals, or
anything like that.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And I realized one time that if
we had a psychologist basically

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
assume everything
important that goes on

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.980 align:middle line:84%
in this intrapsychically
or interpersonally.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And we have
psychology of groups.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But that's a function
of the way knowledge

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:90%
is organized in disciplines.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:84%
You say, well, that's
some other department.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized, well, but
it should make a difference

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:84%
really that we live on
this Earth in this ecology.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
I thought if we lived on Mars,
or if we lived on a spaceship,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:84%
our psychology
would be the same.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:90%
And that seems weird.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So then I began to
read the writings

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.610 align:middle line:90%
of ecological philosophers.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And they, of course, say,
well, yes, ecology is relevant.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:90%
Like Ted Roszak said--

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.720 align:middle line:84%
and others have said--
well, obviously, we

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.850 align:middle line:84%
live in this environment,
this kind of environment,

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:90%
these kind of ecosystems.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:90%
Surely, that makes a difference.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And so eco psychology, or as
I call it, green psychology,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is the beginnings of an
attempt to rethink psychology

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.810 align:middle line:84%
to take the ecology
into account.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems as if there's
something that happened

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
to the Western psyche perhaps
a few hundred years ago that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
caused us to become so alienated
from our fundamental connection

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.870 align:middle line:84%
with the planet itself that
we've forgotten about it.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
the key question.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when you look
at the psychology, so why is it?

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And from-- see, the stimulus
to that kind of questioning

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
environmental crisis.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.000 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up to
the fact that well, it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:90%
a man-made crisis.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It's not caused by any other
species or random events,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
or outer space, or
anything like that.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.737 align:middle line:84%
So it must be something in
the psychology of human beings

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that the way they conceive
of themselves and their

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
placed in the universe and
what we're supposed to be doing

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.240 align:middle line:84%
and how we're supposed
to be related.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
Because it can't be right.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It can't be right
that one species gets

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:84%
to destroy the habitats
for countless thousands

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.390 align:middle line:84%
of other species
and degrade life

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:84%
on the planet
perhaps irreparably

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:90%
and cause massive change.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.770 align:middle line:90%
That's not adaptive.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not sustainable.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's human beings
that are doing it.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.040 align:middle line:84%
But then, human beings
have this whole history.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.980 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So from a psychological
point of view, I said,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.140 align:middle line:90%
I asked myself the question.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.433 align:middle line:84%
What is the nature
of this split?

00:03:58.433 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:90%
How did it come about?

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.370 align:middle line:90%
What--

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the psychopathology.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a chapter that I
call the psychopathology

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.318 align:middle line:84%
of the human nature
relationship.

00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And what have we learned from
individual psychopathology that

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.320 align:middle line:84%
might apply or
help us understand

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:84%
this kind of collective
psychopathology

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
or this dysfunctional
civilization

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:90%
as Al Gore called it.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And then the additional
question would be, well, OK, so

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.360 align:middle line:84%
given what it is, then how did
it come about historically?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:90%
And so then you go into history.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And you can trace
that really far back.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And then basically what
are some alternatives

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that one could find that would
point a different direction?

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, historically,
if I recall correctly,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.010 align:middle line:84%
you trace our alienation from
the environment back to a point

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
at which somewhere
in our history,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:84%
we determined that we could
dominate the environment rather

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
than be part of an ecosystem.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, many people
have worked on this.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So-- but I actually see it
as having developed in stages

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:90%
progressively.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The latest, let's say,
going backward in time,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.370 align:middle line:84%
the latest stage
one might say would

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.080 align:middle line:90%
be the scientific revolution.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what's called the
beginning of the modern age

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in the 16th, 15th,
16th century when

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
we adopted a world view
that was mechanistic,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.750 align:middle line:90%
which didn't allow for--

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:84%
which didn't treat
nature as having

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.790 align:middle line:90%
subjective consciousness.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And beings are simply the
backdrop or resources,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
as we now think of it, to
be used for human beings.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And that facilitated a
exploitative attitude

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and the rise of the
scientific establishment

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
was based on a kind of a deal
with science and religion

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
where science took over
the exploration and then

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.910 align:middle line:84%
the management of
the material world

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.970 align:middle line:84%
and left all questions of
purpose and value and spirit

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and subjectivity to the
church because they had to.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:90%
It was a political arrangement.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And so-- but then when it
has been traced for the back

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.260 align:middle line:84%
to religious
ideology, particularly

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.440 align:middle line:84%
the Judaeo-christian
monotheistic notions

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
of a transcendental
created deity

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:84%
who lives in some heaven
far away, separated

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.100 align:middle line:84%
from the natural
world, and with that,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
then the natural world becomes
mundane or even profane

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:90%
in other words.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the names of the
devil in the medieval times

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:90%
was Lord of this World.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So the body, nature,
the flesh, they all

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
have this original sin.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.040 align:middle line:84%
But again, there are
alternative traditions.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And one can trace it
further several other steps

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:90%
further back.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.250 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to
the earliest step,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you go with people like
Paul Shepherd, who says--

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:90%
whom I like very much--

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.670 align:middle line:84%
who says well, the
earliest step was really

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:55.540 align:middle line:84%
what it's called domestication
or the agricultural revolution

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.975 align:middle line:84%
because when people started
farming and herding instead

00:06:59.975 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
of hunting and gathering, when
the hunting and gathering,

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:90%
they're following nature.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
When they're
farming and herding,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:84%
they're beginning to
manage and control it.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's the big--

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> 20,000 years ago.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah,
10,000, 12,000 BC.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
not that long a time

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
compared to hundreds
of thousands,

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
maybe millions of years a
hunter gatherer existence.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually quite hopeful
to think of it that way.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, it doesn't
mean that he's saying

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or people like myself are
saying we have to go back

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:90%
to being hunter gatherers.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:84%
But what it does
say is that you want

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:84%
to go back and try to understand
what was given up then,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.120 align:middle line:84%
certain attitudes, perhaps,
certain values, certain ways

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the world,
that we could do well

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.120 align:middle line:84%
to preserve and recapture
even while we live in a,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:90%
modern technological world.

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we're experiencing
an incredible degradation

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.150 align:middle line:90%
of the environment now.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Species are going extinct
at an enormous rate.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:84%
But in all fairness, these
kinds of cataclysmic changes

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
have occurred in earlier epochs
without human intervention.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we're just
doing nature's work.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah, that's an
argument that's sometimes made

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.650 align:middle line:84%
when people say, oh, well, there
have been extinctions before.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:90%
90% of species have been lost.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
So just relax and, you
know, keep on polluting.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.160 align:middle line:84%
People say there have been these
five major extinction spasms.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.976 align:middle line:84%
This is the sixth
extinction that we're in.

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.559 align:middle line:84%
It is different,
however, because it's

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
the only one that's caused
by one particular species.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is true, I would accept
that argument, in the sense,

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:90%
from Gaian perspective.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
We're not we're not capable
of assuming responsibility

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
for the planet, for
the fate of the planet.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:84%
But from a philosophical,
psychological point of view,

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
we are responsible for what
we do, both we as individuals,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and we as groups, and
collectives, as a society.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems to me, based
on current human tendencies,

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.890 align:middle line:84%
human psychology, even if we
master one aspect of this,

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:84%
if we stopped
polluting the waters,

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.350 align:middle line:84%
we're likely to
do something else.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It seems like such an
unmanageable problem.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, yeah, well, that's
what radical ecologists say.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to go further than
just attacking it piecemeal,

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
this issue, or that
issue, that issue.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.098 align:middle line:84%
Although any specific
person, or individual,

00:09:35.098 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
or group, of course,
then, you always

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:90%
have to pick your battles.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
But what we're really looking
for is a change in world view,

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.370 align:middle line:84%
and a different kind of world,
a bit different basic approach

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:84%
which would then allow for
these changes to occur.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.290 align:middle line:84%
So the concept of world view, I
think, is very important to me.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And I teach all that.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And part of the psychology of
that, part of the worldview

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
is, well, how do we
conceive ourselves?

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.550 align:middle line:90%
What's our role?

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:84%
What kind of world
do we live in?

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.750 align:middle line:90%
And what is our role?

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And that the current world
view, the modern world view

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.360 align:middle line:84%
associated with science
is not religious.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Religion, the church--
the Christian Church

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.580 align:middle line:84%
was the dominant ideology
in the Middle Ages.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:90%
But it's not really anymore.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And the current
worldview basically

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.430 align:middle line:84%
sees us as are the
masters of the universe.

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We get to do with the planet
whatever we feel like.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.753 align:middle line:84%
And it's called homocentric
or a speciesist prejudice.

00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And I make the argument,
I follow the argument

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:40.540 align:middle line:84%
of others, who have said
that this assumption

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.870 align:middle line:84%
of human superiority, that
we are somehow assuming--

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
assuming, not demonstrating,
but assuming that we're

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.747 align:middle line:84%
superior to all
other forms of life,

00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:53.080 align:middle line:84%
all other forms of animals,
and so forth, and therefore,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.970 align:middle line:84%
have the right to do
with other forms of life

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.140 align:middle line:90%
whatever we want to.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly analogous to
racism, sexism, nationalism,

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
and other forms
of human prejudice

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:84%
where one group of
human beings assumes--

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
again, without evidence--
that because they're

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
superior to this other
group, whatever it may be,

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
defined in whatever
way, then they

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
have the right to dominate,
discriminate, against exploit,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.737 align:middle line:90%
or even exterminate.

00:11:15.737 --> 00:11:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Ralph, we're going
to take a short break.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.178 align:middle line:84%
We'll be back in
just a few moments.

00:11:20.178 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to
"Thinking Aloud."

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
We are discussing
how we can transform

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
our precarious
relationship to the Earth.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:42.170 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr. Ralph Metzner,
author of "Green Psychology."

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Ralph, we've talked quite
a bit now about the problem

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.330 align:middle line:84%
that humans are
facing on this planet

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and how deeply rooted
it is in our sense

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:90%
that we can dominate the planet.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
As an alternative,
you do suggest

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that we look towards the
values and lifestyles

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.780 align:middle line:84%
of indigenous peoples and
other mystical cultures

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.830 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, well, it turns out--

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.670 align:middle line:84%
so sustainability is an
ecological value concept

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.045 align:middle line:84%
that environmentalists
say, we're

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to find a
sustainable economy,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.700 align:middle line:84%
a sustainable forestry,
sustainable farming.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Which means that you don't
extract the resources at a rate

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:84%
faster than they
can be replaced.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.270 align:middle line:84%
So that future beings,
human and otherwise,

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
can also live in that planet.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
So then, you look around.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are these
indigenous people--

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:90%
we call them indigenous people--

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
massively being driven to
extinction and an extermination

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.150 align:middle line:84%
under the onslaught of the kind
of global capitalist system.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:90%
But they have sustainability.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, they
wouldn't still be here.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.783 align:middle line:90%
Take California Indians.

00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Westerners have
been in California

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
for 200 years, a little
bit more than 200 years.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Before that, California Indians
lived here for 8,000 years.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, if that isn't
sustainability, what is?

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that they were
always ecological saints

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and did no harm.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They also affected
their environment,

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
but nothing even remotely
like the scale that

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:90%
has happened since that time.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So the practices and the values
of indigenous people-- and then

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.512 align:middle line:84%
that ties into the
religious dimensions

00:13:22.512 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual dimensions.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Because traditional
Earth people tend

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to have an attitude where they
see nature as being sacred

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
or as having subjective
consciousness and deserving,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:90%
therefore, of respect.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, Native
Americans did not

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.943 align:middle line:84%
conceive their environment
as a wilderness.

00:13:41.943 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
The Europeans came and said,
oh, well, this is wilderness,

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
and there's a bunch of savages
running around just wild.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a concept that
Native American people use.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, that's all our
relations, all my relations.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So animals, trees,
forests, the spirits

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
of mountains and rivers, it
was animistic and shamanistic.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
What animism means, that it's
animated by living intelligence

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
that is traditionally
called "spirits."

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.170 align:middle line:90%
That's not symbolic.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.287 align:middle line:84%
See, if I'm a Jungian
psychologist, I might say,

00:14:17.287 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
well, this is an archetype
or something like that.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.590 align:middle line:84%
The traditional people
didn't use that language.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Why should they?

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:90%
They said, it's spirit.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not a projection of human
consciousness into nature.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.913 align:middle line:84%
It's a perception of
non-human consciousness

00:14:30.913 --> 00:14:32.580 align:middle line:84%
in non-human nature,
which is very word.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, we're
projecting onto the world

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.125 align:middle line:84%
our idea that it's just
kind of mechanistic, inert,

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:40.925 align:middle line:90%
and lifeless.

00:14:40.925 --> 00:14:41.725 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:42.800 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
That's just as
much a projection.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And the usual assumption that
primitive people, so-called,

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
project human qualities
on the environment

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.200 align:middle line:90%
is a complete misperception.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.320 align:middle line:84%
They don't assume that only
humans have consciousness.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:90%
Why should they assume that?

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:84%
They, in fact, say
things like, well,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, in ancient
times, humans

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.200 align:middle line:84%
used to be able to understand
the language of animals.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And they used to understand us.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:90%
We used to have conversations.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And so even the
hunters who would hunt,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
they would ask for permission
from the spirit of the animal

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
that we were hunting.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
And they would never
waste anything.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.493 align:middle line:84%
They would take only
what they needed.

00:15:21.493 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And they would use everything
and wouldn't waste.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So that a sustainable-- and
respect, a quality of respect

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.420 align:middle line:90%
built into it.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.642 align:middle line:84%
If you regard nature as
just inert background,

00:15:31.642 --> 00:15:32.600 align:middle line:90%
you don't have respect.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Why should you?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So that calls for a rethinking
of our basic relationship.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And people come to
that in various ways.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, I see the
revival of interest

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.480 align:middle line:84%
in shamanism, for example, as
being really parallel to that.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Because shamanism is the oldest
spiritual and healing tradition

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And it involves going into an
altered state of consciousness,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.440 align:middle line:84%
whether through
particular plants,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.150 align:middle line:84%
hallucinogenic or
visionary plants,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.240 align:middle line:84%
or through rhythmic drumming,
or through things like fasting,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:84%
or isolation, or a vision
quest in the desert

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
or in the wilderness,
and finding a vision,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
finding a healing
power, a connection

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual power,
which could then

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.010 align:middle line:84%
be used by the practitioner
for the purposes of healing,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and divination, or
finding knowledge.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It's always done
through spirits.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
It's never done just
for the psychology.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
big difference.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, see,
traditional worldview

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.910 align:middle line:90%
of traditional people--

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
you could call it "shamanistic,"
and "mystic," also

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:90%
"panentheistic."

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
If you used
theological language,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
then you would say
panentheism, meaning

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:84%
that the deity or the divinity
is inherent in everything,

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is a worldview that is much
larger than the worldview

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.598 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:16:47.598 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
Because the worldview
that we live in

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.430 align:middle line:84%
recognizes only one level
of reality as being real,

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
the material level that can be
measured and seen, and touched,

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.040 align:middle line:84%
and described with
our instruments.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Everything else is merely--

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.393 align:middle line:90%
as we say, merely subjective.

00:17:02.393 --> 00:17:04.310 align:middle line:84%
The world of mind, the
world of consciousness,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
the worlds of feelings,
intuitions, possible beings,

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
The traditional
worldview says there

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
are many worlds, many
levels of consciousness,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
many different kinds of
beings in these worlds.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And the material level is
certainly real, but no more

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
real than the others.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
So it's a more
inclusive worldview.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say the
material level is unreal.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
It's not an idealist
philosophy that

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.297 align:middle line:84%
says everything is consciousness
and nothing is really real.

00:17:33.297 --> 00:17:34.130 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't say that.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle line:84%
It says there are many
aspects of reality.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You point out that
there are about, I think,

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:84%
600 million indigenous
people still living

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.440 align:middle line:84%
in their communities
on this planet.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.990 align:middle line:84%
That's about 10% of
the planet still,

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:52.190 align:middle line:84%
and that their worldview, which
we have treated disparagingly,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is something that we
really desperately need.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:18:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They have an important gift that
we should learn how to respect.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, exactly.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I traveled in Chiapas, Mexico,
and had the opportunity

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.020 align:middle line:84%
to visit with some
Lacandon Indians

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
in Chiapas who are sort of
the descendant of the Mayas.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And they live-- like my European
ancestors lived 5,000 years

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
ago, in the cultures of
neolithic village cultures

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:90%
of old Europe--

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:84%
kind of a mixed farming,
gardening economy, and a world

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
imbued with spiritual
intelligence,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.110 align:middle line:84%
where they do a lot of
singing, and chanting,

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and invocation of
spiritual powers.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And I realized when
I was down there,

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.038 align:middle line:84%
we have this terminology
of the first world--

00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't have a
second world anymore,

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.663 align:middle line:90%
that was the Soviet Union.

00:18:44.663 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And the third world, we see
these so-called underdeveloped

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.690 align:middle line:90%
countries.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to see what's
called development basically

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.550 align:middle line:84%
as a continuation of
colonialism by another name,

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.350 align:middle line:90%
economic exploitation and use.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And in the fourth world,
these indigenous people

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:90%
are very much marginalized.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.323 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I
realized that if you're

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:06.740 align:middle line:84%
going to be
historically accurate,

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.490 align:middle line:84%
we should call that
world the first world.

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:90%
Because they were here first.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
And they've been here longest.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And what we call
now the first world

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
is first only in terms of
military power and domination.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.160 align:middle line:90%
But it's really the latest.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of superimposed
on these earlier worlds.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> The first shall be the last.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:90%
And the last shall be the first.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.440 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, we have a lot
to learn from these people.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And when I was down in that
village, they had television.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, they don't
really need television.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
This whole idea that they
needed to be developed,

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that's an illusion
foisted upon them by--

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:90%
they were doing just fine.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
If left alone, they would
still be doing just fine.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And so there has been this
superstructure of exploitation,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
use, and these national
and then multinational

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
corporations that exploit
the resources to accumulate

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:90%
ever more wealth.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:10.100 align:middle line:90%
And so that all needs to change.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have any illusions
that any one individual

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
or group can effect
significant change.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.360 align:middle line:84%
But we're here to
do what we can.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And why would we--

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:90%
we're part of it.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
As you say, we are
part of nature, too.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We're not observing
this from some distance

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:90%
from some other planet.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:84%
So you do what we
can, what feels right,

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
what one ever is motivated
to do the right thing.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And to me, from a
psychological point of view,

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the most significant
contribution

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I could think of
making would be to help

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.010 align:middle line:84%
people change their
thinking and become

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
more conscious of the implicit
and unconscious assumptions

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.600 align:middle line:90%
that we make.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You also speak about eco
feminism as a tradition that

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the same way that
we abuse our mother, the Earth,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
is how we have been abusing
women in our culture,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:90%
that there's a correlation.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the eco feminists say,
that's one of the movements,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
the schools of thought that have
been called radical ecology.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
The radical ecologists
say you know

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.290 align:middle line:84%
you have to go beyond simply
recycling, and legislation

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
against pollution, and so forth.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to kind
of go to the roots

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:22.700 align:middle line:84%
and really rethink
the world view.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So deep ecology is
a radical ecology,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:90%
and so is eco feminism.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:84%
The deep ecology says
the root pathology is

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:90%
this anthropocentric viewpoint.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And it says, instead,
that we should really

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
recognize that nature
has value in itself.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
It has intrinsic value.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.400 align:middle line:84%
It has inherent value,
not just use value for us.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And eco feminism
says the same thing.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And it says, in addition, if
you trace it back historically,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.400 align:middle line:84%
you see one of the roots
of the domination of nature

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is the patriarchy, the
beginnings of the patriarchy,

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:84%
which is about 6,000 years,
ago about 4,000 to 5,000 BC.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:90%
BC

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It arose in different
parts of the world,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:90%
maybe simultaneously.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.258 align:middle line:84%
And exactly how it arose is
an interesting historical

00:22:04.258 --> 00:22:05.058 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:22:05.058 --> 00:22:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's really agreed.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.290 align:middle line:84%
But because nature is
usually defined as feminine--

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.990 align:middle line:84%
so the patriarchal domination
of nature is not so much men

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:16.490 align:middle line:84%
against women as patriarchal
the institutions of family,

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.990 align:middle line:84%
society, and state, which
are completely infused with--

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
four to five millennia, they
have been completely part

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.580 align:middle line:84%
of all of our thinking--
and even our thinking,

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:90%
even our ideologies.

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
The ideologies of science
people have pointed out,

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
eco feminists have pointed out,
that the domination of nature

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and the patriarchal domination
of women, and control,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.450 align:middle line:84%
are kind of part and
parcel of the same thing.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And they have to be
challenged and transformed

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.785 align:middle line:84%
at the same time because
they support one another.

00:22:44.785 --> 00:22:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
other movements,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:84%
other schools of
thought, also, radical,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:90%
like social ecologists.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Ralph, we'll talk about those
in part two of our two-part

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.790 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.690 align:middle line:90%
We've covered a lot of ground.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage our viewers
to check their schedules.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:90%
