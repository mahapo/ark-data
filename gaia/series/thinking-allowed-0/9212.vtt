>> "Thinking Allowed,"
conversations on the leading

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery,
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to explore
the human spirit, particularly

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:90%
as it faces an era of disbelief.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.030 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Professor
Huston Smith,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
author of numerous
books, including

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
"The World's Religions,"
"Forgotten Truth," "Beyond the

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Post-Modern Mind," and
most recently, "Why

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Religion Matters."

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.370 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Huston.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always a joy to
be with you, Jeffrey.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> It is a pleasure
for me as well.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking about a
particular discussion

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:84%
from your book,
in which you wrote

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.080 align:middle line:84%
a letter to a
newspaper or a journal

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:84%
critiquing a scientist who had
reviewed a book of theology.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And in his review, he sort of
epitomized the modern viewpoint

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:84%
when he said that science
deals with facts, and theology

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
therefore is sort of relegated
to the world of values and--

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> --words.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> --words.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
>> And you wrote back
to him, and you said,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
you've got it backwards,
because according to theology,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
the only real fact
that exists is spirit.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And everything else is
like shadows on Plato's--

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:84%
on the wall in Plato's great
"Allegory of the Cave," yes.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems as if that's
an important starting point

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
because your fear is
that in our modern age,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:90%
we're losing track of that.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.220 align:middle line:84%
The question is really, is
there another world, one

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
which triumphs over
this mundane world

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
of everyday, common sense?

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's ironic that,
in our time, which

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
is in scientific age,
science says, yes, there

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
is another world, the
quantum world, which,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:84%
as Richard Feynman said,
it's hopeless to try

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to map the quantum world
onto this middle-sized world

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:90%
of our everyday experience.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we know from
their scientific experiment

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that it's that quantum
world that has the power,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.350 align:middle line:84%
and all of this everyday world
floats like almost flotsam

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:90%
and jetsam on that power.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, traditional
philosophies and religions

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
have said the exact
same counterpart.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
There is another world which
is more powerful and better.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there, they introduce
a new concept value

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.070 align:middle line:84%
because science doesn't
deal with values.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's ironic that just at
that time that science is--

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
has proved to us that there is
another world, why they are--

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
or we are questioning that
there is another world,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.870 align:middle line:84%
you might say, at the
other end of the spectrum,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
but equally unable to be
mapped onto this world

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.995 align:middle line:90%
of everyday experience.

00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That's fascinating, but as I
understand it, the scientists,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
many of them at least, will
argue that this quantum reality

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:90%
has no meaning.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:90%
It has no purpose.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:90%
It has no goals or intentions.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
It has-- basically, it's random.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and no qualities, I
would add to your list on that,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.170 align:middle line:84%
but that's only because the
scientific method cannot touch

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:90%
those things.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's no wonder that the
scientists don't read those

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:90%
into the quantum world.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that their
instruments do not pick it up

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.250 align:middle line:84%
is no proof that it
doesn't exist, anymore

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:84%
than the fact that
an X-ray does not

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
show the fullness
of the human body

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:13.390 align:middle line:84%
is no proof that the
three-dimensional body doesn't

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.190 align:middle line:90%
exist.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But, Huston, if I know
you, I'm pretty sure you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't want to equate the
quantum world with the divine

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.630 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely not.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you made that clear.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.420 align:middle line:84%
It's simply in the
basic abstract point,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
they agree there
is another world.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But you're quite right,
and so have philosophers

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and theologians in
the traditional world

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:90%
said the same thing that far.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.465 align:middle line:84%
There is another world that is
more important than this one.

00:05:54.465 --> 00:05:55.715 align:middle line:90%
>> More fundamental than that.

00:05:55.715 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
>> But, thus, there
the analogy stopped

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
because the philosophical
religious view brings in value,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.950 align:middle line:84%
which, as you rightly point out,
that the quantum world cannot

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.750 align:middle line:90%
include.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.190 align:middle line:90%
So we might think of it--

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:84%
here is our middle-sized
world that we're inhabiting,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.120 align:middle line:90%
pleasantly, this morning.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Beneath it, not elsewhere,
it's just in-- is the quantum

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.580 align:middle line:90%
world, another world.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'm going to put it lower
than this because, as you say,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't bring in value,
and above it, in terms,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.230 align:middle line:84%
the vertical dimension
always signifies value.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The other world of the
philosophers and the religion

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.770 align:middle line:84%
is not only more powerful,
but it is better.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to throw in,
to round this off, something--

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.810 align:middle line:84%
well, I started to say, you
won't believe, but you will.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> The audience may--

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
not only is it better,
it's infinitely better

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:18.030 align:middle line:84%
because, as the scholastic
philosophers would call it,

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
it's [LATIN],, in the
Latin, perfect being.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:25.605 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And theology would say, though,
God is the ultimate goodness,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:90%
beauty, and truth.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Or-- and all of
that, but more and more,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
like Satcitananda, of
being, awareness, and bliss,

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.350 align:middle line:84%
and all the full sweep, till
we get the 99 beautiful names

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the Hebrew tradition,
we would add holiness.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>> All qualities that
science does not measure.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And in the modern view,
people would say, well,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.070 align:middle line:84%
that's a psychological
projection.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:90%
It's-- there's nothing to it.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
That's one possibility,
but that's not

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%
the only possibility.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, I'm persuaded,
as you are, too, that that

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:27.020 align:middle line:90%
is far from the full story.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is
pathology in religion,

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:37.740 align:middle line:84%
just as there is
throughout life, and so it

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:90%
serves pathological needs.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And we shouldn't deny
that fact, but pathology

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
is an aberration from
the normal light.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the normal light, this
view of there being another

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
reality as much
greater than we are,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
as the outdoor world of sunshine
and flower is greater than

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.744 align:middle line:84%
the shadow on the
wall of Plato's--

00:09:10.744 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:90%
it's-- well, I'll say it.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what-- it's crazy to
think that there can only be

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:25.020 align:middle line:84%
pathological religion,
when life allows from--

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:90%
for hell, as well as pathology.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And each of the world's
religious traditions affirms

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:90%
this fundamental intuition.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like-- and, to me,
that's an impressive fact.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
It's true that, unlike science,
religion cannot prove its

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:90%
claim.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:84%
But, nevertheless, the fact that
the great parts of the world,

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
families of religion, East Asian
Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism,

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
South Asian Hinduism
and Buddhism,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Western Abrahamic
family of tradition,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
they all converge
independently on the same view

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
of the ultimate reality
being this perfection.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's like
independent verification.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think it--
in our era, there

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.030 align:middle line:84%
are two attacks on the
religious viewpoint.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.570 align:middle line:84%
One is you mentioned the
scientific sense that it's not

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.020 align:middle line:84%
provable, but there's
also the attack

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:48.980 align:middle line:84%
from people who feel
disillusioned with the idea

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:90%
of goodness in the world.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
We've seen so much inhumanity,
holocausts, and wars,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and starvation.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to believe that
there's a caring, good god

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:90%
looking out for us.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That's certainly true.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And this last week,
Kendra and I decided

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to ride Amtrak up to
Davis, rather than driving

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
the freeway.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.410 align:middle line:84%
And as we were waiting
for it to arrive,

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:84%
there was a homeless woman
sitting on the bench--

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.160 align:middle line:84%
was there when we
arrived to wait,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, a poor, ragged,
and missing most of her teeth.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But she had a wonderful smile--
a little crazy, I think,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:84%
and that may have
helped with the smile.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
She turned to Kendra and said,
it don't make sense, does it?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And Kendra said, no,
it doesn't, you know,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
thinking about her
poverty and the dividing--

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.100 align:middle line:84%
the greater distance
between her--

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Kendra said-- and she says,
so you agree with me--

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.460 align:middle line:90%
it don't make sense.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:90%
And that's what you're saying.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
So much of what we experience
in this life don't make sense,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's why many
people look upon the view

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
that it's all ultimately in the
hands of the everlasting arms,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to use personal language,
so incomprehensible in terms

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:90%
of what we daily experience.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Huston, we're going
to take a short break.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.038 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be back.

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:45.531 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Professor
Huston Smith about the fate

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and the future of the human
spirit in an age of disbelief.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think, Huston, the
issue we were touching on

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
before the break
is even a stronger

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.700 align:middle line:84%
issue than the
scientific argument,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
actually, that people
may resort to science,

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's because in some sense
they feel let down by God.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm glad you went
back to that anecdote

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:84%
because, in the same way, I had
an experience which sort of put

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.190 align:middle line:90%
a bookend onto this.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
I was being driven to a
program in San Francisco,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and my driver had been on
Stephen Gaskin's "The Farm."

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and he was a--

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.050 align:middle line:90%
one might say a cult leader or--

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:90%
>> A cult leader?

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.615 align:middle line:90%
>> --a philosopher--

00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:43.415 align:middle line:90%
>> And a--

00:13:43.415 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --who became a religious
leader back in the '70s.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and
it's been a really--

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
on the whole, a very
successful utopian community,

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
but to come to the
point, they had

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to try to be
self-sufficient, and he

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
was assigned refrigeration.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, he hadn't even been past
the fourth grade, and all

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:84%
these diagrams of
electrical circuits,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:90%
he couldn't figure it out.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:90%
So he went to a professional.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The professional explained
it, and so Rob left and said,

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.950 align:middle line:90%
I think I've got it.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And as he went out the
door, the professional

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
hollered after him--

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.440 align:middle line:90%
this is Tennessee, remember--

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.560 align:middle line:90%
don't let it whop you.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And when I match that against
these two experiences of the,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:90%
it don't make sense, does it?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
around, that's right,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're picking up on
that point-- for so many,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:90%
it just doesn't make sense.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think the religious answer
is, but don't let it whop you.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And so those are the bookends
of our everyday experience.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, they say what doesn't
kill you will make you stronger.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And you use a very
interesting metaphor.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.660 align:middle line:84%
You say when a child spills
their ice cream cone,

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.790 align:middle line:84%
it may seem like the
end of the world.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But the parent has a
different perspective.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it really
comes down to that.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:90%
How large is our perspective?

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Because if we let it be confined
by this three-dimensional

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:84%
world, and all the craziness,
and injustice, and so on--

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.890 align:middle line:84%
if that's all we see,
it's absolutely right.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make any sense.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But just as in a great
painting, if you were just

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
to blot out everything but a 6
by 6-inch square and some maybe

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
muddy colors there, and that's
all you saw, why, of course,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:90%
there'd be no beauty there.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:05.765 align:middle line:84%
But if you enlarge
the horizon, and then

00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:84%
that actually
doubles back to show

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.840 align:middle line:84%
how that little area that didn't
mean much in itself actually

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:90%
contributes to the whole.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be right
there encapsulated,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.090 align:middle line:84%
your fundamental argument
about the role of spirit.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.680 align:middle line:84%
It's-- is the wholeness that
makes our lives meaningful.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And we've already said one
cannot prove it, and, yet,

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:84%
we ought to qualify
that, and publicly.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:90%
We cannot prove it.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:56.440 align:middle line:84%
But inwardly, to our self,
why we can modulate our life

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to the point where that
view of the greatness,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.400 align:middle line:84%
the wonder, the awesomeness
of being does make sense.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But we repeat again, not
provable across the board

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.470 align:middle line:90%
to everyone.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But individually, we can open
the eye of the soul, as Plato

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
would call it, the eye of the
heart, as the Sufis would call

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
it, the third eye of the
Tibetan, to the point

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:40.660 align:middle line:84%
where we find ourselves
saying yes, yes, yes.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we're
living in a paradoxical age.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you bemoan to
some degree the scientism,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the skepticism, the lack
of faith and loss of faith.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
it seems there's

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
an incredible revival
of traditional,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and not just traditional, but
even mystical religious values.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
that that is true,

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and one might say that I've
become aware of that in the two

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
years since I actually
completed writing the book.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And I find myself
more optimistic

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
than I was two years ago,
or maybe at any other time

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.382 align:middle line:90%
in our life, that we may--

00:18:33.382 --> 00:18:37.180 align:middle line:84%
you might say this
view of existence

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.220 align:middle line:84%
as meaningless has
kind of bottomed out.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We realized that that is
no philosophy to live by.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so I do believe that there
is a new realization of that,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.890 align:middle line:84%
and people looking for roots
and where meaning lies.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
You refer, for example,
to Friedrich Nietzsche,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.030 align:middle line:84%
a 19th century
philosopher who, I think,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.510 align:middle line:84%
is probably the one who
originated the notion that God

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:90%
is dead.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And you suggest, if I
understand correctly,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.070 align:middle line:84%
that in Nietzsche and other
philosophers like him,

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Freud, Darwin, Marx, even there
is a sense of a turnaround.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the new and
late information regarding

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:44.480 align:middle line:90%
Nietzsche does show that the--

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:51.170 align:middle line:84%
even though he did
originate this allegory

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.190 align:middle line:84%
of the mad man running
through the street saying--

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.620 align:middle line:84%
shouting down, God is
dead, yet, behind it

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
all, he realized the
importance of that concept

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
and hoped that people
would not give it up,

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
even though, because his
own tragic personal life,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:84%
he found he could not
himself affirm it.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't want to
dwell on Nietzsche too much,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.582 align:middle line:90%
but I feel impelled to push--

00:20:27.582 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> He is an important--

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.457 align:middle line:90%
>> --a little further.

00:20:29.457 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
He died, as I recall, insane.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.620 align:middle line:84%
>> And towards the
end of his life,

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:90%
he affirmed the death of God.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And, yet, I think--

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of
Rudolf Steiner, who

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
I regard as one of the great
mystics of the 20th century,

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.840 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book, the
English translation of which

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.900 align:middle line:84%
is "Friedrich Nietzsche,
Fighter for Freedom."

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
There are these many strands
within Nietzsche's thought,

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and almost as though there
are as many Nietzsches

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:08.710 align:middle line:84%
as there are readers, and
very complex, so tremendously

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:middle line:90%
powerful writing.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, one does find
those other strands there.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It strikes me
that in Nietzsche,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:84%
we see something of the
human spirit in our own age,

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:90%
spreading out all--

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good--

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.830 align:middle line:90%
>> --over the place.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> --good point, and, of course,
his championing of strength

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:90%
and the importance of strength.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, he said it
so nebulously or metaphorically

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
that it picked up
by the wrong end,

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
by the Nazis, and
interpreting this

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.600 align:middle line:90%
in terms of physical strength.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, but you're
quite right in coming back

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to him as a seminal
figure and one

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.460 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful and
also complex figures among--

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.260 align:middle line:90%
during the--

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a great irony, that
somebody who is considered

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.710 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual father of
Nazism is also regarded

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
as the spiritual father of
great mystical movements,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:90%
authentically.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.400 align:middle line:84%
There is a fine
knife's edge here,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and maybe it represents
where we stand now, perhaps.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm glad you bring
in that comparison.

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.675 align:middle line:84%
He remains a seminal
figure and also

00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:35.600 align:middle line:90%
a symbolic figure for our time.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.505 align:middle line:84%
Huston, we could be
talking about this forever,

00:22:39.505 --> 00:22:41.252 align:middle line:84%
and I would love
to do that but--

00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:42.775 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:42.775 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
--we're running out
of time right now.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.040 align:middle line:84%
I know we've barely
scratched the surface

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of this important discussion
on the human spirit.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Huston, for being with me.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So good to be
with you, Jeffrey.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:23:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you
for being with us.

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.050 align:middle line:90%
