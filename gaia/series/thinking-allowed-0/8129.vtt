conversations on the leading

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:84%
edge of knowledge and discovery
with psychologist Jeffrey

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Mishlove.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:30.863 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, we'll be exploring
consciousness, evolution,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.430 align:middle line:90%
and human survival.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Dr. Stanislav
Groff, author of numerous books,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.900 align:middle line:84%
including "The Psychology
of the Future,"

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
"The Adventure of Self
Discovery," and "LSD

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Psychotherapy."

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Stan.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for having me.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Your work has ranged
through altered states

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness,
transpersonal psychology,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.710 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual aspects
of psychology.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
particular interest

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
in seeing how this field
of study and experience

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
can be applied to the
very serious problems that

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
are facing humanity now.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>> You see, what happened
in my work is what happened

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:10%
in the work of some
other psychologists,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:10%
which is something that
started as clinical work quite

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:10%
automatically developed into
realms that had some kind

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.422 align:middle line:10%
of social implications.

00:01:33.422 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:10%
This is not something
that I have chosen,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:10%
but something that
people repeatedly

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:10%
sort of discovered and explored
in their own experiences.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you think about
it, humanity for thousands

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
of years, since pretty much the
beginning of recorded history,

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
has faced a series of
continual episodes of violence

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and oppression,
social dislocation,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
mostly created by ourselves.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are two forces
that are certainly significant.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
One is violence, and the other
one, kind of insatiable greed

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.650 align:middle line:84%
seems to be really very
characteristic of human beings.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.110 align:middle line:84%
It's never enough, never
enough money, power, territory,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
status, and kind of this
endless search for more.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And as a consequence
of the greed,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
we see that we're developing
our economy and our industrial

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.820 align:middle line:84%
production at the
expense of our future.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think, in the past,
what was happening is that both

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
greed and violence didn't really
challenge, somehow, nature.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And what happened during
the Industrial Revolution

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.820 align:middle line:84%
is you had this population
explosion and also

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
a tremendous increase
of production,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that somehow these two
elements in human nature

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.470 align:middle line:84%
are really threatening
survival of the human species

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:90%
and also of life on this planet.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course,
thinkers from many,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
many disciplines are
aware of this situation,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.690 align:middle line:84%
have tried to get
a handle on it.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
There are some, I suppose, who
would suggest it's inevitable,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.120 align:middle line:90%
it's biological.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Other people say this
is learned behavior.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
real question is, what
are we to do about it?

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the work that we have
done here on consciousness

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
research and transpersonal
psychology shows some new

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
perspectives, both in terms
of understanding the roots

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
of violence and greed,
but also finding some ways

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of alleviating it.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> And we'll talk about those.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But I want to focus a
little bit on the roots.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you
take issue with people

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.010 align:middle line:84%
who would suggest that
violence and greed

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:90%
are built into us biologically.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Although this is actually
a kind of a dominant theory,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:84%
all those concepts like that,
"Naked Ape," Desmond Morris,

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.360 align:middle line:84%
we came out of the
animal kingdom.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
are the way we are.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Concepts like Paul
MacLean's the triune brain.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have not
just the neocortex,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
but we also have the
mammalian, the reptilian brain,

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
with all kinds of
primitive sort of impulses.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Concepts like biology, Richard
Dawkins' "Selfish Gene,"

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that
violence that we see in humans

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:90%
has no parallel in nature.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
In nature, you see, with
some few exceptions,

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:84%
you see something that's sort
survival, pursuit of food,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
maybe sexual competition,
defending territory.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But you don't find any parallel
to this absolutely useless mass

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
violence that characterizes
the human species.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Genocides and holocausts.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Genocides, Holocaust
concentration camps.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.200 align:middle line:84%
>> These things go way
beyond biological necessity.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So Erich Fromm in his
very wonderful book "Anatomy

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:84%
of Destructiveness" suggested
that human violence is really

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.030 align:middle line:90%
unique.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
He calls it malignant
violence as compared

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.315 align:middle line:84%
to the one that
runs through nature.

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, for the most part,
people don't experience,

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
at least in my lifetime, that
kind of malignant violence.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.570 align:middle line:84%
It's something we know
occurs in human history.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.520 align:middle line:90%
But it seems to be episodic.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, so then the question
is, what is the alternative?

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:10%
And of course, depth
psychology suggested

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:10%
that this uniquely
human violence

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:10%
has something to do
with the difficulties

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:10%
of our development,
of our childhood.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It's to do with interpersonal
dynamics, frustrations,

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:84%
emotional abuse,
rejection, and so on.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's some interesting
studies of political leaders

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
who had unfortunate
childhoods, Hitler.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But still, in my perspective,
these are fairly meek theories

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
in explaining somehow the
depth and the scope of human

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:90%
violence.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And the work non-ordinary
states brought

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:84%
some interesting
additional insights.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when you look at
non-ordinary states visionary

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
states of consciousness,
psychedelic states,

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.680 align:middle line:84%
holotropic states
of consciousness,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.470 align:middle line:84%
people often have images that
are also expressed in religious

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:90%
iconography.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
There's, one might
say, a demonic quality.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, there is
certainly this transpersonal,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:90%
this is archetypal dimension.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Jung talked about these
powerful archetypes

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that can run not just the
individual human psyche

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but even nations, sort
of an historical event.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And the pantheon
of all mythologies

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.780 align:middle line:90%
is always dichotomized.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
the deities and there

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.520 align:middle line:90%
are the restful deities.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I recall reading a paper that
Jung wrote in the 1930s before

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
the onset of the Second World
War in which he noticed that

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.380 align:middle line:84%
many of his patients were
coming to him with imagery

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient
German War God Wotan.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and he actually
predicted that Germany seems

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:90%
to be facing a catastrophe.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:84%
And he believed that the
underlying archetype was

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that of Ragnarok,
which was is twilight

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:84%
of the gods, the
Gotterdammerung,

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and also predicted
that, for that reason,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
it would be ultimately
self-destructive.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're
fundamentally saying, Stan,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
is that if we want to
understand the source,

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
the root cause of this greed
and this violence that's causing

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
so much damage in the world,
that we have to look within

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.425 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And we have to
look very deep.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to look beyond
the kind of model

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
that we have in psychiatry
and psychology, which

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:84%
is based on postnatal
biography, things that happened

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.669 align:middle line:90%
to us after we were born.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.843 align:middle line:84%
And this work,
consciousness research,

00:08:43.843 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:84%
studying non-ordinary
states of consciousness,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
shows that are much,
much deeper sources.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, what
take hold perinatal,

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:90%
related to the trauma of birth.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And then others would be
transpersonal, archetypal,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.210 align:middle line:90%
karmic, and so on.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
>> You point out, for
example, that people can,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
in a non-ordinary
state of consciousness,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
recall and have imagery related
to that period of the birth

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.480 align:middle line:84%
process itself, moving
through the birth canal.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, people get
fixated on a particular stage

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of the birth process which may
feel engulfing or constricting.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, what you see is, when
the process of experiential

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.550 align:middle line:84%
regression reaches birth, you
can see tremendous pockets

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
of aggression opening up,
which has something to do with

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
the fact that for many
hours, the child, the fetus,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
is facing a life-threatening,
very uncomfortable situation

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
that involves, besides
pressures, and pains,

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.440 align:middle line:90%
also choking.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And that triggers
tremendous fury,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:90%
biological, amorphous fury.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So there is a deep
reservoir of aggression

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
that we carry very deep
in the unconscious.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And then depending on what
the post-natal life is,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.510 align:middle line:84%
it either gets more
or less covered.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.710 align:middle line:84%
It creates a kind of
psychological buffering zone.

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Or that whole area
remains open and becomes

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.000 align:middle line:84%
something that shapes
people's behavior

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:90%
and kind of daily experience.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:10%
>> And in holotropic
breath work sessions,

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:10%
which is a form of therapy
that you developed,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:10%
you've had people actually draw
imagery expressing what that

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.310 align:middle line:10%
experience was like.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, both in psychedelic
sessions and in the holotropic

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:10%
breath work, people actually
draw very similar images

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.940 align:middle line:10%
of the perinatal process, where
besides these fetal elements,

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:10%
you have also sort of
powerful archetypal images.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:10%
For example, images
of spiders as kind

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:10%
of symbols of the
devouring feminine,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:10%
so you can see sort
of fetuses being

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:10%
attacked by these tarantulas,
gigantic tarantulas.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:10%
Or some other images
portray, somehow,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.760 align:middle line:10%
of the uterus more
like an octopus that's

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:10%
kind of entangling the fetus.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But the uterine contractions
are our experience

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:90%
as these choking tentacles.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And the beginning of birth
can be experienced, actually,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is what I call cosmic
engulfment, when you can see

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.520 align:middle line:84%
archetypal images of
sort of open mouths,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.830 align:middle line:84%
or you can see something
like maelstrom or quicksand

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.120 align:middle line:90%
sort of engulfing.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Very, very powerful,
potent images.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Stan, we're going to
take a short break.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:03.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:90%
We're back.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Stan, right before
our break, you

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
were describing the
imagery that people

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:84%
will get when they look
deeply into what you call

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:84%
the perinatal stage, or the
period right before birth,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.480 align:middle line:84%
some of the most deeply-embedded
images of our own subconscious,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
images of violence,
strangulation, suffocation.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:26.260 align:middle line:10%
And the interesting
thing, in terms

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.870 align:middle line:10%
of society and
human survival, is

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:10%
that these are some of
the very same images

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:10%
that are associated with
grotesque political events

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.720 align:middle line:10%
that, from time to time,
seem to engulf humanity.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It actually came to me
as a great surprise that,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.610 align:middle line:84%
besides these archetypal
images of spiders, tarantulas,

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
engulfment, and so on,
different stages of birth,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.710 align:middle line:84%
when they are confronted
in experiential regression,

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:84%
are also associated
with, actually,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:00.370 align:middle line:90%
sociopolitical images.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for example, the
identification with a fetus

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.560 align:middle line:84%
who is stuck in the womb when
the cervix is still closed

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.570 align:middle line:84%
can be associated with
images of concentration camps

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
or totalitarian countries
where there is an oppressor

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
or there is a very, very
difficult, oppressive regime.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And situations where
the cervix opens up

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and there is the struggle
in the birth canal

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:84%
are associated with
images of revolutions.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.205 align:middle line:84%
Enough of the oppression
will overthrow the tyrant

00:13:36.205 --> 00:13:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and we will again
breathe freely.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And the moment of birth
frequently associated

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:47.780 align:middle line:84%
with images of end of war or a
successful end of revolution.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, earlier
in our discussion,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.950 align:middle line:84%
I remarked that these sorts
of things aren't so common

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I was thinking
more of my own life.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Because, of course, you
grew up in Czechoslovakia

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
under such a regime.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I experienced both the Nazis,
six years of Nazis, and then,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.020 align:middle line:84%
of course, the Communist
regime, both very oppressive.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And it seems is if humanity
may be engaged in a process

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
right now of digesting these
horrors and coming to terms

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:24.220 align:middle line:84%
with them, that perhaps we have
the possibility of learning

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
enough about ourselves so that
we can prevent these sorts

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of horrible tragedies
from occurring.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But Chris Bache wrote a very
interesting book called "Dark

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Night Early Dawn" in which
he looks at this fact that

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.330 align:middle line:84%
in these perinatal sessions, we
actually confront these horrors

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.340 align:middle line:90%
from the collective unconscious.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And he expressed
sort of this belief

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.050 align:middle line:84%
that maybe when we reach that
level, that we are not just

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
doing personal
therapy, but may be

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.500 align:middle line:84%
clearing the species,
the human species,

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:90%
from all these leftovers.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> You're suggesting,
your work suggests,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:84%
your life's work suggests,
that psychology itself--

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to confront
this level of evil,

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.560 align:middle line:84%
we can't limit ourselves
to post-natal development.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:84%
We have to draw upon the
insights of the world's

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:90%
spiritual traditions.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, you
look at, for example,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.330 align:middle line:84%
amongst other things, the
Tibetan Wheel of Life.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's a
very beautiful example

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
of kind of a recipe for
individual liberation

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.255 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately would be
also collective liberation.

00:15:39.255 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It's part of the
Buddhist tradition.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the idea that the
suffering, the misery in life,

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is caused by primarily
three forces.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
That is ignorance, very,
very profound ignorance

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.930 align:middle line:84%
about our own
nature, about nature

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of reality, which
is called Avidya;

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:84%
then violence,
aggression in our life;

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and the third force would be
lust, desire, and attachment.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And in the Tibetan Thangka,
imagery of the Wheel of Life,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.610 align:middle line:84%
these are symbolized by three
little animals chasing each

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:84%
other and causing the
world to spin around.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's that famous
Wheel of Life held in the grip

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.850 align:middle line:90%
of the Lord of Death.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And it has six locus, or realms,
into which we can be born

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:84%
or reborn, the Gods, the Jealous
Gods, the Asuras, the Hungry

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts, the Human Realm, the
Animal Realm, Hellish Realm,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:10%
And in the middle of
that wheel is a circle

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:10%
that has three animals
representing these three

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:10%
poisons or three forces
that cause suffering,

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:56.710 align:middle line:10%
which is, desire,
lust, and aggression.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> A pig, a snake and
a rooster, as I recall.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But the point of the Tibetan
tradition, if I'm correct,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we, through
discipline, through being

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:84%
able to fearlessly see
ourselves as we are,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
we have the possibility
of achieving

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:22.160 align:middle line:84%
a state of enlightenment where
these instinctual forces are

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.569 align:middle line:90%
transformed.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, the old Buddhism,
the Hinayana Buddhism,

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:10%
had the idea that we should
basically move away from

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:10%
existence altogether
into nirvana.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.310 align:middle line:10%
Whereas what
characterizes Mahayana,

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:10%
such as Vajrayana Buddhism,
is that we can actually

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:10%
reach different
degrees of Nirvana

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:10%
by eliminating or reducing
these three forces.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that
work with non-ordinary states

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
seems to really be very
useful in this regard.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:10%
>> These two schools of
Buddhism you refer to, Hinayana

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:10%
and Mahayana, are sometimes
called the little boat

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:10%
in the big boat, meaning the
little boat IS for the elite

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.770 align:middle line:10%
who can achieve enlightenment.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.560 align:middle line:10%
But the big boat is
for all of humanity.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And what you seem to be
suggesting is that this ancient

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist tradition resonates
somewhat with the modern work

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness research.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it might be part
of a social movement that

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.800 align:middle line:84%
is at this very moment
doing what some people might

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
have thought unimaginable,
transforming the human race.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, actually one of my
favorite workshops is one that

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.330 align:middle line:84%
we do jointly with Jack
Cornfield, which combines,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:84%
holotropic breath
work and Vipassana.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite amazing how these
two approaches, how well they

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.120 align:middle line:90%
complement each other.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Vipassana is a form
of Buddhist meditation,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called
Insight Meditation.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:10%
It's a disciplined
way of looking

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:10%
at the contents
of our own minds,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:10%
which is really what your other
work in holotropic breath work

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:10%
and LSD psychotherapy
also involves,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle line:10%
is a disciplined
approach to encountering

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.620 align:middle line:10%
the depths of the mind.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Buddhism primarily focuses on
the individual transformation.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And my work with psychedelics
and the breath work

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
initially was focusing on
individual transformation.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.950 align:middle line:84%
But the very exciting thing
is the possible social

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.940 align:middle line:90%
implications.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.480 align:middle line:84%
For example, the images
from perinatal sessions

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that we talked about appear
in political caricatures.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
At the time of crisis, when,
for example, two countries

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:84%
are in war with each other,
they portray each other

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.780 align:middle line:84%
using images that are almost
indistinguishable from those

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that people draw
when they confront

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:90%
their own trauma of birth.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is
that we, as a population,

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
as a species, need to get in
touch with, to understand,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that inner spider,
that inner octopus,

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%
that inner demonic creature.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I kind of want to go
like ugh, to own it.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Sam Keen wrote a very
interesting book called "The

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Faces of the Enemy," showing
exactly the same thing,

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
that two countries at war
portray each other using

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same kind of
images, the octopi, the dragons,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
the engulfing monsters,
and so on, the spiders,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and concluded that basically
what's happening here is that

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:84%
this is our own shadow that
is disowned and is projected.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we go and
fight it somewhere else

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.920 align:middle line:84%
rather than confronting
the inner demons.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The Islamic people use
the term Jihad, the holy war,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:11.230 align:middle line:84%
which I think is another phrase
for battling or transforming

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.100 align:middle line:84%
that process inside
of one's self.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, it spills out.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a large
scale social problem.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.230 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, unfortunately,
in our culture we have this

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:10%
extroverted attitude.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:10%
We sort of try to look around,
and identify the problems,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.960 align:middle line:10%
and try to resolve
everything on the outside.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:10%
Where it seems like
the only feasible way

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:10%
of facing the
crisis in the world

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.660 align:middle line:10%
would be large numbers of people
turning inside and humanity

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.290 align:middle line:10%
undergoing a major psycho
spiritual transformation.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems as if the
problems we face are looming

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.160 align:middle line:84%
larger all of the time
because of technology.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:84%
But you in your
lifetime and I have

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:01.280 align:middle line:84%
experienced something of a
consciousness revolution,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.210 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be rising
up from our own depths,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:84%
from our own potentials,
to face that problem.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people are actually in
deep self exploration realize

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:84%
that they are confronting
somehow, in the inner process,

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
exactly the same kinds of
elements that are now becoming

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
a problem in the world.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So they have to confront major
violence within themselves.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
They have to confront this
sort of insatiable greed.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.430 align:middle line:84%
They might confront
certain demonic elements

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:35.660 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And they describe that it
seems to them that there

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:40.490 align:middle line:10%
is like a race in the world.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, if we continue
doing what we have been doing,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.660 align:middle line:84%
just exteriorizing
all the problems,

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that we might not make it, might
eradicate life on the planet.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Stan, I'm going to
have to interrupt you.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Our time is up.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.855 align:middle line:10%
But I know the antidote is in
conversations such as this one.

00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Thanks so much
for being with me.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And beginning
the transformation.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and thank
you for being with us.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.150 align:middle line:90%
