00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome,
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:84%
Today we are going to explore
body, place, and nature

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:90%
in a hypermodern world.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
My guest is Charlene Spretnak,
author of "States of Grace"

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and other books, including "Lost
Goddesses of Early Greece,"

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:84%
"Green Politics," "Spiritual
Dimensions of Green Politics,"

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:90%
and "States of Grace."

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.120 align:middle line:84%
She is on the faculty in
philosophy and religion

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
at the California Institute
of Integral Studies.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Charlene.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
We think of our world as being
a modern world and sometimes

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
a hyper world, but I don't
think people appreciate

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
the extent to which
our lives are totally

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
colored by what you refer
to and other scholars refer

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.430 align:middle line:90%
to as modernity.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Well that's true, and I
discovered that after my last

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:10%
book, "States of Grace,"
because it also addressed crises

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.010 align:middle line:10%
of modernity, but from the
vantage point of what the great

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.768 align:middle line:10%
spiritual traditions
have to add to--

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:10%
or trying to think our
way out of these problems.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.937 align:middle line:10%
>> And so when I was on the
book tour for that book,

00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:10%
I would talk about modernity
and the modern condition

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.870 align:middle line:10%
and the modern world view, and
many people would come up to me

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.820 align:middle line:10%
afterwards and say, that
was really interesting.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
I've never thought
about modernity,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:90%
it was all new to me.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was shocking to
me, because that was 1991.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
We were well into it, we
were 400 years into it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So when I wrote the
"Resurgence of the Real,"

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I realized I needed to put an
appendix in the back called,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
"Modernity is to us
as water to a fish."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:84%
It's just the way we're
raised, it's around us,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.850 align:middle line:84%
we're taught that the
modern condition is simply

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the state the human race
gets to at a certain point,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
but I in that
appendix spelled out

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
all the characteristics
of modernity

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and the modern world
view, which were

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.142 align:middle line:90%
a creation of Western culture--

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Didn't always exist.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:90%
>> --certain decisions.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
We made certain
cultural decisions,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.890 align:middle line:90%
and now we can rethink them.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to stick with this
particular set of assumptions

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.813 align:middle line:84%
or realize that some of it
hasn't worked out very well?

00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:51.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are the fundamental
assumptions of modernity?

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well for one thing, the human
is viewed as Homo economicus.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:84%
That we are essentially
the economic animal.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the core of
the important interactions

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and everything else sort
of forms around that.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And also we have blind
faith and progressivism,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
that the technological fix
is always going to deliver us

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.340 align:middle line:90%
to a better time and place.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's really no
point in studying history

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
or any kind of
oppositional movements

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
that thought there was something
wrong with this, because we

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.330 align:middle line:84%
just have to keep focused
on this trajectory

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.220 align:middle line:90%
and believe it will always--

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So economics, business,
technology, progress,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.450 align:middle line:90%
the rugged individual.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Definitely a focus
on the individual.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Not a very group-oriented
focus, because the autonomous

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:84%
individual was an invention
of the birth of modernity.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
focus in the 18th century

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
and our whole
modern legal system,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and then of course, the
mechanistic worldview,

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
a mechanistic view of the body
from the Scientific Revolution

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.800 align:middle line:90%
in the 16th and 17th century.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Our whole modern
medical system has

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
evolved to fit that
biomechanical image

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.770 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yet you describe these
things, and of course,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.470 align:middle line:84%
we're surrounded by
them, they're endemic.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, it's almost as

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
if your description is a
caricature of what's happening,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:90%
because it is changing.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.450 align:middle line:90%
The system does have, I think--

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.260 align:middle line:84%
and you point out,
it has the capacity

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to laugh at itself, to
alter itself in some ways.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, with lots of
blood, sweat, and tears.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
It took 350 years to challenge
the mechanistic model

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.630 align:middle line:90%
of the body with any success.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I feel that the
characteristics of modernity

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.130 align:middle line:84%
are both intensifying
and being corrected

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:90%
by the corrective effort.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So my book is actually
about the good news.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.050 align:middle line:84%
It's about all the things that
have happened in the 1990s,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.670 align:middle line:84%
since then, just before then,
really that period the closing

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Millennium
where modernity

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:84%
took a very unexpected
turn and a lot

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of the creative and corrective
efforts finally broke through.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:10%
So the focus of the
resurgence of the real

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:10%
puts the emphasis on body,
nature, place, our physicality,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:10%
and how its true
nature poked holes

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:10%
through this etiology of
modernity in recent decades.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Of course, people have been
poking holes in it for a long

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:10%
time, most notably the romantic
movement of the 19th century.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there's a long lineage
of very astute critics who said

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
the mechanistic worldview
is clearly not the truth

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:90%
of our whole totality of being.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We can and need deep
communion with the rest

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of the natural world.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
But these were able
to be marginalized

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
by modernity and
modern schooling

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
until certain things
just fell into position

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.370 align:middle line:90%
in the second half of the 1990s.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
For instance, with regard
to the mechanistic model

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
of the body and
modern medicine, a lot

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
of people for the
previous 20, 30 years

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
had been trying to
say, look, there's

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
something to these alternative
and complementary therapies.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.920 align:middle line:84%
There's something more
going on than just the body

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:90%
as a machine.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> But the medical propaganda
establishment to delegitimize

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:90%
those areas is just enormous.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they could
cast dispersions,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly, the AMA
was the advisor to the medical

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:90%
insurance industry.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And so they always said,
don't pay any of those quacks,

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.285 align:middle line:84%
just give up on us
all the business,

00:06:39.285 --> 00:06:41.660 align:middle line:84%
we're the grown-ups here, and
so that worked pretty well.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's Interesting how they
take a word like quack and use

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it with such effectiveness
against what we now know to be

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.540 align:middle line:84%
many legitimate
forms of healing.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the way that's finally
been accepted is something that

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:58.415 align:middle line:90%
none of us could have predicted.

00:06:58.415 --> 00:06:59.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:06:59.215 --> 00:07:01.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And when the Clinton
administration in the first

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.840 align:middle line:84%
term tried to get through
managed competition--

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:84%
not even a single-payer system,
but was defeated in trying

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to get managed competition by
the medical insurance industry,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.510 align:middle line:84%
the medical insurance industry
then said to Washington, look,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:90%
we can handle this.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.033 align:middle line:84%
We know the prices
are skyrocketing

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and the government can't
afford to pay this anymore,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
but we can take care of
this with no regulation,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.610 align:middle line:90%
so just leave it to us.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:10%
And at that point, they
pushed aside the AMA

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.110 align:middle line:10%
and took a good hard look at
25 years of accumulated studies

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.960 align:middle line:10%
on complementary and
alternative therapies,

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:10%
and they not only begrudgingly
started paying for them,

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:10%
they started urging their
subscribers to use them.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:10%
And they pushed the FDA to
reclassify acupuncture needles

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:10%
out of the experimental
category into a category

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:10%
in which licensed
practitioners can use them

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.733 align:middle line:10%
in general practice.

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Because they saw that there
could be an economic benefit.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Because particularly when the
alternative or complementary

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:10%
therapies are matched up with
certain illnesses and ailments,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:10%
the results are
very efficacious.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:10%
Cheaper, as you say, they have
better patient follow-through,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.730 align:middle line:10%
they follow the whole
cycle of treatment

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:10%
because they're less invasive.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So right away in 1995, they
start really pushing this

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:90%
with the American public.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was shown-- one
of my students brought

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:84%
in a newsletter from
Blue Shield that goes out

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.120 align:middle line:84%
across the country
with the bills,

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.419 align:middle line:84%
and it urged everyone,
all the subscribers

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:35.664 align:middle line:84%
to learn vipassana meditation,
mindfulness meditation.

00:08:35.664 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
It didn't use the
word vipassana,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.122 align:middle line:90%
that would be too foreign.

00:08:38.122 --> 00:08:40.023 align:middle line:84%
But it said, learn the
mindfulness meditation

00:08:40.023 --> 00:08:41.690 align:middle line:84%
techniques, it lowers
the blood pressure

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.559 align:middle line:84%
and it went on and listed
everything it does,

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.142 align:middle line:84%
but the books at the end of the
article were all in vipassana.

00:08:46.142 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So I never thought I would
see that in my lifetime.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It does represent a
very significant shift.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's coming
from Blue Shield.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And so starting,
then, in 1995, what

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.960 align:middle line:84%
we have is an experiential
wave of people

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.510 align:middle line:84%
at the grassroots
getting acupuncture

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:84%
or some other kind of
alternative therapy,

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.628 align:middle line:84%
and they might say, well, I
don't know the theory behind it

00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and understand why it
worked, but it works.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So I guess the body must be some
kind of energy system instead

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:90%
of just a bio machine.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's extremely
significant,

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
because for 350
years, nothing had

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
been able to budge the
mechanistic model of the body.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, the medical
establishment

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:84%
has sort of been dragged
kicking and screaming

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.527 align:middle line:90%
into recognizing this.

00:09:36.527 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And the medical journals
have these articles

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:84%
saying, look, here are the basic
10 complementary therapies,

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.813 align:middle line:84%
you have to know what they are,
you better know what illnesses

00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:46.730 align:middle line:84%
they particularly are
good for, because you're

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:84%
going to have to be
working with them.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's a huge sea change.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One could even go so far
as to say that the field

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
of medicine is now leading
the way in terms of one

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:84%
of the vanguard cultural
movements looking at a more

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.410 align:middle line:84%
holistic perspective,
incorporating consciousness.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well I suppose so.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.505 align:middle line:90%
They're reluctant rebels.

00:10:06.505 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, of course
there are still

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people within the field
who oppose it tooth and nail,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.360 align:middle line:90%
but it's happening.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Who would have thought?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And ironically, I would
have imagined it would be sort

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of the academics-- the
universities leading the way,

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:84%
but I think they're still
behind many, many other areas.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some of the med schools
now have courses educating

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.305 align:middle line:84%
these students on
these therapies.

00:10:31.305 --> 00:10:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
important to point out,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.420 align:middle line:84%
modernity happened
also for reasons.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:90%
There were cultural antecedents.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:84%
It was, in effect,
a rebellion against

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
the dogmatic
authoritarian control

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.135 align:middle line:84%
of the theocratic
establishment, in effect.

00:10:48.135 --> 00:10:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to go back to the
history of where modernity came

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
from, it did arise at the
end of the Middle Ages,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and it happened
with a succession

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
of four movements which became
foundational for the way

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:90%
we think.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll come to
those, Charlene,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.480 align:middle line:90%
after we take a break.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.802 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:11:07.802 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll be right back.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:17.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to
"Thinking Allowed,"

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm your host, Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is
Charlene Spretnak,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:84%
author of "The
Resurgence of the Real."

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at body, place,
and nature in a hypermodern

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.700 align:middle line:84%
And Charlene, you
were describing

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
right before our
break this transition

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.950 align:middle line:84%
from a medieval world
view to a modern world

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:41.300 align:middle line:84%
view that took place about
400 or 500 years ago.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned there
were four primary qualities

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:90%
of that transition.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.850 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a shame that
schoolchildren apparently

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:10%
are not apprised of
this, because you

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:10%
can see how our
thinking came out

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:10%
of this cultural
succession of movements.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.525 align:middle line:10%
The first was
renaissance humanism.

00:12:02.525 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And as you mentioned, there
was a great impulse to get out

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.850 align:middle line:10%
from under the control of the
kind and the church who really

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.800 align:middle line:10%
had everything wrapped up.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> To the extent that Galileo
was imprisoned for just

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.130 align:middle line:84%
for looking through his
telescope and reporting what he

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:90%
saw.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And actually, it's
quite interesting

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
Copernican Revolution, too.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But let me start
with the first one.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.090 align:middle line:84%
With the Renaissance
humanism, they

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
wanted to get some distance
from that control of the Church,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and so they said,
let's look back

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to the Greeks, that's really
the earliest source of Western

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.825 align:middle line:84%
thought, this secular
tradition with the Greeks.

00:12:44.825 --> 00:12:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were swinging,
but as you can see,

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
in all four of these movements,
I'm going to talk about

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:58.110 align:middle line:84%
the reactive swing
was a little too far.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
A lot of value got dismissed
pretty aggressively.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And so the motto "Man is
the measure of all things"

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
replaced the medieval
cosmological sense

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
of the creation as a whole
and our part in that.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
And then with the second
one, the Reformation,

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther, of
course, correctly

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.740 align:middle line:84%
pointed out that Rome was
correctly selling indulgences,

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:84%
and there was also a push
of the new nationalism.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Why are we under the
control of the Italians?

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.790 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:37.165 align:middle line:10%
>> Let's just-- so for benefit
of our viewers who may not

00:13:37.165 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:10%
know, what is an indulgence?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can tell you
that as a Cradle Catholic

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.070 align:middle line:90%
as they call us.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it's a practice
whereby you could do good deeds

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
or say a certain
amount of prayers

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
very deeply and
contemplatively and then

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
receive a blessing such that you
would get sprung from Purgatory

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:90%
a little earlier.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, everybody figured
that unless you were a saint,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.900 align:middle line:84%
you weren't going
straight to Heaven.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.275 align:middle line:84%
But if you weren't really bad,
you weren't going to Hell,

00:14:08.275 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
and so the Catholics had this
middle ground, Purgatory,

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.025 align:middle line:84%
where you had to
spend some time in it,

00:14:13.025 --> 00:14:14.990 align:middle line:90%
and it was an unpleasant place.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So you could sort of knock
off some of your sentence

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:90%
by these good deeds or prayers.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
But in that period,
it became more of a--

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you give a thank
you to the priest

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:90%
and in the form of some cash.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was, of course,
totally corrupt and against

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
the spirit of it, and Luther
was so right to object to that.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:44.420 align:middle line:84%
But the Reformation in the
1500s also put a new emphasis

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
on the individual which was
not present in Western culture

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
before, because
he said, you don't

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.490 align:middle line:84%
need these priests and nuns
and communion of saints.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that's important
is the direct relationship

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.890 align:middle line:90%
between the individual and God.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that became another
piece in the mosaic that was--

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's interesting, because
we took that and turned it

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:84%
into a secular form
of individualism,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.800 align:middle line:84%
whereas it sounds as if what
Luther was saying was very much

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:84%
akin to what the ancient
gnostics were saying,

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:90%
something profoundly spiritual.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.770 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it's
the movement that

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.500 align:middle line:84%
came just after that, the
Scientific Revolution,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.390 align:middle line:84%
that the world is just
dead matter working

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
on mechanistic
principles, God sort of

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:84%
gave it a little
push at the beginning

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to get the universe going,
but other than that,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.170 align:middle line:84%
it works like a clockwork, and
we can have dominion over it

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:90%
by learning these laws.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So the combination of the
emphasis on an individual

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and the mechanistic world
view in the 18th century

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
became the application of
this scientific worldview

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to all our institutions.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So if Protestantism ever had
a chance to become an authentic

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.540 align:middle line:84%
gnostic movement, it
was blown at that point.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.450 align:middle line:10%
The different versions of
it moving out from Luther

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.080 align:middle line:10%
were more extreme than he
was on just every count.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:10%
The Virgin Mary, everything,
and making a direct break--

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.840 align:middle line:10%
radical break,
things intensified

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:10%
as they do in revolutions.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:10%
So then we had, as I say, the
scientism in the 18th century.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything had
to be mechanistic.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Educational systems, garden
design in 18th century France

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is that awful grid
whipping nature

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
into shape with those
formal grid gardens,

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
and to focus on the
autonomous individual.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And this becomes so
central in modernity,

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:50.510 align:middle line:84%
that's why in modern novels, the
hero always has to leave home,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:53.590 align:middle line:84%
place, clan, the
bioregion, religion,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
and go to the city where he
can be completely anonymous

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:90%
and an autonomous individual.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But usually he returns
back home at some point.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Certainly a lot of the writers
did, I was going to say,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.305 align:middle line:84%
who would go to the
cities and then come back

00:17:12.305 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:90%
to write about their place.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
So these are the qualities,
then, the scientism,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the individuality, the humanism,
and the birth of cities

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:90%
and a loss of community.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a good side
to everything you said.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, individuality,
but individualism

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.745 align:middle line:84%
means the most
important thing is not

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:37.370 align:middle line:84%
that you are embedded
in relationships,

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.400 align:middle line:84%
but rather that you imagine that
you're this autonomous being

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
cut off, which is not the way
it works in this universe.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Everything's very
suddenly interconnected.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.530 align:middle line:90%
So it's the escape.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.660 align:middle line:84%
The modern theme is
the escape from nature,

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
the escape from religion,
the escape from family.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.065 align:middle line:90%
>> The escape from our bodies.

00:17:55.065 --> 00:17:55.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:17:55.865 --> 00:17:56.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:84%
We get caught up in a world
of ideas, of intellect.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.530 align:middle line:84%
What's important
is the mind and it

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
has sort of this dragged
around by this dumb body.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.807 align:middle line:84%
I mean, kids get that
message rather early

00:18:07.807 --> 00:18:08.765 align:middle line:90%
on in modern schooling.

00:18:08.765 --> 00:18:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Now I have to say as a child
of the '60s, of course,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.240 align:middle line:84%
the whole
consciousness movement,

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.510 align:middle line:84%
the psychedelic movement of
the '60s, the protest movement,

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.510 align:middle line:84%
all of those things
were to a large degree

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:90%
a rebellion against modernity.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That is one of the corrective
movements that's part of this

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:90%
lineage.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was there myself,
and well do I remember how

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
anti-intellectual it was because
we felt that this rationalism,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.340 align:middle line:84%
this march of words across the
page couldn't possibly express

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:84%
all the complexity
and subtlety of being.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But because of the strong
anti-intellectual tenor

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:55.160 align:middle line:84%
to that movement, we completely
missed our predecessors.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Coleridge, for instance,
was a great philosopher

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:58.880 align:middle line:90%
of the romantics.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.180 align:middle line:84%
He had a lot to say that
we really could have used,

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.490 align:middle line:84%
but it was as if we were
reinventing the wheel.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:84%
We really didn't understand
a lot of our predecessors

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.560 align:middle line:84%
except Blake was
quoted here and there.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.750 align:middle line:10%
>> And without that
self-understanding,

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.620 align:middle line:10%
many revolutionary movements or
even evolutionary movements end

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.550 align:middle line:10%
up taking on many of the very
characteristics that they think

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.985 align:middle line:10%
they're rebelling against.

00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, they're often co-opted,
and they would have more

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:10%
strength if, for instance, we
had realized that behind us we

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:10%
had the critique of the
modernist philosophers

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:10%
and poets.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.950 align:middle line:10%
The arts and crafts movement.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:40.700 align:middle line:10%
William Morris, Ruskin,
the cosmological schools

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:10%
of painting at the
turn of the century,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:10%
Gandhi's constructive
movement, all of those

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:10%
specifically critiqued
these assumptions

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:10%
of a modern
mechanistic world view.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You also, if I
understand you correctly,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.620 align:middle line:84%
equate modernity with a
patriarchal worldview.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some scholars have
noticed that in that shift

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:84%
around the time of the
Scientific Revolution,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
there was, as one of the
professors called it,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
a hyper-masculinizing
of thought.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.440 align:middle line:84%
So the older relational sense of
the creation the medieval time

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
was replaced with people
who could successfully

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:84%
keep emotion out of any
thought, as if you could.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know now the
studies on the brain,

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:84%
there's a very subtle
emotional response

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.130 align:middle line:84%
before every thought
that's perceived

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.700 align:middle line:84%
below the level
of consciousness.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:84%
So what emerged to
be the proper way

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.930 align:middle line:84%
to behave in the
public sphere is

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:84%
the way that fit
more comfortably

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
with the masculine
socialization.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:10%
So that's why the
modern world is

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:10%
said to be a good
fit for most men,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:10%
and I discovered that
when I sent my book

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.780 align:middle line:10%
proposal to an old
friend from college who's

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.720 align:middle line:10%
a vice president of a university
hospital, and in his own words,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:10%
I'm a bureaucrat
and a damn good one.

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:11.600 align:middle line:10%
And so I sent the book proposal
with all these critiques

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:10%
of modernity and the
corrective movements,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:10%
and he just hit the ceiling.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.430 align:middle line:90%
He said, what is wrong with you?

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.540 align:middle line:90%
Critiquing modernity?

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what-- this is who
we are, it's what we are.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And some people's identity is
very closely wrapped up in it.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the critique
is very uncomfortable,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.370 align:middle line:84%
but we need to go in some
different directions.

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:90%
It's still a big fight to win.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It reminds me, I suppose, of
the scene in the movie "Gandhi"

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
where a British officer says,
what do you mean give up India?

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:90%
India is British.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But modernity is falling
apart of its own course.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the corrections
to which you point out--

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:84%
the resurgence of the
real, of body, of nature,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:02.140 align:middle line:84%
these things are happening
in ways that are amazing us.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And with regard to
place, for instance,

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:84%
modern international
law is finally

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.110 align:middle line:90%
changing after a very long time.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the political
theory of the modern state

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.390 align:middle line:84%
did not in any way recognize
the ancient nations,

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:90%
people rooted in place.

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And the definition of
a nation is an indigenous

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.960 align:middle line:84%
or longstanding cultural entity,
but then the modern state was

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:84%
invented after 1648, the
Treaty of Westphalia--

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> The geopolitical entity.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And they could draw
those boundaries

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:84%
right down the middle of
an ancient nation or--

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And often did.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --absorb them-- many times.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And the count now is that
there are 5,000 ancient nations

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
in the world
unrepresented and have

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
no legal standing because
they were surrounded

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:90%
by these modern states.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Well Charlene, our
time is up for now.
