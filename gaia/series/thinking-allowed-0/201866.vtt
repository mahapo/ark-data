00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jeffrey Mishlove.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are going to
examine the human future.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
As we approach the
year 2000, what

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
are some of the novel features
of our contemporary culture

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:84%
that are likely to become
dominant in future society?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.850 align:middle line:84%
With me is Terrence
McKenna, a specialist

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.940 align:middle line:84%
in shamanistic cultures
and hallucinogenic plants

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:90%
and drugs.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Terrence is the co-author
with his brother Dennis

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
of "The Invisible Landscape:
Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Ching," and also, "Psilocybin:
The Magic Mushroom Growers

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Guide."

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:84%
In addition, he is a founder
of Botanical Dimensions,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
a non-profit
organization devoted

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:84%
to preserving hallucinogenic
plants as used

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
by native peoples
throughout the world.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's also the author
of "Time Wave Zero,"

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:90%
a computer software package.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Terrence.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be here, Jeffrey.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you're a
specialist really in the past

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient past, prehistoric
past of shamanistic cultures.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Of course, ancient
peoples, shamans,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and other ancient
peoples have always

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:90%
tempted to look at the future.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Today, there are many, many
scenarios about the future,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and the one thing that
seems to be certain

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
is that the future
will contain surprises

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.350 align:middle line:84%
that no matter how
much we attempt

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to predict what
the future will be,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
there will always be
unexpected things.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.200 align:middle line:84%
I think you have a unique
perspective on the future

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
since your studies take you
so deeply into the past,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and I wonder what some of
the major features that you

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.460 align:middle line:84%
delineate in our present
and our past society

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
are that may tend to
surprise us or surprise

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.945 align:middle line:84%
conventional theorists
about the future.

00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first, let me say,
you make a valid point.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:10%
My ordinary concern
is shamanism,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:10%
which is usually thought of
as an archaic or anhistorical

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.030 align:middle line:10%
phenomenon.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
However, in my looking at
the shamanistic phenomena,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I've discovered that shamans
themselves, as you also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, have a deep concern
with seeing into the future,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
with having a feeling for
the course of development

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.900 align:middle line:84%
of the society in which
they are embedded.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And strangely enough,
my own career somewhat

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.040 align:middle line:84%
paralleled that model as I was
a student at Eric Jantsch, who

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.360 align:middle line:84%
was one of the great forecasters
of the last 10 years.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Systems theorist.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Systems theorist, exactly,
and he was very concerned

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:84%
to model the future with a
degree of realism that had

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:90%
previously not been possible.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:84%
He taught me that
the way to do this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
is to concentrate on the
novel and the unexpected.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.070 align:middle line:84%
As you point out,
much of the future

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.840 align:middle line:84%
will be, in fact, characterized
by factors that are presently

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:90%
unpredictable.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
How then by stretching our own
definition of what is currently

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.110 align:middle line:84%
at the cutting
edge of society can

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:84%
we anticipate these
future event systems?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:84%
My own approach to this has been
to try to concretize or locate

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
areas of influence that
seem to me, while very

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
seminal in the
present situation,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.077 align:middle line:84%
probably fated to grow and
flower over the next 25 years.

00:03:45.077 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think it's
interesting that you mentioned

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Eric Jantsch.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:90%
He wrote a book.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was called
"Design for Evolution."

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> In that book, I was very
interested in how a man of his

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
scientific credentials as a
systems theorist took a close

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.560 align:middle line:84%
look at the New Age movement and
things, such as Kundalini yoga,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and began to examine how we
might begin to as a society

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
look at developing Kundalini
to develop our own evolution

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.195 align:middle line:90%
biologically and as a species.

00:04:16.195 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, he was an
extremely broad thinker.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Not only a fine scientist, but
a music critic, philosopher,

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:90%
what have you.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
A point that he was
always very much

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
concerned to make to
me about the future

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:84%
was much of the future is
in place in the present.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
A typical residential
street of today

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
will look pretty much
as it looks today

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
30 years from now barring
major catastrophic changes

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:90%
in society.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
A curious thing about history is
how much momentum it does have.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, it is
possible to isolate

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
forces which are creating change
for major forces, which I will

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:90%
enumerate and discuss for you.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
The four that, I
think, are probably

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
among the most important
are, first of all, feminism.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Feminism is a tremendously
underestimated force

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.900 align:middle line:84%
viewed in the present
context primarily

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:90%
as a woman's concerning.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The understanding has not yet
percolated throughout society

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that the advancement of women
is a program vitally connected

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to the survival of human
beings as a species.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this is
simply that institutions

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
take on the character of the
atoms which compose them,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and what we are most menaced
by in the 20th century

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:90%
are dehumanized institutions.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.270 align:middle line:84%
If women played a major role in
policy formation and execution

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
on the part of
these institutions,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I think they would have a far
more benign and ecologically

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.060 align:middle line:90%
sensitive kind of character.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So I see feminism not as a
kind of war between the sexes

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
or any of these
stereotypic images,

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
but as actually a kind
of effort to shift

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
the ratios of our
emphasis that is expressed

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:90%
through our institutions.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> In other words, you're not
looking so much at whether

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
women get more voting rights
or whether they get more women

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.095 align:middle line:84%
placed in high
positions in government,

00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
but rather whether our
institutions have more

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:90%
of a nurturing quality.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
It isn't even
really about women.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
It's about femininity,
injecting femininity

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
into our decision making
process and our social policy.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, the most
obvious way to do this

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is to bring women
into the process,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
but that isn't necessarily
how it should be done.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a catch phrase
now that's going around a lot

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
in business circles,
high tech, high touch.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
That seems to embody this
notion of paying attention

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to human feelings and
caring about people as we

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
develop a more technologically
oriented society.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, although, I'm suspicious
of that having seen several

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
American revolutions turned
into advertising slogans.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid this may be an
effort to co-opt the really

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:84%
volcanic energy that
feminism could bring

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
to the social
restructuring effort,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
but feminism is only
one of these novel areas

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
that are injecting
change into our lives.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Why don't we list the others?

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, perhaps, we
can look at how they

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:90%
interrelate with each other.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for example,
cybernetics is certainly

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:17.380 align:middle line:84%
a major area where we
could spend some time.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Space flight, I don't think
you would get a lot of argument

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:84%
from people that
is going to have

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.380 align:middle line:90%
a major impact on our lives.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Then perhaps in a more
controversial vein

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and along the lines of
my own special interests,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
I think hallucinogenic
plants and the pushing back

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of the frontiers of the mind,
the cataloging of ever more

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:84%
exotic states of
experience through the use

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of hallucinogenic drugs, aerobic
exercise, vitamin therapy,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
what have you is going to
be very, very important.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Seen as an amalgam, what
these things seem to imply

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we are really sweeping
toward the climax of 1,000 year

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
old civilization, a
civilization that began,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:84%
I suppose you could
say, with the rise

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
of medieval scholasticism,
which then transformed itself

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.410 align:middle line:84%
into proto modern science, which
then became modern science,

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and then modern philosophy.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
We are really sweeping
toward the culmination

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Western contribution
to the story of mankind,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and what will that
contribution be?

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:45.000 align:middle line:84%
It could well be a devastating
species exterminating

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:84%
thermonuclear war, or it
could be the culmination

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and completion of
the ideals that we

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:90%
inherited from the Greeks.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
How we balance historical
forces against the need

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.310 align:middle line:84%
to evolve consciousness is going
to decide how the tale is told.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
things that I named,

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.330 align:middle line:84%
feminism, cybernetics,
consciousness expansion,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:84%
space flight, these are
all different approaches

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:26.070 align:middle line:84%
toward the notion of expanding
our frontiers organizationally,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
geographically,
informationally, consciously.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The expansion of frontiers
is the very essence

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.965 align:middle line:84%
of a continuing
humane human future.

00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You used the word balance
a little earlier in a pivotal

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:84%
way, and the four elements
that you've mentioned strike me

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:90%
as being rather balanced.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Spaceflight and cybernetics seem
to be expanding the frontiers

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%
of science and technology.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet, when we look at the
inner exploration suggested

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
by the rise of feminism
and the return, or revival,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.298 align:middle line:84%
or reenergizing of
hallucinogenic drugs

00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and other features of the
consciousness movement,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that suggests an expansion
of the inner frontiers.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me
ultimately that, if we

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
are to survive the threats
that now stand poised

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
above our planet, that
balance has to be essential,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can't go too
far either internally

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
or externally without
some balancing features.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I think that's
a very good point.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the entire
lethal dimension

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:10%
to our cultural
dilemma can be laid

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:10%
at the feet of a burgeoning
scientific capability that

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:10%
developed at the expense of a
concomitant ethical capacity.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are not
going to go to the stars

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
as Republicans and
Democrats, communists,

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:90%
and free marketeers.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We are not going to go to the
stars as male chauvinists.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:08.610 align:middle line:84%
Nor are we going to go to the
stars as uninformed clods.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.630 align:middle line:84%
All of these various
characteristics and ways

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:84%
of being are dross that
the historical experience

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century is going
to either burn away from us

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:90%
or burn us with.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.960 align:middle line:84%
We have actually created
a self-limiting situation

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.320 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones who have boxed
ourselves into this dilemma,

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.720 align:middle line:84%
and we must now be
the ones who have

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
the cultural and
intellectual wherewithal

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to take command of the
situation and to navigate out

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
of this cul-de-sac without
wrecking the planet,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
without betraying
our ethical heritage

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
of some several thousand years.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Balance is going to
be essential to this.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:84%
A sense of openness
to possibility,

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.330 align:middle line:84%
a sense of the true
strangeness of the situation

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:90%
in which we find ourselves.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.070 align:middle line:10%
>> It strikes me that as
we move into the future,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.130 align:middle line:10%
as we move into the
next millennia, perhaps,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:10%
the really novel feature that
might emerge is as a culture,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:10%
as a global culture, that
we will be forced, I think,

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.130 align:middle line:10%
to take responsibility for
ourselves on this planet

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:10%
in a way that we haven't
previously been forced to do.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Because we've always
had room to expand,

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
room to exploit the
environment and ourselves.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
We're running out
of room for that,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:90%
so we must be responsible.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, this is the
century in which the chickens

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:45.840 align:middle line:90%
come home to roost.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.700 align:middle line:84%
All the profligate processes
of metal extraction,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.910 align:middle line:84%
and subjugation of
native populations,

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and land clearing
in the tropics,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
that pot latch
mentality must now

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.460 align:middle line:84%
give way to a more resource
conserving state of mind.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Or we will be, quite
simply, doomed,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very much
up on humanity.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.570 align:middle line:84%
But I'm very concerned
about the role

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
that the United States is
to play in this future.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, if
resource management

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to be an important
factor in the future,

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
then the Japanese are out
in front of all of us.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, if not having
committed resources

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to an obsolete infrastructure
is going to have an impact,

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:middle line:84%
then certainly, the Chinese
have a leg up on all of us.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Did you know there are less
than 1,000 private automobiles

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:90%
in China?

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Can you conceive
of the leap forward

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that can be made if you
could go from the wooden cart

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.610 align:middle line:84%
to the space ship without
committing yourself

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to 50 years of highway
to building, and gas

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
stations, and
petroleum extraction,

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.555 align:middle line:90%
and this sort of thing?

00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You have a remarkable talent
here for seeing the positive

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
side of a nation of a billion
people living in what we would

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.400 align:middle line:90%
think of as destitute poverty.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't have cars, because
the per capita income in China

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:90%
is about $250 a year.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think Marshall
McLuhan pointed out that any

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
technology put in place
is extremely difficult

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to dislodge, and
that is our problem.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We went for the
automobiles so completely

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.800 align:middle line:84%
that it will now
be a major effort

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
at cultural restructuring
to leave it behind.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese have
no such problem.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I think it was Freeman Dyson
or perhaps Gerard O'Neil,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
who said no technology
should be put in place that

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
has a foreseeable obsolescence.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
This was his argument
against nuclear power,

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
an excellent point.

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We should not commit ourselves
to any course of action whose

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
end state can be foreseen.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have
to commit ourselves

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to this kind of conscious, open
system, non-equilibrium future

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that futurists, like Jantsch,
and West Churchman, and others,

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.925 align:middle line:84%
have so eloquently
described in their work.

00:16:29.925 --> 00:16:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk for a bit about
the role of hallucinogens

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:90%
in the future.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I think most people would
agree that the marvelous decade

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.480 align:middle line:84%
of the 1960s, which
seemed to have awakened

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:84%
so many people to
new possibilities,

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.840 align:middle line:84%
was inextricably linked
with the use of LSD

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.673 align:middle line:84%
and other hallucinogens
at that period.

00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to
me that, today, this

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
is not talked about very much.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the few people who
are willing to look at the role

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.640 align:middle line:84%
that hallucinogens may
have played at that time.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.740 align:middle line:90%
How do you see hallucinogens?

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
Do you imagine, for example,
that a billion Chinese will

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.059 align:middle line:90%
return to--

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Using LSD?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:90%
No, it isn't quite like that.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:10%
I think whatever we may say
about the way hallucinogens

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.369 align:middle line:10%
were introduced into
American society in the '60s,

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:10%
I think that has now
become a dead horse

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:10%
and that we are looking at a
much different sort of problem.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:38.430 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that psychology,
the science whose perfection

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.840 align:middle line:84%
we are most in need of,
because our whole problem is

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.760 align:middle line:84%
that we do not communicate
with each other.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We do not understand
our own motivations.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
We are waiting on psychology
literally to save our necks,

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and governments are repressing
the major tools that promise

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.270 align:middle line:90%
major advances in psychology.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I may represent only
a faction of opinion,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:13.050 align:middle line:84%
but it is my opinion that the
hallucinogenic plants and drugs

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:19.410 align:middle line:84%
are to psychology what Galileo's
telescope was to astronomy.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
that the church

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
was unable to suppress
the telescope,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.500 align:middle line:84%
but the state has
had immense success

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:90%
in suppressing hallucinogens.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not speaking
of keeping it out

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of the hands of high schoolers
and college students.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about keeping it
out of the hands of research

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
pharmacologists.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
Science feels free to
investigate any area that

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.170 align:middle line:84%
concerns it, areas of our
interpersonal relating,

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
our sexuality, the
effects of automobile

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
crashes on human bodies
studied through using monkeys.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.510 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is sacred.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.320 align:middle line:84%
However, when it comes
to allowing scientists

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
to study the effect of
hallucinogenic compounds

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
on brain function and
psychology, a great wall,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.540 align:middle line:90%
a great barrier is raised.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
I think it signifies
the fear really

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.520 align:middle line:84%
that the establishment has
of unleashing the creativity

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
and vitality that it senses
to be tied up in these things.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The very decade that you
mentioned was the last decade,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:84%
I think, when Americans have
this feeling of an open ended,

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:90%
hopeful, transcendent future.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Ever since the 1960s,
we've been given shortages,

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:52.140 align:middle line:84%
limited resources,
voluntary simplicity,

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.550 align:middle line:84%
and a host of other notions
that boil down to repression.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're suggesting that the
legal restrictions are perhaps

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.290 align:middle line:84%
a temporary aberration and that
the exploration of the human

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.310 align:middle line:84%
mind through hallucinogens
or other means might get us

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:15.160 align:middle line:84%
in touch with a vast resource
within ourselves that we seem

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to have lost touch with a
little bit as a culture.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, if you
contrast the state of modern

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:26.470 align:middle line:84%
astrophysics with astronomy
as it was practiced in 1530,

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I think you can feel the
kind of paradigm shift that

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm suggesting.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:90%
We know nothing about the mind.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
There are a few theories,
Freud, Young, Reich, so forth,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.800 align:middle line:84%
But these are just guesses
tossed into the unknown.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Yet, in principle, the
mind need not be a mystery.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It's simply that the more
complex objects in nature

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.350 align:middle line:90%
yield their secrets last.

00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
We understood falling
lead balls long before we

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:90%
understood dead drops of water.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
We understood drops of water
long before plastic polymers.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.320 align:middle line:84%
The mind, the brain
will yield, but it

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
will yield to a
different set of tools

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:16.995 align:middle line:84%
than the ones we
have been applying.

00:21:16.995 --> 00:21:20.170 align:middle line:84%
>> As a philosopher, or at
least a person who asks a lot

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:25.180 align:middle line:84%
of questions, I wonder if the
ultimate nature of the mind is

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
really knowable any more than
the ultimate nature of matter.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
It seems as if, in some
senses, as our scientists

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and physicists today probe
the ultimate nature of matter,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.930 align:middle line:84%
they begin asking questions
that sound more and more

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.800 align:middle line:90%
theological.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.720 align:middle line:84%
We get that way, too, with
people who look at the mind,

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:84%
particularly people who
explore hallucinogens.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we can do
a great deal, though,

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
without having ultimate
knowledge of something.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.270 align:middle line:84%
As you yourself said, we
have no ultimate knowledge

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:84%
of what matter is
or electricity.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we light our
cities with electricity.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We transform matter any way
we wish, so I agree with you.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:84%
The mind is inherently
mysterious if nothing else

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.370 align:middle line:84%
girdles theorem will protect
it from being understood,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that mind cannot
understand mind.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I think brain, which
is the receiver of mind,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.280 align:middle line:84%
the stage upon which mind acts,
the magic marionette, if you

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
will, there is much
to be learned there.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
That is, in fact, the great
frontier of materialism

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.370 align:middle line:90%
strangely enough.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, as you look at
the future Terrence with

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.020 align:middle line:10%
your special lenses that
really are unique to yourself,

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:10%
where do you see the realm
of religion evolving?

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we are rapidly
growing into what I call

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
a religion of the imagination,
where we transcend individual

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:05.440 align:middle line:84%
archetypes and begin instead
to realize that the mystery can

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:84%
take any form, and that a higher
religion is a religion then

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:84%
which dispenses with
the symbolic forms,

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:17.680 align:middle line:84%
the presentational
modes of the mystery,

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and concentrates on the mystery
itself as a kind of ineffable

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.350 align:middle line:84%
center of being that
constellates everything around

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.415 align:middle line:90%
it to have meaning.

00:23:30.415 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> This would
require, obviously,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.465 align:middle line:90%
a dropping away then of dogma.

00:23:34.465 --> 00:23:38.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, I think
dogma has served as ill.

00:23:38.005 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.870 align:middle line:90%
How ill is hard to say.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.660 align:middle line:84%
But I think, for
instance, I mean, the case

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.840 align:middle line:84%
could be made that it
got us to this point.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I think it was H.G.
Wells, who said

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
history is a race between
education and disaster.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think we are
in the homestretch.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:90%
We are neck and neck.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.610 align:middle line:84%
It is too close to
call, and we must not

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:90%
take our eye off the ball.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.150 align:middle line:84%
It is going to take the
best effort of all of us

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to bring to birth the kind of
transcendental human future

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.820 align:middle line:84%
that we all sense so pregnantly
near the surface of things.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It is not far away.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:84%
It is here it is now, if
we could but invoke it,

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.580 align:middle line:84%
if we could find the means
to communicate to the deeper

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.850 align:middle line:84%
parts of ourselves
and to each other

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
to bring that kind of
perfected future into being.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
It's fallen out of
fashion recently

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of existential
whining and carping.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is
only a fad of the times.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
The future is endlessly
bright and full

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:84%
of transcendental promise for
those who are not afraid of it.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The future that you
described was a fourfold future.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:84%
In effect, feminism,
space flight, cybernetics,

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:84%
and hallucinogens, it
reminds me of Jung's image

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
of the mandala, the fourfold
mandala that we move into.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, well, these things
could be imagined as the four

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:27.230 align:middle line:10%
quarters of a mandala that taken
together create the totality

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:33.590 align:middle line:10%
of a free and caring world,
well-fed, well-governed,

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:10%
well intentioned, and pointed
toward the exploration

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:10%
of the mystery of being,
which is, I think,

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.670 align:middle line:10%
really the higher
calling of human beings.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We are naturally
called to the mystery.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.300 align:middle line:90%
We are naturally its acolytes.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And in all other roles, we
perform rather badly, I think.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:01.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a sense in which,
if we look at the future,

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.580 align:middle line:84%
we might ask ourselves,
why have a future at all?

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the meaning?

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.450 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
of being here?

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And you seem to be saying
to study, to appreciate

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:90%
the mystery of it all.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that history
is a kind of message from

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:90%
the ineffable.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
That in the rise of
dynastic families,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and the fall of empires, and
the migrations of peoples,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
there is a vast tale being told
that we are caged within art

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:42.530 align:middle line:84%
and that the great satisfaction
of contemplating this spectacle

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is to know where in
the tale you are.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Terrence McKenna, thank you
very much for being with me.

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's been such a pleasure.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's always a pleasure
to talk with you.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you very
much for being with us.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
