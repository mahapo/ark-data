00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:16.273 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:17.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jeffrey
Mishlove, and this is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:84%
part two of our two-part program
on imagery and the alphabet.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.610 align:middle line:84%
With me is Dr.
Leonard Shlain, who

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.300 align:middle line:84%
is the head of laparoscopic
surgery at the California

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Pacific Medical Center
in San Francisco.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.920 align:middle line:84%
He is also an
associate professor

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.650 align:middle line:84%
of surgery at the University
of California Medical

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Center in San Francisco.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
But most interestingly,
Dr. Shlain

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:90%
is the author of two books--

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:84%
"Art and Physics" and "The
Alphabet Versus the Goddess."

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, again, Leonard.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be back.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure
to be with you.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:84%
In part one of our
two-part program,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the two
hemispheres of the human brain,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:90%
and how they're lateralized.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And in most people
who are right-handed,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
the left hemisphere is dominant.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the hemisphere
associated with linear thought,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:84%
with language, as opposed
to the spatial appreciation

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.710 align:middle line:90%
of the right hemisphere.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And you also developed the
point that in ancient cultures,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
almost universally
throughout Europe and Asia,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
goddess worship was the
norm, as well as a kind

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of egalitarianism
between men and women.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:10%
And that roughly, when we
think of recorded history,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:10%
it's a time when the
alphabet developed,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:10%
the focus on the left
hemisphere developed.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:10%
And at the same time, the
goddesses fell into, I suppose,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:10%
a dormant state--

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:10%
historically speaking.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The goddess was
replaced by the god.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.382 align:middle line:90%
Correct.

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:56.680 align:middle line:10%
I made the point in
the book that it's

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:10%
a Marshall McLuhan-type
of argument

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:10%
that the medium is the message.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:10%
That the means by which
you perceive information,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.150 align:middle line:10%
the process by which you
perceive information affects

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:10%
the way your brain works.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:10%
And I think that if you
introduce into culture

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:10%
a form of communication as
radical and revolutionary

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:10%
is an alphabet-- and the
reason that alphabets

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.730 align:middle line:10%
are so revolutionary
compared to,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:10%
say, cuneiform or
hieroglyphics, is

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.470 align:middle line:10%
that they're so simple to use
and to learn that children can

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:10%
learn them at a very early age.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And people who have below
average intelligence

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:90%
can learn how to read and write.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
So you suddenly have this
culture-changing medium

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that reinforces the left
hemisphere of both men

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
and women.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And the result of that is
to masculine the culture.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the left hemisphere
is the hemisphere

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.020 align:middle line:84%
of the brain predominantly
involved in the strategy

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.210 align:middle line:90%
of hunting and killing.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
All hunters, if they don't kill
their prey, they go hungry.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, humans belong to
a category of species

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:90%
called social predators.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:90%
We hunt in packs.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
We're like lions and orca
whales and wild dogs and hyenas.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And we are the only
species where the females

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:90%
don't hunt with the males.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is a profound fact
that affects gender relations.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It has to do, I suppose,
with the long length of time it

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.620 align:middle line:90%
takes for an infant to develop.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't take a
crying baby on a hunt.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And because of the prolonged
period of child-raising,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.690 align:middle line:84%
then you had a divergence
in the male and female

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.420 align:middle line:84%
of the human species,
which then got

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.080 align:middle line:84%
reflected in the manner
with which their brains are

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.130 align:middle line:90%
organized.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.798 align:middle line:84%
So that women have a
different way of knowing,

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:12.840 align:middle line:84%
a different way of
communicating, a different way

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:90%
of relating than men do.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And we know, for instance,
that women have 10% to 33%

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.600 align:middle line:84%
more neurons in the anterior
part of the commissure, which

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.940 align:middle line:84%
is the corpus callosum,
which connects the right

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%
and left hemispheres.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, if somebody has
more neurons connecting

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
the right and the
left, then you would

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.630 align:middle line:84%
infer from that, that the
left hemisphere, which

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.150 align:middle line:84%
is your language
lobe, is more in touch

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
with the right hemisphere,
which has many emotions in it.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think that
there's very many men that

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.500 align:middle line:84%
would argue with the fact
that women are probably

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.640 align:middle line:84%
better than men at
expressing their emotions.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might think
that that would

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:90%
put the men at a disadvantage.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
But when a man is engaged in the
most dangerous activity called

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
the hunt, to not have
emotions spilling over

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
from the other side, to be cool
and dispassionate about hunting

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
allows him to carry
out his task and kill

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
what it is that he was hunting.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So you have these two
strategies to survive--

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.185 align:middle line:84%
gathering and nurturing,
and hunting and killing.

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Now the good news
is is that they're

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:90%
combined in every human being.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Every man has a
gathering/nurturing side,

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
every woman has a
hunting/killing side.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And in the main,
hunter and killers

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.300 align:middle line:84%
can be found more often
among men, and in the main,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:84%
gatherers and nurturers can
be found best among women.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And in tribal societies, I
gather these two functions were

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.485 align:middle line:90%
quite well together.

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way we
lived for 2,990,000 years.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:84%
That was the design of all
hunter/gatherer communities.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And then about 10,000
years ago, somewhere,

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
some place, some
time somebody noticed

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.673 align:middle line:84%
that seeds dropped
in the kitchen midden

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.090 align:middle line:84%
were growing grain when they
came back the following year.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And they said if we plant
these intentionally and take

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
care of this, then we'll have
a guaranteed food supply.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And about the same time,
the men said, why are we

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:84%
risking our lives trying
to hunt these wild boars

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and getting gored?

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we build a
corral and domesticate them

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and raise pigs?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we won't
be at any risk.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So husbandry and agriculture
changed the human equation.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Because suddenly, instead
of hunting and killing,

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:84%
all of the feminine aspects
of gathering and nurturing

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.885 align:middle line:90%
came to the fore.

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So there really
isn't a whole lot

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.098 align:middle line:84%
of difference between
raising a young child,

00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:84%
and looking out for them, and
making sure that they're clean,

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and that they've got
fresh water to drink,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
out of harm's way,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and protecting stocks of
grain that are growing.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Or feeding your
flocks and making sure

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.060 align:middle line:90%
that they're healthy.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
between 10,000 years ago

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and 5,000 years ago is that
all the spirits winnowed

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
to become one person, one
spirit-- one dominant spirit

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.670 align:middle line:90%
called an Earth goddess.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And both men and
women prayed to her.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.290 align:middle line:90%
Because you better.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Because if there was drought
or pestilence or blight,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
you're all going to starve.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.780 align:middle line:10%
So we find evidence in every
pre-literate agricultural

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:10%
society that's
ever been studied,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:10%
with very few exceptions,
people worshipped the goddess.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.890 align:middle line:10%
And then, beginning
5,000 years ago,

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:10%
she starts losing power to
this sun-lover husband who

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:10%
was usually weaker, smaller.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:84%
He usually died every
year in an accident.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
She brought him
back in the spring.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.630 align:middle line:10%
And then he starts
getting all pumped up,

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:10%
and he becomes much
stronger than she is.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:10%
And then she begins to lose her
power, and then she disappears.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And my question
is, what happened?

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:10%
What event in culture could
have been so immense and so

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:10%
pervasive as to change
the sex of the god?

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:10%
And I maintain that
it was an inside job.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:10%
It was their change
in mental programming

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:10%
as a result of learning a new
means of communication that

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:10%
was linear and sequential
and reductionist.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greece, there
were two societies.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
There were Athens and Sparta.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Now the Athenians
and the Spartans

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.712 align:middle line:90%
lived very close to each other.

00:08:48.712 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
They spoke the same language.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.150 align:middle line:90%
They wrote the same language.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:90%
They worshiped the same gods.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:90%
They were both bellicose.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the Athenians
were the home

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
of the first extended
experience in democracy.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
The Athenians sat
around and discussed

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.940 align:middle line:90%
the aesthetics of art.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
They were the first culture to--

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.410 align:middle line:84%
playwrights and
historians and the most

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.530 align:middle line:84%
magnificent contributions
to Western civilization

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:90%
come from Athens.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Sparta was a militaristic,
fascist society

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
that did not leave
for posterity,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:84%
a single historical,
literary, or

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:90%
philosophical accomplishment.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you would say, well, let's
see how these two cultures

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:90%
treated women.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So you would assume that
the women would fare better

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:90%
in Athens.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not the case.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Athenian
women were banned

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.335 align:middle line:84%
from owning property, which,
of course, is the key to power.

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
They were subservient
to the men.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.400 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't participate
in public life.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:90%
They weren't educated.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And Spartan women actually
were educated fairly similar

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:90%
to boys--

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:90%
the girls were.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.940 align:middle line:84%
A Spartan woman could have a
child by more than one man.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:90%
She ruled in his absence.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And by the fourth
century, Spartan women

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.845 align:middle line:84%
own 2/5 of all the
property in Sparta.

00:10:09.845 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:84%
What was the difference
between these two cultures?

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.038 align:middle line:84%
One was-- the most
glaring was their attitude

00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:16.080 align:middle line:90%
towards the written word.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:84%
One despised it and the
other one glorified it.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:10%
And I maintain that
if you follow history

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:10%
and you go through and you
see how in the Dark Ages,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:10%
the people of Europe began to--

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:39.060 align:middle line:10%
this phenomenon occurred
of the most sacred object

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:10%
in the church
being a black Mary.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:49.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's a strange development
when you go across--

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:84%
it extended from
Russia to Spain, Italy,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.340 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Mediterranean.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.475 align:middle line:10%
Today you can go to Europe
and you'll find these statutes

00:11:01.475 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:10%
>> The Black Madonna.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:90%
>> The Black Madonna.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And why would a Caucasian,
largely blue-eyed,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
blond-haired peoples make their
sacred object a Black Madonna?

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:15.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, why?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would think that
the Earth Goddess was black.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.640 align:middle line:90%
Isis--

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Was kind of a
rebirth of the Earth.

00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:90%
But why at that time?

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because people had lost
the ability to read and write.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Throughout secular
Europe-- who was it?

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.317 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm blanking his name now.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
But the estimates were that
no king or nobleman could read

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:90%
or write for hundreds of years.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> During the Dark Ages.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:10%
>> And it wasn't
until Charlemagne,

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:10%
that he started to institute
reforms that brought back

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:10%
literacy.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, in part one of our
two-part program we did cover

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:10%
this issue in Western
culture, the Mesopotamians,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptians, the Middle Ages.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Many people, I think, would
come back at you, Leonard,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:90%
and say, well, how about Asia?

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:10%
Here they had a picture
language-- ideographs--

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:10%
and yet, they also
developed a harsh treatment

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.810 align:middle line:10%
of their females.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I maintain that on the
spectrum of communication,

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.460 align:middle line:10%
from oral speech on one side
to written communication,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.515 align:middle line:10%
the alphabet on the other
side, that any form of written

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:24.890 align:middle line:10%
communication-- whether it's
hieroglyphics or ideographic

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:10%
writing--

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.170 align:middle line:10%
is much closer to alphabets
than it is to oral speech.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.550 align:middle line:10%
But the Chinese culture
developed a unique form

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:10%
of writing called ideographs
about the same time

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:10%
that the West
developed the alphabet.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
shaped Chinese culture.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Now interestingly
enough, in ancient China,

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.880 align:middle line:84%
there were two
philosophical systems that

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.230 align:middle line:90%
emerged almost simultaneously.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.040 align:middle line:90%
One was Lao-Tzu's Taoism.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
was Confucianism,

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.140 align:middle line:90%
based on Confucius.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Now Taoism was a very feminine
belief system, which said,

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.565 align:middle line:84%
you know, wise man doesn't
try to control anything.

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:07.365 align:middle line:90%
Make no dams.

00:13:07.365 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Passivity is the most
important principle.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Confucianism, on the
other hand, believed

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
that a man needed to
control his emotions first,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.410 align:middle line:84%
his wife second, and
his children third.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.045 align:middle line:84%
And this hierarchy was the
unit basis for all of society,

00:13:28.045 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
that if that didn't hold, that
all of society would crumble.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.940 align:middle line:10%
So Taoism and Confucianism
were like two interweaving sine

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.180 align:middle line:10%
waves throughout
Chinese history.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Taoists, as I recall,
were really against literacy.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the most
remarkable event occurred.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:10%
And that was in
1923, the Chinese

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.140 align:middle line:10%
invented the printing press.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
their printing press

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
never became like the west's
because a printing press

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:84%
that depends on
ideographic characters

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.560 align:middle line:84%
meant that the printer had
to have huge inventory.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Thousands of block letters.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Thousands of blocks,
as opposed to Gutenberg,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.720 align:middle line:90%
who only needed 26 bins.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, literacy
rates soared in China.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:10%
And the Sung Dynasty began,
which, of course, gave us

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:10%
these wonderful porcelains
and art and philosophers.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.550 align:middle line:10%
And if I were to ask you what
is the most misogynist thing

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:10%
that the Chinese men
did to their women,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:10%
you would, say,
well, foot binding.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.570 align:middle line:90%
Foot binding, sure.

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So when would you
think the first episode,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:10%
the first recorded case of foot
binding occurred in this 5,000

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:10%
year period of Chinese history?

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a few decades.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.060 align:middle line:90%
970 was the first recorded case.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:10%
And if you think
about it, foot binding

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:10%
was a very strange fetish
because the men suddenly

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:10%
decided that a hobbled woman
was a sexy woman, that bending

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.380 align:middle line:10%
a young, growing girl's
foot back and making

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.140 align:middle line:10%
her walk on the tops of her toes
so that she could barely walk

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:10%
was something desirable.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Now if you think about it,
the printing press presses.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And what was done
to women's feet

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:90%
were that they were pressed.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And the strips of linen
that were used to make paper

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:84%
were the strips of linen that
were used to bind the feet.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So somehow or
other, the metaphors

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of this new communication
technology somehow or other

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:84%
leaked over into culture and
became this bizarre fetish.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me ask
you another question.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.840 align:middle line:84%
We had a chance to
discuss this earlier,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and I don't think
it's in your book,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.930 align:middle line:84%
but it seems
relevant to me, which

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.470 align:middle line:84%
is I've had a chance to visit
Papua, New Guinea, where we

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
have people who lived under
what we think of as Stone Age

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:90%
conditions until the 1930s.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And when these tribes
were first discovered,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
they seemed to be very
misogynist, very strong male

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:90%
ethic in that culture.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet they were
completely pre-literate.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
I think that you have to be
very cautious when you look for

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:90%
and find extremes.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the fact that they were
Stone Age in the 20th century

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:90%
says something.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Most people were not Stone
Age in the 20th century.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
Why were they Stone
Age that long?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, you have to be very
careful that western culture

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:84%
anthropologists and influences
have leaked into that culture

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and corrupted it.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:10%
So we're not exactly
sure that studying

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:10%
these people and their
habits is a fair reflection

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:10%
of the way they used to be.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
All it takes is one literate
person in a community

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:90%
to change that community.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a saying that
in the valley of the blind,

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
the one-eyed man is king.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
And I'm aware, and I
want to make it clear,

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.790 align:middle line:84%
that I don't believe that we've
ever discovered that there's

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:84%
a matriarchal
society, that there's

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
a society where women had more
or even equal power to men.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:84%
But there certainly have
been enough studies by now

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that there are a
lot of pre-literate agricultural

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:84%
societies in which women's
status is a lot higher than it

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:84%
had been in the literate
societies of Western Europe.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>> You use the American
Indians as an example of that.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
There were Plains Indians
that had a tradition

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
that only the wise women of the
tribe could elect the chief.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine if we structured
our society today on a policy

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
that only women of a
certain age could vote.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
What kind of society
would we have?

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:56.150 align:middle line:84%
What kind of priorities
would we have?

00:17:56.150 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:10%
So the Iroquois Nation was
so advanced and peaceful

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:10%
in its conflict resolution that
Benjamin Franklin recommended

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:18.170 align:middle line:10%
incorporating many of the
Iroquois Nation's institutions

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.090 align:middle line:10%
into our United
States Constitution.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're always kind of
claiming we got it from Europe

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:90%
and refined it.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But in point of fact, that's not
exactly true, or not completely

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the points that
you're making is not only do we

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:84%
have this precedent, but
in the last 100 years,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:84%
especially here in
a western society,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
we are returning
more to the image.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, people talk

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.870 align:middle line:90%
about the rise of the goddess.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.855 align:middle line:84%
Just look at this
phenomenon of Diana.

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:10%
Diana was created
by photographers,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:10%
and she was maybe even
killed by photographers.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.750 align:middle line:10%
But it was her image
that absolutely

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:10%
captivated the world.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:10%
And at her death,
people talked about her

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:04.430 align:middle line:10%
in mythological terms.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:10%
They said, it's a Greek tragedy.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.920 align:middle line:10%
It's a fairy tale.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And the qualities that
touched so many people

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.390 align:middle line:84%
were her vulnerability, her
compassion, her openness,

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
things that are associated
with the feminine.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So the worldwide outpouring
for the death of this princess,

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:34.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, would have been
possible in any other time

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:84%
other than a time where we
are so saturated with images,

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:84%
that we have image
information that--

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:90%
we're bombarded with it.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I was in New York recently,
and I was walking down

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Fifth Avenue, and there was
a five-foot story billboard

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of some ad for some
clothing manufacturer,

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and this image of this
woman on the street.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think to
myself, this is not

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.950 align:middle line:84%
the way most people
hardly ever saw

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.000 align:middle line:84%
images, other than the images
that they would see regularly.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:84%
That was not the way
they communicated.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And there's definitely now
a tendency for women to have

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.032 align:middle line:84%
greater and greater equality
social relationships.

00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as I mentioned
on the last show,

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.073 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's a coincidence
that the first feminist

00:20:21.073 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:84%
movement in 5,000 years just
happened to be in the first

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:90%
television generation.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that the boys
of that generation, many

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
of the men were supportive
of the women's aspirations,

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
this speaks to the fact
that something changed.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I remember in 1958, when I
was graduating from University

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of Michigan, at the time
the president of Harvard

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:84%
gave a speech that
was later in "Time"

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
magazine about how this
was the silent generation.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
felt that television

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:84%
had made us so passive that
the status of the democracy

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:90%
was under siege.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, he said, if you think
that this group is passive,

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.148 align:middle line:84%
just wait a few years until the
real generation that was raised

00:21:11.148 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:90%
and television reaches college.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, the
counterculture of the '60s just

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.100 align:middle line:84%
blew everything apart, and it
ran absolutely the opposite

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:90%
of what everybody predicted.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And these rug rats
turned couch potatoes

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.380 align:middle line:84%
and who watched "The Howdy
Doody Show" actually became

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.572 align:middle line:84%
social activists and
initiated great social change.

00:21:31.572 --> 00:21:32.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And the anti-war movement.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, you could say
demographics and the pill

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of other things
were certainly influential.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:44.630 align:middle line:84%
But it was a phenomenon
that was like a Renaissance.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.700 align:middle line:10%
And now we're sort of going
through a mini-Reformation

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:57.350 align:middle line:10%
in that we're swinging back to a
much more left hemispheric mode

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:05.810 align:middle line:10%
of literalism, fundamentalism,
and a reading of society that's

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:10%
based on the literal
interpretation of scripture.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of as a reaction
against the rise of the image.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.280 align:middle line:90%
But it will swing again.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.080 align:middle line:90%
It'll swing again.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's as if
from your perspective,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
if I look at human society,
we've been in a 5,000-year

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:30.020 align:middle line:84%
cycle in which the
god has dominated,

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:84%
just as the left
hemisphere has dominated.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And right now may be the time
when the pendulum is starting

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.020 align:middle line:90%
to swing the other way.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
Nietzsche said in 1888,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:90%
he said God is dead.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:10%
And the god he was talking
about was that old patriarch

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.750 align:middle line:10%
with the long white
beard up on the cloud.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.790 align:middle line:10%
But a few years earlier
the Catholic church

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:10%
declared that Mary had been born
by immaculate conception, which

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:55.550 align:middle line:10%
elevated her from the
mortal to above the moral

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:10%
to almost divine.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.780 align:middle line:10%
So the question comes
is, why is this happening

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:10%
at this particular time?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, photography
and electromagnetism

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:84%
were discovered
earlier in the century.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I maintain in my book
that the combinations

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:84%
of photography and
electromagnetism,

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.800 align:middle line:84%
first photography, then
film, then television, then

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.340 align:middle line:84%
computer graphics, the internet
have been just transforming

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.210 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It reminds me of a bumper
sticker I see from time to time

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:90%
that says "The Goddess is alive.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Magic is afoot."

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's interesting
that in film, we

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.710 align:middle line:84%
started referring
to the women who

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:90%
were actresses as goddesses.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We started calling them
sirens or sorceresses

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:90%
or enchantresses.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:84%
We began using all the
mythological terminology that

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.330 align:middle line:84%
had been used 5,000
years ago and hadn't been

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:90%
heard in the last 5,000 years.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want to remind you that
the worst period for women

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
in the entire history
of recorded civilization

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.790 align:middle line:84%
was during the period of
steeply rising alphabet literacy

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:02.180 align:middle line:84%
rates in Europe following
Gutenberg's printing press.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
The witch hunts never
occurred anywhere outside

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:90%
of civilized Europe.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Russia, which remained
largely illiterate,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.370 align:middle line:90%
did not have witch hunts.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:13.250 align:middle line:84%
The Muslim countries that
bordered Europe, and Bosnia,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:16.825 align:middle line:84%
and all along that whole
border, they didn't have witch

00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:84%
hunts because they weren't
impacted by the printing press.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.380 align:middle line:84%
The witch hunts
were the most severe

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.338 align:middle line:84%
in Germany and Switzerland,
France and England,

00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and the countries
that were giving us

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare and Galileo
and Newton and Bach.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What an incredible discovery
you've made, Leonard Shlain.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
This is provocative, and
it hits us sort of right

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.880 align:middle line:90%
between the eyes, in a sense.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.650 align:middle line:10%
We're surrounded
by the alphabet,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:10%
but we rarely stop to think of
the impact that it's had on us.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.700 align:middle line:90%
It's hard when you're--

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:84%
like you said earlier, it's
not fish who discover water.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We're entangled in this
skein of written words.
