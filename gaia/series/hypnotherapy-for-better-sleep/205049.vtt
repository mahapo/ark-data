[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> You're listening to
the "Falling Asleep"

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:90%
hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.260 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.620 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions,
aiming to help you reach

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:90%
a deep state of relaxation.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.010 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.215 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you will
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.450 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.110 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.040 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now, to
imagine that you're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.010 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.125 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.170 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you, now,
to take in a deep breath.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.030 align:middle line:90%
And you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush,
green grass underfoot.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And as you get
nearer, you can smell

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.855 align:middle line:90%
their beautiful, fragrant scent.

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And now, take in another
long, deep breath.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale the
rich, fragrant scent,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.285 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:43.285 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.350 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path,
stepping down easily

00:03:50.350 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
onto the wide steps beneath you
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
You relax more and more
with every step you take.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.440 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And it has golden sand, like
a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.120 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.000 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:50.590 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one after
the other, gentle, rhythmic

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.340 align:middle line:84%
the sound of the waves
peaceful and reassuring.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.490 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.420 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with the warm sea air

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.380 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:38.230 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:49.280 align:middle line:84%
behind you as you walk onwards,
relaxing deeper and deeper

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.125 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the sea's
edge, the waves gently rolling

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
in and out, you notice how
your feet sink down deeper

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.228 align:middle line:90%
than before into the wet sand.

00:06:13.228 --> 00:06:17.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's warm and
inviting as you

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:36.290 align:middle line:84%
let your toes test the water
with every wave that rolls in

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:90%
and back out again.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you're ready,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:90%
you walk back up the beach.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lovely deck
chair waiting just for you

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.000 align:middle line:84%
on the sand under an
umbrella, offering

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.815 align:middle line:90%
just the right amount of shade.

00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat and
you relax deeply now.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:84%
You take in a deep
breath and take

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.115 align:middle line:84%
in your beautiful surroundings
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:19.115 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And you notice the sky, a clear,
blue sky without a cloud in it.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.220 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.210 align:middle line:84%
with polished, ornate
banister running down

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep,
rich carpet that

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.050 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.220 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.525 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:48.525 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.049 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to 1.

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:37.721 align:middle line:90%


00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:90%
10.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:47.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.220 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.420 align:middle line:90%
8.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:02.250 align:middle line:84%
More and more relaxed
now, sinking even further

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:90%
7.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Deeply comfortable, feeling
every muscle release

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.685 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
6, 5.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Even further into your deep
state of relaxation now.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.390 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.190 align:middle line:90%
4.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your mind and body to
fully relax as you sink further

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:90%
into deep relaxation.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
3.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Comfortable, heavy, any
tension completely gone now.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Almost at the bottom now,
just one more step to go.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.240 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Going deeper and
deeper down, now,

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
to hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.660 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.536 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:27.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at
the bottom of those steps,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:84%
feeling so very comfortable,
very relaxed and at peace.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.640 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs and
the ordinary, everyday world

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
as you sit deeply into the
comfortable, relaxing state

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:84%
deeply inside of you,
your subconscious mind

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.260 align:middle line:90%
still fully alert and aware.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:84%
But you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Every night, when most
of us go to sleep,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:42.170 align:middle line:84%
we don't know exactly how or
when we'll drift off to sleep.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.855 align:middle line:84%
We just know that it usually
happens all by itself.

00:12:45.855 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
For many of us, sleep comes
easily and effortlessly.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And after a good night's
sleep, we can awaken,

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:08.159 align:middle line:84%
refreshed and alert and ready
to embrace each new day .

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:12.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're not finding
sleep quite so easily

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:90%
as you once did.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:84%
It may be that your
natural pattern of sleep

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:31.020 align:middle line:84%
has been interrupted and you
have found yourself waking up

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
in the early hours
of the morning

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're unable to
get back to sleep.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you feel the panic
rising as you simply

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:90%
can't drift off back to sleep.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But all of this is
going to change now.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
You're making steps
to change this

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and listening to
this MindTALK is

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
a huge step towards
changing those thinking

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.285 align:middle line:90%
and behavioral patterns.

00:14:06.285 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're waking
in the early hours

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and you have some
intrusive thoughts

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:90%
going around your head.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.860 align:middle line:84%
It may seem like the more you
try to put those thoughts out

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:31.815 align:middle line:84%
of your mind, the more those
thoughts seem to persist.

00:14:31.815 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:84%
They may even grow and magnify
until you're no longer drowsy.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You're fully awake
and absolutely

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.440 align:middle line:90%
unable to get back to sleep.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Our minds are incredible.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And your imagination
at this hour

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.555 align:middle line:90%
will be working at full speed.

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:84%
When this happens,
the more you try

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to push your thoughts away
and get back to sleep,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
the less likely this is to
happen, the more difficult

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.910 align:middle line:90%
it will become.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you're trying to
remember the name of something

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.870 align:middle line:84%
and you think as hard as you can
but you just can't remember it,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:84%
it's only when you stop
trying that it comes to you.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.660 align:middle line:90%


00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.990 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer going to
try and go back to sleep.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
This is wasted energy, and
it will work against you.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.230 align:middle line:84%
That old problem of waking
up in the early hours

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and trying so hard
to get back to sleep

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.520 align:middle line:90%
is now going to change.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
There is no conscious
trying involved now.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:90%
You simply do it.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
It will come to you
just like that forgotten

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.255 align:middle line:90%
name you try to recall.

00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:15.770 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So from now on, if you do
wake in the early hours,

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.945 align:middle line:84%
the first thing you do is
put sleep completely out

00:16:24.945 --> 00:16:25.745 align:middle line:90%
of your mind.

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I would like you to
get into a comfortable position

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate
on your breathing.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.470 align:middle line:84%
You place the tip of your
tongue on your upper front teeth

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and keep it there
for the entire time

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:84%
you're doing the
breathing exercise.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.182 align:middle line:84%
You remember that everyone has
a different rate of breath,

00:17:00.182 --> 00:17:03.410 align:middle line:90%
a different lung capacity.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And you must find a place
that's right for you.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you, now,
to close your mouth

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and inhale very quietly
through your nose

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to a mental count of
four and hold your breath

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.315 align:middle line:90%
for a count of seven.

00:17:22.315 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So a count in for four and
hold your breath for seven.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Once you've done
that, you can then

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
exhale through your mouth
to a count of eight,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.015 align:middle line:84%
a long, slow, gentle,
powerful breath out.

00:17:42.015 --> 00:17:47.930 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And it may take you a few
goes to find your place,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.440 align:middle line:84%
to find a rhythm that's
comfortable for you.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.380 align:middle line:84%
But once you've
found it, you become

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
comfortable with your inhalation
for four, holding for seven,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:90%
exhaling for eight--

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
in for four, hold for
seven, out for eight.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And once you've found your
rhythm, you've found your pace,

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and this breathing technique
comes easily to you,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.930 align:middle line:90%
you do this over and over.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:90%
You close your mouth.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:47.110 align:middle line:84%
You inhale quietly through
your nose to a count to four,

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.070 align:middle line:84%
holding your breath
for a count of seven,

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:84%
and exhaling to a
count of eight--

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:84%
long, slow, gentle,
powerful breaths out.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.425 align:middle line:84%
It may take some practice,
and that's totally normal.

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:20.200 align:middle line:84%
By breathing in this way,
you're quieting the mind,

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.230 align:middle line:84%
letting go of worries,
and flooding your body

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:28.510 align:middle line:84%
with oxygen, which has such a
relaxing effect on your body.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
If your mind is still
working overtime

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
and those internal
thoughts are overpowering,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.585 align:middle line:84%
then I'd like you to
imagine a small, metal box.

00:19:45.585 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
You place those
thoughts inside the box

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and close the lid firmly,
locking it securely.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.650 align:middle line:84%
You place the box on the side
of your bed on the floor.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And if a new thought
pops up, then you simply

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.730 align:middle line:84%
put it inside the box and
remove it from your mind.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:90%


00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you're doing
this, you feel the relief

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:84%
of tension flowing
out of you as you

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.840 align:middle line:84%
know you can deal with
any worries the next day.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:29.985 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
anything else can wait.

00:20:29.985 --> 00:20:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Right now, your body is
heavy and comfortable, heavy

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.115 align:middle line:84%
And your mind is only focused
on your breathing and nothing

00:20:45.115 --> 00:20:45.915 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:20:45.915 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And while still lying
comfortably and calmly,

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.580 align:middle line:84%
you can allow your
mind to drift off

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.905 align:middle line:84%
to anything that makes you
feel happy and at peace.

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:84%
This may be a holiday coming up
or a beautiful memory, friends

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.570 align:middle line:84%
you are about to
see, or maybe you

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:17.120 align:middle line:84%
prefer to imagine yourself
relaxing in a hammock

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.170 align:middle line:84%
on a beautiful beach with
a warm, gentle breeze

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:90%
blowing over you.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
possibilities, and only you

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.840 align:middle line:90%
know what's appropriate for you.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
You may even imagine
yourself curled up in bed,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:84%
breathing heavily as you
are, under the covers

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.485 align:middle line:90%
in your lovely cozy bed.

00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps you imagine that
it's a cold, icy night outside

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
and snow has been falling
for most of the day,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
but you're toasty and
warm, snuggled up, heavy,

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.550 align:middle line:90%
comfortable, and sleepy.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:90%


00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness begins to fade
as images float in and out

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:90%
of your subconscious mind.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And you're surprised to
realize, when morning eventually

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:84%
arrives and you
open your eyes, how

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:29.240 align:middle line:90%
sleep came so naturally to you.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So, from now on,
you find you forget

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%
about trying to go back to
sleep in those early hours.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And by listening
to this MindTALK,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:50.230 align:middle line:84%
maybe once, maybe a few
times, your mind and body

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:90%
will start to make some changes.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be amazed
at how incredible you

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:03.690 align:middle line:84%
feel after a long night's sleep,
waking refreshed and energized.

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious
mind will be taking

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:90%
in all of these messages.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, when
the pattern is broken,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
your mind will forget to
even think about sleep.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can forget to
wake up in the early hours

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.965 align:middle line:84%
unless it's really
necessary that you remember.

00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And should intrusive
thoughts try

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
to enter your mind while
you're waiting for sleep,

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you can always remember
to place them there

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:48.320 align:middle line:84%
in the box next to
your bed and instantly

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
forget about them until
you're ready to deal

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.120 align:middle line:90%
with the box's contents.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
You remember your
breathing of in for four,

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
holding the breath for seven,
and exhaling for eight.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
You no longer try
to go back to sleep.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:90%
You simply do.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:23.090 align:middle line:84%
Your mind allows you to create a
new sleeping pattern to emerge,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and you trust in
your mind to do this.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself drifting
easily and effortlessly

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
into sleep once those
thoughts are safely

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.395 align:middle line:90%
enclosed in that box.

00:24:37.395 --> 00:24:41.540 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.500 align:middle line:84%
You remember to wake up at
your desired waking up time,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
feeling refreshed and alert
after a good night's sleep.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if there
is the occasional time

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:84%
when you awaken during the
night, there's no panic.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.450 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely normal.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:10.600 align:middle line:84%
But it happens less and
less as your new sleep

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:90%
pattern re-establishes itself.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.390 align:middle line:90%


00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind may
need a little practice at first

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to get out of the habit.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.320 align:middle line:84%
But you're teaching your
mind new patterns now,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.190 align:middle line:84%
new behaviors, and
you trust in this.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:37.290 align:middle line:84%
It may be soon, maybe tonight,
or maybe in a few days' time,

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
but your subconscious
mind will surprise you

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
with a heavenly full night's
sleep with no interruptions

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.800 align:middle line:84%
at all, no waking
up, no spending what

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.830 align:middle line:84%
seems like an eternity
trying to recapture

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.015 align:middle line:84%
the peaceful, sleepy state
you were previously enjoying.

00:25:57.015 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Just one long, peaceful sleep
from evening to morning.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, your
subconscious mind

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:84%
always remembers when it's
your desired time to wake up.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can do so
easily and effortlessly,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.920 align:middle line:84%
feeling refreshed and alert
after a good night's sleep.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:32.278 align:middle line:90%
