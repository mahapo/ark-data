your subconscious mind

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%

But right now there's
nothing at all

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.260 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart from close
your eyes, relax and let go,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and really enjoy the peaceful
feelings and benefits that

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:90%
come with it.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
imagine that you're

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.540 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful garden
with colorful flowers

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.620 align:middle line:90%
and immaculate manicured lawns.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.715 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and
the sky is a clear blue.

00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:84%
The temperature is
just how you like it,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:90%
and there's a cool breeze.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
There's no pollen
in the air at all,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.920 align:middle line:84%
and you feel happy
and comfortable

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.020 align:middle line:90%
in the clean, fresh, pure air.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You take a look around you
at all the beautiful colors,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and you hear the sounds of
the birds singing overhead.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.019 align:middle line:84%
You're calm and relaxed here,
and you feel safe and secure.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to take a deep breath.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe out, you can
relax deeper and deeper now.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
You take a gentle walk
around the garden,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:90%
and you're barefoot as you walk.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the lush
green grass underfoot,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and you walk towards
some beautiful flowers.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And as you get
nearer, you can smell

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.465 align:middle line:90%
their beautiful, fragrant scent.

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:54.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
The colors are magnificent,
and they grow brighter

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
as you approach them.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And now take in another
long deep breath.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And as you Inhale the
rich, fragrant scent,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:84%
you relax even deeper as
you exhale gently now.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
You take another stroll
around the garden,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
and you find a pathway
leading down to a beach.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
You follow the path, stepping
down easily onto the wide steps

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:90%
beneath you.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:52.050 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper and deeper,
you relax more and more

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.580 align:middle line:90%
with every step you take.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And you soon reach the
beautiful beach, which is empty.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And it has a golden sound,
like a fine powder underfoot.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
You enjoy the feeling of soft,
powdery sand beneath your feet.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.315 align:middle line:84%
And you take a look
out at the horizon.

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
You take in the
vastness of the sea,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
and you watch as the
waves rhythmically

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:84%
roll in and out again, one
after the other, gentle rhythmic

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
waves rolling towards the
beach and back out again.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
The sound of the waves,
peaceful and reassuring.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
You feel a sense
of calm and peace

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
as the sun gently shines down
on you with the warm sea air

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:90%
gently sweeping over you.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.770 align:middle line:84%
As you walk across the
beach, you feel your feet

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.860 align:middle line:84%
sinking further into the sand,
leaving a delicate footprint

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:90%
behind you as you walk onwards.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing deeper and deeper
with every step you take.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
sea's edge, the waves

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:90%
gently rolling in and out.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
You notice how your
feet sink deeper than

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.695 align:middle line:90%
before into the wet sand.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
You feel the water gently
lap at your ankles,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.050 align:middle line:90%
and it's warm and inviting.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you let your toes test
the water with every wave that

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:90%
rolls in and back out again.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:34.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.050 align:middle line:84%
And after a while,
when you are ready,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.080 align:middle line:90%
you walk back up the beach.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lovely deck
chair waiting just for you

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.600 align:middle line:84%
on the sand under
an umbrella offering

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%
just the right amount of shade.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
You take a seat, and
you relax deeply now.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.630 align:middle line:84%
You take a deep breath, and take
in your beautiful surroundings

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.715 align:middle line:90%
as you gently exhale now.

00:07:08.715 --> 00:07:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:84%
You look out at the
calming sea again.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And you notice the sky, a clear
blue sky, without a cloud in.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling so
relaxed now as you sit

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and relax comfortably and
deeply in your deck chair.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
As you rest in that chair,
you can allow your mind

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:84%
to imagine a staircase,
a beautiful staircase

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
with polished ornate
banister running down

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:84%
alongside a deep,
rich carpet that

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.535 align:middle line:84%
feels soft to the touch
underneath your bare feet.

00:08:02.535 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
As you look down the
stairs, you notice

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:18.760 align:middle line:84%
that there are 10 steps leading
gently down, 10 steps leading

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.685 align:middle line:90%
gently down and down.

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And these are the steps
that will lead you

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.840 align:middle line:84%
into deep relaxation,
giving you access

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.500 align:middle line:84%
to that powerful
subconscious, allowing

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
you to make those changes
that you want to make today.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:43.929 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, I'd like you to
walk down those steps with me

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.705 align:middle line:84%
and I'll count them off
for you one at a time.

00:08:51.705 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that
the deeper down you go,

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.205 align:middle line:84%
the more comfortable and the
more relaxed you'll become.

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you're ready to
walk down the stairs,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
I want you to gently place
your hand onto the banister

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and begin to slowly descend the
staircase as I count them off

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
from 10 to 1.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.850 align:middle line:84%
10, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.700 align:middle line:84%
9, deeply relaxed,
deeply comfortable.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
8, more and more relaxed
now, sinking even further

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.810 align:middle line:90%
into relaxation.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
7, deeply comfortable,
feeling every muscle release

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:90%
as you go deeper and deeper.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
6, 5, even further into your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:84%
4, allowing your mind and
body to fully relax as you

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.402 align:middle line:84%
sink further into
deep relaxation.

00:10:28.402 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:84%
3, comfortable, heavy
inattention completely gone

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:48.880 align:middle line:84%
now 2, almost at the bottom
now, just one more step to go.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And 1, going deeper
and deeper down now

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
into hypnosis, all the way down
to that deeper, healthier level

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
of mind, deeper than
you've ever been.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you reach the
bottom of the staircase,

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
letting go of the
banister, you let

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%
go of any worries or concerns.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and you let
nothing bother or concern you

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Nobody needs or wants
anything from you.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And you're now standing at the
bottom of those steps feeling

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.160 align:middle line:84%
so very comfortable, very
relaxed, and at peace.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
You can allow those stairs
and the ordinary everyday wall

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
to just fade away, further
and further away now

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
as you sit deeply into the
comfortable relaxing state

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:90%
deeply inside of you.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious mind
still fully alert and aware,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.670 align:middle line:84%
but you're ready for the
changes about to come.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in this
deeply relaxed state,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
we're going to think
about the stress

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.930 align:middle line:90%
that you've been experiencing.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And it may be that you've been
experiencing a whole range

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.665 align:middle line:90%
of conflicting emotions.

00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's imbalance
in your life,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:90%
has been difficult to cope with.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But you've now decided it's
time to deal with these emotions

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and to create emotional calmness
and perhaps find a better way

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.155 align:middle line:90%
to manage stress levels.

00:12:58.155 --> 00:13:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Having made that decision,
you're already well on your way

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
to achieving your
goal because you

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
know that there are much better
ways of experiencing life,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
ways that are far more
productive, far more

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:90%
beneficial to you.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.830 align:middle line:84%
You know that where
one person may

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
be able to handle a
situation perfectly well,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:36.160 align:middle line:84%
another person may encounter
that exact same situation

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and find it
incredibly stressful.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
As I'm sure you're
already aware,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:84%
it all depends on
you and the thoughts

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that you allow to dwell in
your mind and the meaning

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
you attribute to your
thoughts, your environment,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:90%
and your experiences.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts influence
the way that you feel,

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and the way that
you feel determines

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:90%
how you perceive your world.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
But you are not your
thoughts, and these are mainly

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
thinking patterns that
have been repeated

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
over and over in
your head in order

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.455 align:middle line:90%
to form a belief or habit.

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So you recognize that you can
now replace your thoughts,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and more importantly,
control them

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.430 align:middle line:84%
so you can cope with situations
in a much more stress-free way.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's because you really want
to enjoy your life to the full

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that you've decided now to only
entertain positive thoughts

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.750 align:middle line:84%
The negative ones
that have made you

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
feel angry, upset, or
sad, or anxious are just

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.970 align:middle line:90%
not important to you anymore.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And you've decided now is
the time to let them go.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
You no longer want them.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:90%
You no longer need them.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Your mind rejects any and all
unpleasant negative thoughts.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.480 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you're
going to reframe

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
the way you think about those
old stressful situations,

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find that you can
soon change the way you feel.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.540 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Just like all living entities,
we're creatures of habit.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And this can be good and
sometimes not so good

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
depending on the habit that's
been allowed to develop.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions went through
a similar habitual pattern.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.620 align:middle line:84%
At first, there was
the event, which

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:84%
created a stressful
thought in your mind.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And the thought, in turn,
created an emotion, which

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:90%
then resulted in a reaction.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've learned to repeat
that thinking pattern again

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
From now on, in any situation
that makes you feel stressed,

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.260 align:middle line:90%
you now replace that thought.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
You replace it with one
that fulfills your needs,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:36.160 align:middle line:84%
your desires, your wants, and
you work towards your goals.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You ensure you say something
positive to yourself

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
with energy and
meaning behind it,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:84%
breaking this negative
thinking patterns,

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
learning how to manage
the stress in life.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to have a
think about your main cause

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of stress, have a think
about what's causing you

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the most stress in
your daily life.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.819 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:11.810 align:middle line:84%
It may be your workload,
your financial situation,

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.680 align:middle line:84%
perhaps an argument with
a family member or friend,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.310 align:middle line:84%
or maybe an endless
list of things to do.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Remembering now that where
one person manages a situation

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.690 align:middle line:84%
perfectly well, another person
feels an overwhelming sense

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:90%
of stress.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The only difference being one
person allows it to affect them

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and the other ensures
stress bounces off them.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you ensure
that stress bounces off you.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:90%
And you can do this.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Your mind can do this.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:90%
It's simply practice.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.730 align:middle line:84%
Switching negative thinking to
positive over and over again

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.310 align:middle line:84%
will retrain your thinking
pattern to do that.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to imagine
a stressful situation.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Imagine something that's
caused you stress in the past.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So feel it, see it, immerse
yourself in that situation,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you're
perfectly safe right now.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you're
visualizing it, I'd

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.730 align:middle line:84%
like you to take in
some deep breaths

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself relaxing
and calmly handling

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:34.110 align:middle line:84%
the situation, all
the time feeling

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:90%
confident and in control.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
You are thinking
positive thoughts,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you'll handle the
situation just as you want to.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:90%
You're rational and in control.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You allow yourself
time to decompress,

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:84%
time to allow your
mind to unwind, time

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that you
don't have to be perfect.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do everything
at once, preferring now

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:23.470 align:middle line:84%
to take one day at a time,
helping you to feel calm

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.100 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed each and every day.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to gather
up your stress, worries,

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and anxieties from the
past, and one by one

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:90%
place them in a wooden box.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to hold onto
those thoughts and concerns

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.560 align:middle line:84%
as there's no looking
back and dwelling now.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.265 align:middle line:84%
See yourself placing that
wooden box into a fire.

00:19:53.265 --> 00:19:57.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.810 align:middle line:90%
Feel the heat.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.320 align:middle line:90%
See the glow of the fire.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.880 align:middle line:84%
You don't get too
close, but you watch

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:84%
as the box and all your
worries and stresses simply

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
disintegrate, never
to be ignited again.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment now to watch the
books and all of your stress

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety disappear.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:90%
You have taken control back.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And you're ready
to embrace tomorrow

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:84%
with a fresh, positive mind,
feeling calm and relaxed

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.150 align:middle line:84%
taking each day one by one,
recognizing that stress

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:90%
no longer serves you.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
Now whenever you need to
feel calm and relaxed,

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:84%
you immediately start deep
breathing long breaths

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
in and out to help
regulate your heartbeat,

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:84%
to help regulate your oxygen
levels and your hormones.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
You breathe in for 4, hold for
4, and simply exhale for 6.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So do it with me now
in for one, 2, 3, 4.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.960 align:middle line:90%
Hold for 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And slowly out for
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And over time finding a
place that's right for you,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.720 align:middle line:84%
but knowing that you can trust
in this breathing technique.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.560 align:middle line:84%
In for 4, hold for
4 and out for 6.

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps what you once
saw as a stressful situation,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:84%
you now see as a challenge
you can overcome as you now

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:05.740 align:middle line:84%
have the resilience you need
to get through this, taking

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:12.730 align:middle line:84%
each day one at a time, feeling
more and more resilient,

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.980 align:middle line:84%
having the ability
now to bounce back,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:90%
to pick yourself up and succeed.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
As you believe in
yourself, you believe

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%

with new energy and optimism.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:90%

You feel powerful,
confident, relaxed,

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.575 align:middle line:90%
and calm, and in control.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't allow any
more negative thinking

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.030 align:middle line:84%
as you know this is
toxic to your behavior.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
From now on, your thinking
is filled with positivity.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.410 align:middle line:90%

embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.070 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count from 1 up to 5

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.120 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%

alert, and feeling fantastic,

Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:54.368 align:middle line:90%
