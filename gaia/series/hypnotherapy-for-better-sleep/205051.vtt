00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to
House of Wellbeing.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.410 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the "Anxiety
Release" hypnotherapy audio.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But before it does,
I'd like to remind you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
that the following
audio contains

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.633 align:middle line:84%
aim to help you reach a
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that, wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.493 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions, where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.318 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:53.318 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But right now,
there's nothing at all

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.710 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.050 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back, and let go.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy all
those peaceful feelings

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and all the benefits
that come with it.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.660 align:middle line:90%
They don't matter at all.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
And you can dismiss them
out of your awareness

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.275 align:middle line:84%
and focus your mind
entirely on what I'm saying.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and
you make the most of it.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.390 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs
as much as you can.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.445 align:middle line:90%
And let it out slowly.

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And again, take in
a long, slow breath.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to normal, gentle
breaths in and out,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.715 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:02:50.715 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.465 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.005 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.520 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.520 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you are as

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:90%
long as it feels good to you.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.265 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
There's a breeze gently
blowing over you,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.080 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing, healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly, you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.365 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.750 align:middle line:84%
from the sun over your face,
just relaxing those muscles

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.685 align:middle line:84%
around the eyes, around the
nose and mouth and your brow.

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.680 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, you find
that your facial muscles

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.150 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's a beautiful day.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.320 align:middle line:84%
You move the light from the
sun into the throat area,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders, making them

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:84%
feel loose and limp
and comfortable

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
as your shoulders sink into
the frame of your body.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.005 align:middle line:84%
And you feel so comfortable
now, so relaxed and at peace.

00:05:55.005 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And you let nothing bother
or concern you at all.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.520 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.690 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the nerves and bones
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.180 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.295 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.665 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relaxed.

00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest,
all the muscles there.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relaxing your tummy,

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.290 align:middle line:84%
down into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
A light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light
from the sun down

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
your right leg, up and down
from the top of the hips

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:84%
to the tips of your toes
as the right leg relaxes

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.860 align:middle line:90%
and you let go.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You now move the light
into your left leg.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:25.750 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and down the left
leg, from the top of the hips

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:84%
And your left leg relaxes,
releasing tension,

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.040 align:middle line:90%
letting go now completely.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.730 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your
head all the way down

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.170 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes,
your mind also relaxes.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed, but still completely

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.205 align:middle line:90%
alert and aware.

00:09:18.205 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Your mind is thoroughly relaxed.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.565 align:middle line:84%
But you stay focused
on these words.

00:09:28.565 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and
gentle breeze in the air,

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
making you feel pleasantly
relaxed and calm.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:84%
All around, you can see
trees and plants and an array

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
of the most beautiful
flowers you have ever seen,

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.820 align:middle line:84%
so colorful and
vibrant and you can

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.270 align:middle line:84%
smell the rich aroma
of these flowers,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.260 align:middle line:90%
Nothing else matters right now.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.005 align:middle line:84%
You feel completely
at ease and so calm.

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:34.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.180 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.115 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
loosening more and more,

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.595 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with the beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:10:56.595 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%


00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.895 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity, you decide to
follow the sound of the water.

00:11:04.895 --> 00:11:07.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And you feel excited about where
it's leading you, knowing deep

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
within yourself you're going
to a very special place,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
a place where you're
going to create

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.055 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long-lasting changes.

00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.700 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:90%
You feel totally at ease.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake, you

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.230 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen,

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
and you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.980 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.172 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:09.172 --> 00:12:12.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.880 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
you take, feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.660 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out,

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently,

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.870 align:middle line:84%
flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance,
and you can see a wooden bridge

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.045 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:12:54.045 --> 00:12:56.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge,
feeling more and more

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge, you can see

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:08.602 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:08.602 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start
walking over the bridge,

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%
counting the steps in your mind.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:90%
10, 9.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:90%
Deeper and deeper still.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.610 align:middle line:90%
8, 7.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
All the way down
to relaxation now.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:90%
6, 5, and 4.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Drifting off
peacefully and easily.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.790 align:middle line:90%
3, 2.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
All the way down,
deeply relaxed.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable
padded chair,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and you take a seat,
ready to embrace

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
the changes to come in your
deep state of relaxation now.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:84%
You may be feeling particularly
anxious at the moment.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're having feelings
of being out of control

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:90%
or overwhelmed or fearful.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.730 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps events seem too
difficult to manage or perhaps

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:84%
even too many different things
or too many different people

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.700 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We know that anxiety
is healthy and normal,

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
and it happens to all
of us some of the time.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is a
response in your body

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to make you alert, prepared,
and ready to act when it's

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
necessary for your benefit.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
But for now, you've
allowed your anxiety

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
to become too
alert, too fearful,

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's now time to allow
your anxiety some time

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
to refocus, review,
to do its job better,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:90%
return to helping you.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
do that right now.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:23.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're conscious of the
gentle beating of your heart

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
and the steady rhythm
of each breath,

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:38.485 align:middle line:84%
breathing gently and
slowly, slowly and evenly.

00:15:38.485 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's time to
realize that you

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
are in control of your
thoughts as your beliefs

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
are just thoughts that have
been thought over time and time

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you've been thinking
too much that you're not

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:84%
good enough or
you've been worrying

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.630 align:middle line:84%
about something
out of your control

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:10.095 align:middle line:84%
or a situation, fear, or phobia
has been holding you back.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:84%
We can simply replace those
old, unwanted thoughts, now,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:84%
with new, empowering,
positive ones.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
It's time, now, to stop
imagining the worst

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.350 align:middle line:84%
is about to happen when
good things await you.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.970 align:middle line:84%
As we free ourselves
now of panic or anxiety

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.330 align:middle line:84%
or whichever symptoms have
been generated in the past,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.580 align:middle line:84%
we replace them with
feelings of calmness,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
feelings of confidence, control,
and optimism for the future.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And every time you discharge one
of those symptoms of anxiety,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
you will replace
them with a feeling

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
of being calm,
relaxed, optimistic,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.630 align:middle line:90%
and confident for things ahead.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
You know that anxiety and
fear are very different.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Fear is what you
feel in the moment--

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
when you're watching a
scary film, for example.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And fear makes a lot of sense.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
But anxiety's about the
anticipation of an event.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety is your brain asking
what if too many times

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and coming up with a lot
of answers it doesn't like.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:90%
But you don't know the future.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
That what-if may
not even happen.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So anxiety is often
problem solving,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:90%
but without the solving part.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.420 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you no
longer worry about things

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that may happen in the
future, things that might

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.420 align:middle line:90%
make you feel out of control.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And you learn to live much
more in the moment, day

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
by day, as you take
each day at a time,

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.835 align:middle line:90%
being present and mindful.

00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And you release the
tension of worrying

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.720 align:middle line:84%
about things in the future
that you can't control.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.520 align:middle line:90%
You take each day at a time.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
You remember that the body can't
fail two conflicting emotions

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.490 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you feel yourself
tensing or anxiety rising,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:90%
all you need to do is slow down.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:90%
And breathe out.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:00.190 align:middle line:90%
And allow your body to relax.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
If you have your
breathing under control,

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.520 align:middle line:84%
gentle breaths in and
out, your body and mind

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.090 align:middle line:84%
will have no choice but to
slow down, to ground yourself.

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Your thinking will slow.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Your heartbeat returns
to its normal pace.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Those feelings of
anxiety will be

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
replaced with calm and
stillness, gentle breaths

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.270 align:middle line:90%
in and out again.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's do a breathing
technique now.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to breathe
in for four seconds,

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:84%
hold for four seconds,
and breathe out for six,

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.260 align:middle line:90%
starting now.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:90%
Breathe in for 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:55.050 align:middle line:90%
Hold for 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:20:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And release for 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And you find a pace
that's right for you,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.850 align:middle line:84%
but using that
technique to calm you,

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.280 align:middle line:84%
to ground you when your
thoughts and your mind

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:90%
seem out of control--

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.695 align:middle line:84%
in for four, hold for
four, and out for six.

00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:23.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you feel
anxious now, you simply

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
use that breathing
technique to flip the body

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:34.060 align:middle line:84%
from feeling anxious into a
state of calm and relaxation.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You feel yourself free, such
a relief, such a release.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Taking every day as it
comes, taking back control,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
feeling more and more in
control each and every day.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
You take a couple of
deep, refreshing breaths

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:04.450 align:middle line:84%
in and out, perhaps
imagining breathing in calm,

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.800 align:middle line:84%
pure, air, remembering
anxiety is simply

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:84%
an old, primitive response,
which needs help to escape.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you exhale, you're
exhaling any feelings

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.115 align:middle line:90%
of anxiety, stress, and panic.

00:21:19.115 --> 00:21:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can relax your body
if ever those old feelings

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.160 align:middle line:84%
of panic return, breathing
deeply and calmly,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:84%
retraining your mind to slow
down instead of speed up,

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:84%
rewiring those
thinking patterns,

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body
and mind to relax

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.100 align:middle line:90%
as you regain control now.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.410 align:middle line:84%
When you inhale in
this way, your breath

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:84%
pushes deep into your
abdomen, deep, deep down.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.780 align:middle line:84%
You take slow, deep breaths
to regulate your breathing

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and slowly let it go, whilst all
the same time telling yourself

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:90%
to feel calm and relaxed.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.620 align:middle line:90%
I am calm.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:90%
I am confident.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I am strong.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I am calm.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:90%
I am confident.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.780 align:middle line:90%
I am strong.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.105 align:middle line:84%
You immediately feel much
calmer and much more relaxed.

00:22:27.105 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.930 align:middle line:84%
You realize now that you
are not your thoughts.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Your thoughts are
merely old habits,

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.600 align:middle line:84%
beliefs that have been formed
if they've been repeated

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.360 align:middle line:90%
in your mind again and again.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So you decide to think
new, positive thoughts now,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:84%
empowering thoughts,
confident thoughts that

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:84%
will equip you to stay calm and
relaxed throughout your day.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And as you think these
positive thoughts more often,

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.260 align:middle line:84%
you slowly compound and
replace the old beliefs of I'm

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.790 align:middle line:84%
feeling anxious to feeling
calm and relaxed, rewiring

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:90%
those thinking patterns now.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.740 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you find yourself
thinking negatively,

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.950 align:middle line:90%
you immediately replace--

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.620 align:middle line:84%
I am feeling calm
and confident--

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.390 align:middle line:84%
thinking more
positively day by day.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Your mind commands,
and your body obeys.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell yourself
that you're calm and relaxed,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.700 align:middle line:84%
you instantly
experience that calm,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.040 align:middle line:84%
relaxed feeling in your
body, taking back control.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.320 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And if you ever feel any of
that old anxiety creeping up

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:84%
on you, all you need to do
is those breathing exercises

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
as quickly as possible,
reminding yourself

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:90%
you can regulate your breathing.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
You can relax your whole body.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.485 align:middle line:84%
You can, and you do,
immediately grounding yourself.

00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
You remember to check
your body for tension.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And you release it.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Check your shoulders and neck,
letting your shoulders droop

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.155 align:middle line:90%
and relax.

00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:36.670 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.590 align:middle line:84%
You check your
jaw, and you allow

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:43.580 align:middle line:84%
it to hang loosely,
your forehead becoming

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:90%
smooth and relaxed.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You check your abdomen, letting
each breath relax your stomach.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And each deep breath
relaxes your stomach

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:90%
more and more deeply.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:05.310 align:middle line:84%
You relax any part of your
body that feels the tension,

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.310 align:middle line:90%
letting it go.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:10.640 align:middle line:90%


00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.730 align:middle line:84%
You always remember
that you are in charge.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
You have the ability, the
tools, and the knowledge

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.515 align:middle line:84%
to let go of all of that
old, unnecessary anxiety.

00:25:21.515 --> 00:25:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel confident,
calm, and relaxed.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.000 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you find yourself
feeling much calmer and much

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.820 align:middle line:84%
more relaxed and so
much more confident

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
as those old anxieties begin to
diminish because you know, now,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:90%
exactly how to deal with them.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And after a few times of
practicing these techniques,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.640 align:middle line:84%
those old, unwanted
responses will

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.740 align:middle line:84%
change as a new response
pattern sets in,

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
a pattern of coping, taking
control of feeling wonderfully

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.930 align:middle line:90%
relaxed and at ease.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps they're
even changing now

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.120 align:middle line:90%
as you listen to me.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
If you instinctively know
that you can do this,

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.780 align:middle line:90%
you can take control.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.300 align:middle line:84%
You can be in charge of
your mind, your body,

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.120 align:middle line:90%
and your health.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you, now, to think of a
situation that would previously

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.540 align:middle line:84%
have caused you
to feel anxious--

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that is, before you learned
these new coping strategies.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Picture yourself at a future
date in a similar situation

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and see yourself in the
situation, what you can hear,

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:90%
see, and smell.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And notice that you're
behaving differently this time.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:90%
You're much more in control.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Your body is calm and
relaxed, and you're speaking

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:04.310 align:middle line:90%
calmly and confidently.

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Your anxiety is so faint,
you can barely perceive it.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.850 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself, now,
coping brilliantly.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:90%


00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Feel yourself taking that
long, slow, deep breath,

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
filling your mind
with positivity,

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:84%
telling yourself you
are calm and relaxed.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And notice how you
instantly respond

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:84%
in a positive, healthy way,
feeling wonderfully calm,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:90%
relaxed, and in control.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.510 align:middle line:90%
And

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.990 align:middle line:84%
You know instinctively
that this works for you,

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.180 align:middle line:90%
that you can feel good.

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:84%
You can be relaxed, free
from any unwanted feelings,

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.000 align:middle line:84%
replacing them easily
and effortlessly

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
with calm and
confident feelings.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.255 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited, now,
to put these new feelings

00:27:58.255 --> 00:27:59.055 align:middle line:90%
into practice.

00:27:59.055 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.372 align:middle line:84%
embedded into your
subconscious mind,

00:28:10.372 --> 00:28:12.080 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.900 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.390 align:middle line:84%
alert, and feeling
fantastic, bringing back

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.720 align:middle line:84%
with you all the
wonderful new feelings.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.020 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
