00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Make yourself
really comfortable now.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your eyes
open for a minute and sort

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:84%
of look upwards,
but you don't have

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.450 align:middle line:90%
to look at anything special.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I'll count downwards
from 10 to 1,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.675 align:middle line:84%
and you can just blink your eyes
slowly, like in a slow motion

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:40.475 align:middle line:90%
with every number.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
10, that's right, just
blink really slowly.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:01:07.950 align:middle line:84%
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, blinking with
every number, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Now you can close your
eyes, and keep them close,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you
why we did that.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.370 align:middle line:84%
That was just to
relax your eyelids.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And right now in
your eyelids, you

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:84%
might notice a tired feeling,
a pleasant feeling, or a sort

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:90%
of comfortable, heavy feeling.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.530 align:middle line:84%
You can pretend that this
heavy or tight feeling

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
is spreading out and going
to other parts of your body.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:90%


00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
See if you can imagine
the feeling going

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
to your face and your head
to your arms and hands,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to your chest and your back,
then down through your legs

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.535 align:middle line:84%
and feet, even all the way
out to the tips of your toes.

00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:84%
And soon, you may begin
to feel heavy or light,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:84%
but heavy or light
in a nice way,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
being relaxed means.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.410 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do anything at all.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
You can hear my voice,
but you don't really

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:90%
have to listen to it.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.087 align:middle line:84%
You can hear my voice,
but at the same time

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
you could be doing other
things like quietly

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:90%
playing in your mind.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter as long as you're

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
resting and comfortable
with your eyes shut.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you find yourself
drifting into a nice sleep

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.660 align:middle line:84%
as you listen to the
sound of my voice,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
and my voice can even become
part of the background

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.930 align:middle line:84%
at times, fading in
and out as dreams

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.690 align:middle line:90%
come dancing before your eyes.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you can imagine
yourself playing safely

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
on a lovely sandy beach,
running in the sunshine

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
after a beach ball, building
sandcastles, or searching

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.410 align:middle line:84%
for shells and
fossils, or maybe even

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.135 align:middle line:90%
baby crabs in the rock holes.

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful warm
day but not too hot

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
because there are one or two
white fluffy clouds in the sky.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to look
carefully at those clouds,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
you'd be able to imagine
certain shapes forming, perhaps

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.678 align:middle line:84%
the figure of someone lying
down just as you do in bed

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:47.845 align:middle line:90%
when you're ready for sleep.

00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Or they could look like
a pair of giant eagles

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.540 align:middle line:84%
keeping guard of the sea or
anything you want them to be.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.330 align:middle line:84%
If you're making
castles in the sand,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.470 align:middle line:84%
you may notice that sand
getting cooler as you dig down.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
dig down, the cooler

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
it all gets deeper
and deeper down.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there are
friends around you,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps you have a very
special friend from school

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:84%
who you'd like to play with,
or a cousin, or brother,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:90%
or sister.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Whoever you want to
be with you is there,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.300 align:middle line:90%
almost as if by magic.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you're paddling in
the shallow part of the sea,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:90%
taking care as you do.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.505 align:middle line:84%
Splashing, and laughing,
and playing, having fun

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:48.305 align:middle line:90%
with your friends.

00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
You can even taste the
salt in the sea air

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.320 align:middle line:84%
and feel that gentle breeze
on your skin and your hair,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and it's so nice and fresh.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
You feel so happy that you
want to tell your friends how

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
you feel, and it feels so good
to be alive just to be you

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
because you're a
very special person

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and your life is
surrounded by love.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
As you play in the
water, run on the sand,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're
doing, you can

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
hear the sound of the waves
going back and forth, back

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.140 align:middle line:90%
and forth, back and forth.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And you're aware of
your breathing slowly

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and rhythmically,
in and out, just

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.860 align:middle line:90%
like those waves in the ocean.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
The warm sand feels
good on your feet,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and you like making footprints
in the sand, especially

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
those parts that have
not been trodden on yet.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy the feeling
of your feet sinking deep,

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.010 align:middle line:90%
deep down in the sand.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Now take in a long deep breath,
and you can feel very quiet.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything around you becomes
quiet and still and very

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.030 align:middle line:90%
safe and secure.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:84%
For a few moments, just enjoy
this quiet, safe stillness,

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be quiet too.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And when I start
talking again, you

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.135 align:middle line:84%
find yourself feeling even
more comfortable and relaxed.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
From now on in, whenever
you go to sleep,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.580 align:middle line:84%
you imagine a big, safe,
protective, and visible bubble

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
surrounding you.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's smooth, and
round, clear, and airy.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So when you're in
your bed at night,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:84%
your protective
bubble is all around

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:23.850 align:middle line:84%
you, all around your bed, or
wherever you may be sleeping.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.160 align:middle line:90%
You're safe and secure.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to give
this bubble a color,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.650 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's your favorite
color or multiple colors.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it has a pattern or
texture that you love on it.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you decide
to give it a name.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very
special bubble.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Only you can see it, and it
doesn't allow any bad thoughts

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.360 align:middle line:90%
or bad dreams to enter it.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in your bed
and you close your eyes,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
you now visualize, imagine
your protective bubble

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:84%
all around you, and you
know nothing bad can happen

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:90%
to you inside your bubble.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:84%
You're perfectly safe, and only
good dreams and good thoughts

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:90%
happen here.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
You know the bubble is made
of really strong material

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.804 align:middle line:84%
when nothing bad
can get through,

00:08:27.804 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
no negative thoughts, no bad
people or things to scare you.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Only you have the power to
walk in and out of the bubble.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.730 align:middle line:84%
As darkness comes, you start
to feel safe and secure,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.040 align:middle line:84%
knowing that soon you'll
be inside your bubble

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
safe and protected.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.005 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer
concerned about darkness.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.690 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You like it when it's dark
outside because it means

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
you'll sleep better, and you
know that a good night's sleep

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
makes you feel rested
with more energy

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.630 align:middle line:84%
to do the things you
want to do the next day.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:84%
You know your family and
friends are all safe.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.575 align:middle line:84%
They're either downstairs
or in another room.

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps they're
out and you're

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.970 align:middle line:84%
with grandparents, or other
family members, or friends.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.755 align:middle line:84%
Wherever your
family is, you know

00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
that they are adults
who love you very much

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:84%
and will always protect
you at night and keep you

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and themselves safe and well.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.612 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.612 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And you take another
deep breath in

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.235 align:middle line:84%
and relax, knowing that
all is well in your world.

00:09:45.235 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
You rest easily knowing
that everything is perfect

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and just as it should be.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
inside this bubble

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:84%
tucked up ready to
sleep, your head

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
becomes full of
lovely happy thoughts,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.040 align:middle line:84%
thinking of good things
that may have happened

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to you during the day
or the week, nice things

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
that you've done with
your family or friends,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.470 align:middle line:84%
or simply remembering beautiful
things you have seen or heard.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you did something
fun which made you smile

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.283 align:middle line:84%
or you remember a time
you laughed really hard

00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.200 align:middle line:90%
and you couldn't stop.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.225 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you remember times
with friends that you enjoy.

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Inside your safe,
protective bubble,

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
you feel happiness and
only happy thoughts.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.160 align:middle line:84%
All those bad thoughts get
sucked out by the bubble

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.610 align:middle line:84%
before they have time to
worry you or make you anxious,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.636 align:middle line:84%
leaving only good
things to think about.

00:11:02.636 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:84%
You have no time for
bad thoughts anymore.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.290 align:middle line:84%
You realize that there's
no point in having them.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:90%
So you let them go.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.600 align:middle line:84%
You push them out
of your bubble,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.190 align:middle line:84%
preferring to think about good
things that make you smile now.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Your imagination is
strong inside the bubble,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
and you become more
creative, making up things

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
to think and dream about,
only happy positive things,

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:84%
letting your mind play
out ideas like you

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.990 align:middle line:84%
were a writer of a
new movie or new book.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you think about your
favorite movie or favorite book

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and how you'd adapt it
to make it even better.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Or you may even think about a
new film or book from scratch

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.995 align:middle line:90%
or from the beginning.

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you like to
imagine yourself

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
building something
in your dreams,

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:84%
or drawing, or
creating something.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
This is your special time
to be creative to use

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.480 align:middle line:84%
your imagination and do anything
that inspires and excites you.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you like to go on
adventures in your dreams.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself going
to faraway countries,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
visiting places
you've heard about

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and imagining what
they might be like.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:41.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:47.060 align:middle line:84%
You could be a champion horse
rider, underwater swimmer,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:90%
the fastest racing driver.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.330 align:middle line:84%
You can be anything you
want to be when you sleep.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And you realize now that you're
in control of your thinking,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in control of your dreams as the
bubble acts like a time machine

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
transporting you to
new places, allowing

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
you to go anywhere you desire,
be anything you want to be,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.020 align:middle line:84%
all the time feeling
free and safe.

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.680 align:middle line:84%
You love going to
bed at night now

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and you love going
to sleep, and you

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:90%
fall asleep easily and quickly.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:84%
You feel excited about the
adventures and the good dreams

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:90%
you're going to have.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.460 align:middle line:84%
When you fall asleep,
you sleep all night

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:90%
without waking up in the night.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.710 align:middle line:84%
You close your eyes and wake
up in the morning at the time

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:43.810 align:middle line:90%
you need to wake up.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And when you sleep, you're
on too many adventures,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
doing too many brilliant
things to wake up too soon.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
And you much prefer
to have a long sleep.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you do wake
up in the night,

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.830 align:middle line:84%
you simply remember your
protective bubble is all around

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.430 align:middle line:84%
you, and you easily
and gently go back

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to sleep and back to your
exciting adventure or dream.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're grateful for
your protective bubble that

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.760 align:middle line:90%
brings you happiness and joy.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Each and every day, you
feel happier, more calm,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:36.600 align:middle line:84%
more positive about life,
knowing that you're always safe

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
and that bedtime is a safe place
where good things happen now.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And each time you
listen to this audio,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.325 align:middle line:84%
all those thoughts become more
and more powerful in your mind.

00:14:50.325 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And you find it more and more
easy to drift off to sleep,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
knowing that you're
safe and secure.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you're asleep, you can
allow your body to gently stay

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.560 align:middle line:90%
in that lovely relaxed state.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you're ready to awaken,
I'm going to count from 1 to 5.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And at the count to 5, you
can allow your eyes to open,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and you will be feeling
refreshed and alert, positive

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:29.270 align:middle line:84%
about bedtime, bringing back
with your little wonderful new

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:90%
feelings.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open if you're ready.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:90%
