00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You are listening to the
Increase in Exercise Mind

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Talk audio.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:84%
In a moment the
hypnosis will begin.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
But before it
does, I'd just like

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.740 align:middle line:84%
to remind you that the
following audio contains

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic
suggestions that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:90%
aim to cause deep relaxation.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.560 align:middle line:84%
will alert you and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
that you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:90%
relax, lie back and let go.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
And really enjoy those peaceful
feelings and all the benefits

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%
that come with it.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now
to make yourself

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
as comfortable as
possible and listen

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
to the sound of my voice.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And as you do so, you may be
aware of other sounds going on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.735 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:40.040 align:middle line:84%
But you know that
they're not important,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.770 align:middle line:84%
they don't matter at all
and you can dismiss them out

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of your awareness, and
focus your mind entirely

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.615 align:middle line:90%
on what I'm saying.

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:53.730 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
This is your time and
you make the most of it.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240 align:middle line:84%
No one needs or wants
anything from you at all.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you to
take in a deep breath,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
filling your lungs as much as
you can and let it out slowly.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.945 align:middle line:84%
And again taking a
long, slow breath.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
let it out slowly.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Now you can allow your
breathing to return to normal.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Gentle breaths in and out.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.025 align:middle line:84%
Returning to your normal
gentle breathing pace.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:57.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to imagine yourself

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.030 align:middle line:84%
outside in your favorite
place in nature.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a peaceful
tropical beach

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.830 align:middle line:84%
or it could be a
beautiful garden.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
imagine lying back

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:84%
on a boat which is sailing
on a tranquil river.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It really doesn't
matter where you

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.615 align:middle line:84%
are as long as it feels good to
you and it's a beautiful day.

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
The sky is a special
shade of blue, so clear.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's a warm summer's day.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.190 align:middle line:84%
As a breeze gently blowing
over you and the temperature

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:90%
is just how you like it.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And in the sky is
a dazzling sun,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.060 align:middle line:84%
so bright that you just
want to close your eyes

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and feel the glowing healing
warmth of the sun on your body.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And surprisingly you find
that you can direct that sun

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%
over and around your body.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And as you realize
this, you begin

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to direct the light from
the sun over your face.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the healing
warmth of the light

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:90%
from the sun over your face.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Just relaxing those
muscles around the eyes,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
around the nose and
mouth, and your brow.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And as you do this, you find
that your facial muscles

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
begin to flatten out
as they relax and you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.120 align:middle line:90%
let go completely.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful day, you
move the light from the sun

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:90%
into the throat area.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
Feeling the warmth of the light
from the sun in your throat,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.860 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the muscles, just
letting go completely now.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And the warm sunlight now
moving into your shoulders

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and across your
shoulders making them

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.700 align:middle line:84%
feel lose and limp
and comfortable.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:06:00.350 align:middle line:84%
As your show to sink into
the frame of your body

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.900 align:middle line:90%
and you feel so comfortable now.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So relax to neckpiece and do you
let nothing bother or concern

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:90%
you at all.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And you direct the light from
the sun down your right arm,

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
from the shoulders to
the tips of your fingers.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And right arm begins
to relax and let go.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a beautiful feeling
to be here right now.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.840 align:middle line:84%
The warmth of the
light from the sun

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
penetrates the knives and bones,
and muscles of that right arm.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's such a beautiful day.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
You move the sun
over to your left arm

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and guide the light from the
sun down and up your left arm.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.230 align:middle line:84%
From the top of your
shoulders all the way down

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your fingers.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:84%
You can feel the left arm
relaxing, becoming comfortably

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.990 align:middle line:90%
heavy and totally relax.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:31.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Now move that warm light
across and into the chest area,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.562 align:middle line:84%
and relax the chest
all the muscles there.

00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Now down to the stomach,
relax in your tummy

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and down into your hips and your
thighs over to your right leg.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
A light warms the muscles
as you relax your right leg.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Let it feel comfortable
and heavy now.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Now move the light from the
sun down your right leg,

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
up and down from the top of the
hips to the tips of your toes.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.025 align:middle line:84%
As the right leg
relaxes and you let go.

00:08:20.025 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a beautiful
day, you now move the light

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
into your left leg.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.669 align:middle line:84%
You move it up and
down the left leg.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.960 align:middle line:84%
From the top of the hips to
the tips of your toes and

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.600 align:middle line:90%
your left leg relaxes.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Releasing tension,
letting go now completely.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Your whole body is now totally
and completely relaxed.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
From the top of your
head all the way down

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.500 align:middle line:90%
to the tips of your toes.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And as your body relaxes
your mind also relaxes.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:15.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And I want you now to
notice that the sun is

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:25.790 align:middle line:84%
setting, going down now,
deeper and deeper down.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And you're so deeply
relaxed but still

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.545 align:middle line:90%
completely alert and aware.

00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:84%
You resist the temptation
to fall asleep.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is thoroughly
relaxed but you

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.905 align:middle line:90%
stay focused on these words.

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So now I'd like you to
use your imagination

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and once again, you're in a
wonderful place in nature.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The trees are a
beautiful shade of green.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a stunning day and the
sun is shining down on you.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a soft and gentle breeze
in the air making you feel

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.215 align:middle line:90%
pleasantly relaxed and calm.

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
All around you can
see trees and plants,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and an array of the
most beautiful flowers

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.715 align:middle line:90%
you have ever seen.

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:24.250 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:84%
So colorful and
vibrant, and you can

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
smell the rich aroma
of these flowers

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.430 align:middle line:90%
making you feel so peaceful.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.750 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else matters right
now, you feel completely

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.330 align:middle line:90%
at ease and so calm.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And in the distance, you
can hear the sound of water

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.435 align:middle line:90%
flowing slowly and gently.

00:10:51.435 --> 00:10:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.820 align:middle line:84%
The sound of water is helping
you to go more and more deeply

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.620 align:middle line:90%
relaxed.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.470 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
You may feel your muscles
are loosening more and more,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.935 align:middle line:84%
relaxing with a beautiful
flowing sound of water.

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Out of curiosity you decide to
follow the sound of the water

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.870 align:middle line:84%
and you feel excited about
where it's leading you.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Knowing deep within
yourself you're

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
going into a very special place.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.100 align:middle line:84%
A place where you're
going to create

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.385 align:middle line:84%
some positive, wonderful,
long lasting changes.

00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:38.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
As you walk slowly
towards the water

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.030 align:middle line:84%
you can hear the sound of
birds singing in the trees,

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.815 align:middle line:90%
you feel totally at ease.

00:11:49.815 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.840 align:middle line:84%
As you finally
reach the lake you

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
realize it's the most beautiful
vision you've ever seen.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're in awe of the
beauty that surrounds you.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
The vast lake is
filled with a variety

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of colors, rich colors of blues,
turquoise, and light greens.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And it fills your mind and
body with a wave of relaxation.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
You may be becoming more relaxed
with each and every breath

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.070 align:middle line:90%
you take.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Feeling more calm,
more peaceful, and more

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.015 align:middle line:90%
relaxed than ever before.

00:12:38.015 --> 00:12:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Your mind may be
drifting in and out.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Just letting go deeper
and deeper still.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:84%
You may feel as though your
mind is flowing gently.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.190 align:middle line:84%
Flowing gently like the
lake in your imagination.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.060 align:middle line:84%
You look into the distance and
you can see a wooden bridge

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.365 align:middle line:90%
leading over the lake.

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.910 align:middle line:84%
You walk towards the bridge
feeling more and more

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:12.900 align:middle line:90%
deeply relaxed.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
As you reach the
bridge you can see

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 steps leading over
to the other side of the lake.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
You slowly start walking
over the bridge counting

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:38.820 align:middle line:84%
the steps in your mind ten,
nine, deeper and deeper still.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Eight, seven all the way
down to relaxation now.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Six, five, and four drifting
off peacefully and easily.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Three, two all the way down
deeply relaxed and one.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
You see a comfortable padded
chair when you take a seat.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Ready to embrace the changes
to come in your deep state

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
of relaxation now.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
You know that working
out is important

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:84%
because you know how
exercise is good for you.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.860 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, it
seems as though a part of you

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to workout.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can't really
see yourself as motivated

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you're waiting for the
right time to start exercising.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Exercising regularly
may seem challenging,

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
but imagine how you
would feel if you

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
had the drive and
the determination

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.790 align:middle line:90%
to exercise consistently.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Hypnotherapy is your
key to opening the door

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to your subconscious and
to changing your thinking

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Fueling your passion and drive
to exercise, and desire to make

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:90%
exercise a part of your life.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do to
stop making those changes

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is sit back, close your
eyes and get comfortable.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Focus inwards and let your
mind accept the new thinking

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.402 align:middle line:84%
patterns of drive
and motivation.

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
You realize that in order
to increase your stamina

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.590 align:middle line:84%
you will need to be in the
right frame of mind, which

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so important to
you that your mental outlook is

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
much improved.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:84%
You also know that the food
you eat is so important,

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
so your body is
filled for exercise.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
You begin eating small and
frequent healthy nutritious

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.900 align:middle line:90%
meals.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And you eat slowly
and deliberately

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:84%
allowing your body to digest
and enjoy each mouthful.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.375 align:middle line:84%
And when you've had enough to
eat, you simply stop eating.

00:16:42.375 --> 00:16:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's as easy
as simple as that

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.155 align:middle line:84%
when you've got your
mindset and the right state.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:04.670 align:middle line:84%
You also fill your mind with
positive thoughts and feelings,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:84%
removing as much negativity
from your life as you can.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
And from now on try
and surround yourself

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.329 align:middle line:84%
with things that inspire
you and make you feel good.

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
That make you feel like you
want to get up and move.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:84%
You start to enjoy the
feeling in your body

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:84%
as you create more movement
even if it's fast walking.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Now is the time to reignite
and rediscover your love

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:90%
and passion for exercise.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Imagine now that you are
in a beautiful garden

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
and you may notice
how there are trees

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:90%
and how colorful they are.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.345 align:middle line:84%
Beautiful, colorful flowers
and how the skies are clear.

00:17:59.345 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.985 align:middle line:84%
Take a look down at the grass
and see how beautiful and lush

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:07.785 align:middle line:90%
it looks.

00:18:07.785 --> 00:18:12.540 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.005 align:middle line:84%
You take a lie down on
the soft cushioned grass.

00:18:16.005 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:90%


00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:84%
You feel the warm air
move down your body

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:26.480 align:middle line:84%
from the top of your head
to the tips of your toes.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And really take in the power
of that relaxation now.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:39.940 align:middle line:84%
You realize that when you
exercise you feel good,

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
you are energized, and you
feel a rush of endorphins.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.515 align:middle line:84%
You feel strong
and full of energy.

00:18:48.515 --> 00:18:51.480 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.810 align:middle line:84%
Exercise will make you
not only feel great

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.410 align:middle line:84%
but it will help you
to look even better.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Your body will start
to change and you're

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.430 align:middle line:90%
excited about those changes.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.750 align:middle line:84%
You know that you feel
stronger on the inside

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and your body reflects that
too with strength and tone

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:90%
and muscle.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And you're excited to
get that feeling back

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:84%
and you enjoy that rush and
glow after a workout session.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:84%
Being fit and healthy
makes you feel great

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and you're excited to push
yourself to meet your goals.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to start
exercising as much as possible

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.370 align:middle line:90%
within your time restrictions.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And from now on you make
sure that you find that time.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You find the time to
put yourself first,

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to put your health first, you
know that it makes you healthy.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And you're now motivated to
reach your full potential.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.950 align:middle line:84%
You remember the importance
and warm up exercises

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:84%
before pushing your
body to extreme,

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:90%
and you always adhere to this.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.420 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't
exercised for a while,

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.680 align:middle line:84%
you make sure that you build
up your routine gradually.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Adding more time and more energy
at subsequent workout sessions.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that
this is the only way

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to succeed while taking care
of your body and your mind.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:21:01.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And if at times you find
it hard to keep going,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
you recognize how worthwhile
this is going to be

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and you're not afraid
to push yourself

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:90%
just a little bit further.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Always a little bit
further stopping

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:90%
when it's time to stop.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But pushing if you
feel it's right

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:90%
and if you have it within you.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:38.210 align:middle line:84%
You are a capable strong
person, capable of exercising

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:90%
regularly.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:84%
You're motivated to be organized
enough to make the time

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.910 align:middle line:90%
to complete a workout regime.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself now waking
up or at a time of day

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:58.070 align:middle line:90%
that's suitable for you.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And visualize yourself
now getting change

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.900 align:middle line:90%
into your workout clothes.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
You feel excited about
the session you're

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.555 align:middle line:90%
about to embrace and complete.

00:22:10.555 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself during
your exercise session

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're proud of
what you're achieving,

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%
working towards your goals.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Giving yourself more
energy, more endorphins,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and that feeling of
achievement that you love.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now in
your workout session,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.480 align:middle line:84%
the changes in your body,
that feeling afterwards,

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.740 align:middle line:84%
the pride, the fulfillment,
the glow, the endorphins.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to
do that once again.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:84%
You're excited to
start a routine,

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
whether it's three times
a week or even more.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.980 align:middle line:84%
From now on you make
sure you find time

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.265 align:middle line:90%
to put yourself first.

00:23:04.265 --> 00:23:09.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Project that into an image,
project the feelings of pride,

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:18.330 align:middle line:84%
the wonderful sense of
accomplishment, attainment,

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and achievement.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
You recognize that you have
achieved this by yourself

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
with your own determination.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.070 align:middle line:84%
You're excited thinking
about your workout

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
and you can't wait
to get going with it.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Whether you exercise on
your own or with friends,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.870 align:middle line:84%
you know that you're becoming
more and more healthy.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Giving yourself more energy,
changing your body shape,

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.425 align:middle line:90%
and meeting those goals.

00:23:53.425 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:02.130 align:middle line:84%
You no longer want to sit,
to be stagnant, to feel lazy.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
From now on you're driven
by movement, strengthening

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.580 align:middle line:84%
of your muscles, your body
and your overall fitness

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:84%
These are now within
your top priorities.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You're passionate about
making the most of your time

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
and you want to use it to
the best of your ability.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And you know how
exercise makes you happy

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and you keep doing it.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that you always
find a way to exercise,

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:90%
whether you're at home or away.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Whether there's a gym
or just a simple room

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.910 align:middle line:84%
you know that there's
a way to exercise.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And from now on you make no
excuses for that motivation

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and determination
is too strong now.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.160 align:middle line:84%
You know that you
can use your own body

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.330 align:middle line:84%
weight to do some
fantastic exercises

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.975 align:middle line:90%
with some significant results.

00:25:15.975 --> 00:25:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you start to mix
up what type of exercise

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.870 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, you
start to vary it.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So you focus on sports or
whatever that suits you.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's yoga, or weights,
or running, or going to the gym

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you find something that
suits you and your body.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.500 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Once you find that form of
exercise that you enjoy,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.960 align:middle line:90%
you stick with it.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And then you mix it up, you
vary it, find something else.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.820 align:middle line:84%
You know that those
muscles in your body

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
need to be shocked into a
different form of exercise.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So you vary your exercise
and those muscles

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.450 align:middle line:84%
are strengthened in all
kinds of different ways.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy the
feeling of being

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.540 align:middle line:84%
able to do these different
exercises and the pride

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.575 align:middle line:84%
that you get after
your workout session.

00:26:25.575 --> 00:26:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
You determined now to
turn your life around

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and to start looking
after yourself.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.455 align:middle line:84%
Treating your body with a
love and respect it deserves.

00:26:40.455 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.710 align:middle line:84%
You surround yourself with
as many positive people

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.530 align:middle line:90%
as you can.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:84%
People who inspire
you and want you

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:90%
to be the best that you can be.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you find
yourself drawn

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:84%
to uplifting music, music that
inspires you and pushes you.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Have a think now about
what aspects of your life

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.385 align:middle line:84%
you may want to
work on and change.

00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:19.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the people
you surround yourself with,

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
the food you feel
in your body with,

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:84%
the music you're listening
to, the time of day

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.825 align:middle line:84%
you wake up, your goals,
your mental outlook.

00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
These are all things
you can change

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to
make that change now.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:51.620 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And each area that you
identify that needs to change

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
brings you a wonderful
feeling of quiet anticipation.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And these feelings help you
to feel even more comfortable,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.140 align:middle line:84%
even more relaxed
and happier than you

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
have felt in a long, long time.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.090 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:23.400 align:middle line:84%
From this moment onwards your
determination and motivation

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.080 align:middle line:84%
to increase your stamina
grows stronger and stronger.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Stronger by the day, stronger
by the hour, and stronger

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:33.030 align:middle line:90%
by the minute.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
These hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.280 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.730 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment I'm going
to count up from 1 to 5

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.020 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of five, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.960 align:middle line:90%
alert, and feeling fantastic.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Bringing back with you all of
the wonderful new feelings.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
Coming back now.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So one, two, three,
four, and five,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
eyes open when you're ready.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:90%
