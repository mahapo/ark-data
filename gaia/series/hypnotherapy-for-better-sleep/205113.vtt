[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to House
of Well-being.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
You're listening to the "Better
Sleep Hypnotherapy" audio.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.210 align:middle line:84%
In a moment, the hypnosis will
begin, but before it does,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to remind you that
the following audio contains

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:84%
powerful hypnotic suggestions
to help you reach a really

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:90%
deep level of relaxation.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So please be sure that wherever
you're listening to this audio,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:84%
you're in a safe and
comfortable place

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.453 align:middle line:84%
free from distractions where
you can fully relax and let go.

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:44.870 align:middle line:84%
Please don't listen to this
if you're driving or operating

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.680 align:middle line:90%
machinery.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Should there be an emergency,
your subconscious mind

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
will alert you, and you'll
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But right now there's
nothing at all

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:84%
you need to do apart
from close your eyes,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:84%
relax, lay back, and
let go and really enjoy

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.120 align:middle line:84%
those peaceful feelings and all
the benefits that come with it.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:84%
Make yourself as
comfortable as possible

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and concentrate on
the sound of my voice

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
and begin by drawing in
a long, slow, deep breath

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.970 align:middle line:90%
in through your nose.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Hold the breath for a moment.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And now slightly open your
mouth and release all the air

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.950 align:middle line:84%
from your body in a
long, low deep sigh

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and relax, allowing your
lungs to naturally deflate

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.690 align:middle line:84%
as your body sinks into
gentle relaxation now.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.250 align:middle line:90%
And you can release any tension.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
Relax and let go as I
guide you through a journey

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.250 align:middle line:84%
of relaxation, a journey that
you will find very beneficial

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
for your overall well-being.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to start
this calming experience

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:84%
by first relaxing your
whole body mind system.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's true to say that the
simple act of relaxing the body

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.760 align:middle line:84%
and mind has a positive knock-on
effect because how you think

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
determines how you
feel and how you feel

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:90%
influences the world around you.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.330 align:middle line:84%
And how you choose
to think today

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.340 align:middle line:84%
affects your decisions
from here on in.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So to make my
assurances your reality,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.030 align:middle line:84%
let's begin by
focusing your attention

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.440 align:middle line:90%
at the very top of your head.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Tension often starts at
the scalp and the neck.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So mentally and physically
allow all the muscles

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
around the top of your
head to relax now,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.030 align:middle line:84%
letting all the
tension simply dissolve

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
as you start to tune in
to your body mind system.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Just let any tension you may
be holding to release now.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Allow your brain to relax,
the left and the right

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
lobes of the brain
just releasing.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Such a simple thought yet so
profound and so significant,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
just letting go completely.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Drifting further
and further down.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wanting anything,
nobody needing anything this

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.420 align:middle line:90%
is your time to relax.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Taking the relaxation
into the face

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:84%
now, allowing all of your
facial muscles to feel loose.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel your brow relaxing,
your forehead smoothing out,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.695 align:middle line:90%
the back of your eyes relaxing.

00:04:28.695 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Tiny muscles around your
eyes and eyelids down

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:84%
into your cheeks and
into your jaw muscles,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:90%
just releasing and letting go.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your
tongue to fall away

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.810 align:middle line:84%
from the roof of
your mouth and should

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
you find you need to swallow,
just do that now and drift

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
down and down, deeper and
deeper into blissful relaxation.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The more you physically
relax, the more

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:90%
you can mentally relax.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
mentally relax, you

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
can think much more clearly.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And when you think more clearly,
your life becomes clearer.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:84%
You make better decisions,
and you're much more

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.245 align:middle line:90%
in control of your days.

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.200 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
So noticing now how
your neck feels,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.850 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all little muscles,
letting go of the strain,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:90%
letting go of the tension.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Allow that tension that you
may be holding in your shoulder

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:90%
to go now.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Feel the shoulders
both of them sinking

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:90%
into the frame of your body.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Feel your neck lengthen
as you do this.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:84%
Feel or imagine all your
cares and worries just

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:84%
rolling off your shoulders now
as you take the relaxation down

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:84%
now into the tops of your
arms, letting any tension you

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.950 align:middle line:90%
may be holding just drain away.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.660 align:middle line:84%
And as your awareness flows
down through your upper arms

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:84%
into your elbows, all the
muscles in your forearms

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
relax right down to your wrists
and into your hands and way

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.325 align:middle line:84%
down into the very tips of
your fingers and thumbs.

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Your arms are feeling so heavy.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.177 align:middle line:90%
Your body's so comfortable.

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Nothing whatsoever
to do but just

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
relax and enjoy this feeling
of total release now.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:84%
As you let go of all the
tension in those muscles,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
you may experience them becoming
calm and gently releasing

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and just tune into the
feeling of simply letting go.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
As you become aware
of your breathing,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:50.600 align:middle line:84%
notice that you are now
breathing steadily and slowly,

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:90%
rhythmically.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And with each exhale,
you feel yourself

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
just relaxing even
more deeply, allowing

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
any tension in the chest area
now to simply drain away,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.575 align:middle line:84%
letting go completely
and totally.

00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
Bring awareness
into your stomach

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:23.020 align:middle line:84%
now and let all your
stomach muscles relax.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, I
want you to imagine

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
a ball of sunlight passing
down from the top of your head

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.400 align:middle line:84%
down through your face, your
throat, and into your stomach.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.490 align:middle line:84%
Visualize this healing
energy passing down

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.435 align:middle line:84%
through your throat and
chest and into your stomach.

00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So see and feel the sunlight
swirling and rotating.

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And as the light glows, it
warms and soothes and heals,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and you release and relax and
drift down and further down.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.320 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And in your imagination,
you send the sunlight out

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:24.830 align:middle line:84%
now to every nerve cell,
bone, muscle, fiber,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.350 align:middle line:90%
and system of the body.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
See it flowing through
the bloodstream

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:90%
and leave the light there.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It knows what to do.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:44.090 align:middle line:84%
As you take the relaxation
round into your back muscles

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and from your back muscles,
it relaxes those muscles

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:84%
either side of the spine,
releasing, relaxing,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.905 align:middle line:84%
and just letting go now,
deeper and deeper now.

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your
waist and the muscles

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
of your lower stomach and
down into the pelvic area, all

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the way down through
the large thigh muscles,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
down through your knees,
your shins, and your calves,

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
just allow all those areas of
the body to relax and let go.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
You're so relaxed, so
heavy, so comfortable.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And now tune into that
comfortable feeling

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
as you think on down to
your ankles into your feet,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.125 align:middle line:84%
right down to the very
tips of your toes.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
All the muscles of your body
now so beautifully relaxed

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
and you feel very heavy
and very comfortable.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.130 align:middle line:84%
And you're feeling centered and
relaxed and fully in control.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:24.960 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.060 align:middle line:84%
If there are any
areas of your body

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
that still feel
tight or tense, you

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
find that you can relax them
simply by giving yourself

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
permission to do so.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.970 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.195 align:middle line:84%
And you can now go even deeper
as I count down from 8 to 0.

00:11:43.195 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And with every number, you
feel yourself drifting further

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:90%
into blissful relaxation.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:01.727 align:middle line:90%
So 8, 7, 6.

00:12:01.727 --> 00:12:04.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:19.850 align:middle line:84%
5, deeper now, 4, 3, 2,
1 and 0, deeply relaxed ,

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.570 align:middle line:84%
letting go of all
the cars and worries,

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.690 align:middle line:84%
all the tension and pressure
and stresses and strains.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Let them all ease from your
body and ease from your mind

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:40.330 align:middle line:84%
and allow yourself to drift
down into a deeper more blissful

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.762 align:middle line:90%
state of creative relaxation.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Now that you're in a
deeply relaxed state,

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to talk
about better sleep.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Insomnia is the inability to
fall asleep and stay asleep.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not defined by the amount
of hours of sleep you get

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
or how long it takes
you to fall asleep.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:84%
Not being able to
sleep well can be

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.610 align:middle line:84%
caused by many factors including
stress, worry, anxiety,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
depression, perhaps
a medical condition

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
as well as many other factors,
maybe a noisy environment,

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
extreme temperatures,
jet lag, shift work,

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
going through the menopause,
misuse of alcohol,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:44.130 align:middle line:90%
caffeine, and other substances.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It can also take place
if you have a belief

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.230 align:middle line:84%
and tell yourself and others
that I'm a bad sleeper.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.970 align:middle line:84%
As effectively every
time you say this,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:04.430 align:middle line:84%
you're training your mind that
when it comes to bed time,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.400 align:middle line:84%
here is where you
don't sleep well.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.670 align:middle line:84%
So from now on in, today
you are taking back control.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
You start to believe more and
more each and every day, hour

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
by hour that you are now an
excellent sleeper, that you

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.880 align:middle line:84%
fall asleep easily and stay
asleep for seven to nine hours

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.100 align:middle line:84%
or until the time
you want to wake up.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.110 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And from now on, you set
yourself some good sleep

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:41.875 align:middle line:90%
hygiene rules.

00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You know that what
you eat and drink

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.865 align:middle line:84%
can have a big impact on
the quality of your sleep.

00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So you avoid fatty, fried, or
spicy foods before bedtime.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol is a stimulant, and
whilst initially calming

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and relaxing, it
will actually make it

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
harder for you to sleep
deeply and continuously.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So you cut down on the amount
of alcohol you drink each week.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You avoid drinking too
much fluid before bed,

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:84%
knowing that this
will only result

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
in you having to wake
up and go to the toilet.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, you know
that caffeine is a stimulant,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.750 align:middle line:84%
and it takes six hours, which
is half of the caffeine,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:90%
to be eliminated.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.510 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that you
stop drinking caffeine

00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:00.010 align:middle line:84%
after mid-afternoon, choosing
instead to drink more water

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and to hydrate and feel your
body in more healthy ways.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you start
to exercise more,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:84%
knowing that exercise
triggers an increase in body

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.600 align:middle line:90%
temperature.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And the post-exercise
drop in temperature

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:90%
helps to promote falling asleep.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:90%


00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, exercise
also reduces insomnia

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
by decreasing anxiety
and depressive symptoms.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:84%
So you start to increase your
exercise a little each day,

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
perhaps leaving the house
for longer periods of time

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.930 align:middle line:84%
to exercise or adding a few
more exercises to your existing

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:56.730 align:middle line:90%
routine.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you are
an excellent sleeper.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.680 align:middle line:84%
You fall asleep easily and stay
asleep for seven to nine hours

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:84%
or until the time
you want to wake up.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.405 align:middle line:84%
You start to create the right
sleep zone and better bedtime

00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:24.205 align:middle line:90%
ritual.

00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that your
bedroom is nice and dark,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and your body has a natural
clock, the circadian clock,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
which helps you
regulate your sleep.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And this clock is strongly
influenced by light

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of light and
darkness present in your room.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So you ensure you have
enough darkness now,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
putting up blackout
blinds if you need to,

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
and you ensure your
room temperature is

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.790 align:middle line:90%
neither too hot nor too cold.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Your bedding is just
how you like it.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.285 align:middle line:84%
You find a place where noise
is minimal to aid better sleep.

00:18:10.285 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.170 align:middle line:84%
You create a sleep zone that
is tranquil and comfortable,

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
making any of the necessary
changes that you need to.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:29.420 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
You no longer take
naps during the day

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:84%
if that's what you were
doing, knowing that this only

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
teaches your body that
sleep is for daytime and not

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:90%
for nighttime.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And you only go
to bed or to sleep

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:84%
when you're tired, allowing
yourself time to wind down.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.530 align:middle line:84%
You may choose to do
this by staying off

00:18:55.530 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
technology, by reading, or
simply doing some meditation

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
as this will get your mind
and body into a deep state

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.795 align:middle line:90%
of relaxation ready for sleep.

00:19:08.795 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you sleep
through the night,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.710 align:middle line:84%
you find that you feel more
energetic, more cheerful,

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and that you have much more
energy the following day.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
So beginning tonight or tomorrow
night or even in a few nights

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:40.380 align:middle line:84%
from now, you're able to go
to sleep without difficulty,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.385 align:middle line:84%
and you sleep well
throughout the night.

00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
You wake up feeling
good, feeling positive,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and ready for the
day's activities.

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.825 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you are
an excellent sleeper.

00:19:59.825 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.440 align:middle line:84%
You fall asleep easily, and
you stay asleep for seven

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to nine hours or until the
time you want to wake up.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to visualize
yourself at bedtime.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Notice that before you get into
bed, you're wearing a jacket

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and this jacket has many pockets
in it, and in each pocket,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
there's something
you're worrying about

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.820 align:middle line:84%
or that you're anxious
about, perhaps something

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:84%
you have to do, a
conversation that's

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.410 align:middle line:84%
on your mind, a fear or
negative thought that's

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:90%
weighing you down.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
You can feel how heavy that
jacket is, full of worries

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:90%
and things you need to do.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.470 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder you
don't sleep well

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
at night when you have all of
those things weighing you down.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
See yourself now
taking everything

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.490 align:middle line:84%
out of the pockets and
one by one putting them

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.600 align:middle line:90%
into a wooden box.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
Take your time now.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.745 align:middle line:84%
Make sure everything
is out of the pockets.

00:21:23.745 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
These are not something you
need to worry about now.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.610 align:middle line:84%
They're not something
you need to take to bed.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
You can pick those
up in the morning,

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:43.230 align:middle line:84%
but for now, it's time
to sleep, to rest.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
This is your time,
time just for you.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:84%
As everything is
out of your pockets,

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.090 align:middle line:84%
you gently lock the
wooden box and place it

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.010 align:middle line:90%
outside of your bedroom.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.800 align:middle line:84%
You can come back to that
box tomorrow if you want to.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.230 align:middle line:90%
The jacket feels so light now.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.210 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
carrying everything

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:84%
that has been weighing you
down and see yourself now

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.180 align:middle line:84%
slipping the jacket off as
it lightly falls to the floor

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.230 align:middle line:90%
and you leave it there.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
You no longer need it.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
You climb into bed and you
feel as light as a feather,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.200 align:middle line:84%
excited about getting
a good night's

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:90%
sleep as you know you will.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You are confident you will sleep
straight through the night,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
confident you'll sleep all the
way through to the time you

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.530 align:middle line:90%
want to wake up tomorrow.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:03.480 align:middle line:84%
See yourself fall asleep
and you sleep continuously

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:90%
until the morning.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.600 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you stir in
the night, you simply

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
drift straight back
to sleep again,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.690 align:middle line:84%
only waking until
the time you want to.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And the following
day, you notice

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.245 align:middle line:84%
how refreshed and happy and
full of energy you feel.

00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:90%


00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
From now on, you are
an excellent sleeper.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You fall asleep easily and stay
asleep for seven to nine hours

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
or until the time
you want to wake up.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.460 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.750 align:middle line:84%
and they'll become
more and more powerful

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm
going to count from 1 to 5

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.940 align:middle line:84%
to awaken you if
you wish to awaken.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of 5, you'll
be wide awake, fully refreshed,

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.270 align:middle line:90%
alert, and feeling fantastic.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you can continue
drifting, dozing into sleep,

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.265 align:middle line:90%
whatever suits you most.

00:24:14.265 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:90%
So 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:90%
