00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to take
in a very deep breath.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Slowly inhaling, filling
your lower and upper lungs.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And exhaling again, allowing
your lungs to deflate naturally

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.650 align:middle line:90%
and slowly.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And once you've done
that, I'd like you

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
once again to take a deep
breath, filling your lungs.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
allow that breath

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to slowly release as you
exhale, gently and powerfully.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
allow your breathing

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:84%
to return to normal, your
normal breathing pace.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Gentle breaths in and out
as you normally would.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, you're
aware of your eyes

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
of how comfortable they
feel, closed and relaxed,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.135 align:middle line:90%
totally at ease.

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now to
focus only on my words,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
and nothing else bothers
or concerns you at all.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.350 align:middle line:84%
This is your time, and no
one needs or wants anything

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Putting everything
else aside, I'm

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:84%
going to draw your attention
to various parts of your body.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I draw your attention
to that part of your body,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
you can allow each part
to relax and to release

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.980 align:middle line:84%
each muscle and nerve,
every part of it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.740 align:middle line:90%
as I refer to it in time.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's first focus
on your fingers,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and your hands, your
wrists, your forearms,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:90%
and your upper arms.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you think about
this part of your body,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to be aware of
any tension in those muscles

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:90%
and concentrate on that tension.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And now would you allow those
muscles to relax and release.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Every nerve, every fiber
in your hands, your wrists,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and fingers, arms, allow
that tension to flow away you

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
know, to drain down,
allowing the muscles to rest

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
and release,
lengthen and loosen.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Feel your arms become heavier
as they release completely.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.279 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
concentrate your attention

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
on your feet, your ankles,
your calves, your knees,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.585 align:middle line:84%
and the large muscles
of your thighs.

00:04:26.585 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Aware of any tension
in those muscles.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you concentrate
on them, you

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.520 align:middle line:84%
can relax every muscle, every
fiber in your legs and feet,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
allowing all of attention
to fade away now

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
as you drift deeper
into relaxation.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Muscles loosening and
lengthening as muscles

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:90%
relax and release now.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Legs feeling heavy as
you release completely.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Aware now of your chest,
your lower back muscles,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
your stomach muscles, your
upper back and upper chest.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Notice how all the muscles
in this part of your body

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.810 align:middle line:84%
are now becoming more
and more relaxed.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Loosening and lengthening
as each muscle releases

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and tension drains away now.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.280 align:middle line:90%


00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your shoulders to
sink into the frame of your body

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:90%
as you sink in to relaxation.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%


00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
All the little muscles in
your neck and scalp, aware

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.572 align:middle line:90%
of the tension here.

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And now you can
release that tension

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
as every muscle in
this part of your body

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.840 align:middle line:84%
becomes more and more relaxed
so that you can feel each

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
and every muscle in your
body now loose and limp,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and that comfortable
heaviness continues now.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And whilst you're
relaxing in this way,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to think about a
beautiful summer's day.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.930 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
imagine that you're

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.160 align:middle line:84%
floating on a cloud so
peaceful and so quiet.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
You feel safe and secure,
and you enjoy the serenity

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and peace as you
float and drift,

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:90%
feeling so comfortable and calm.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
You're completely at ease,
and every muscle and nerve

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.860 align:middle line:84%
in your entire
body is completely

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
relaxed as you go deeper and
deeper into relaxation now.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if you can
allow yourself to sink deeper

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.555 align:middle line:84%
into relaxation now as I
count from one down to three.

00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And as I reach the
number three, you

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
can allow yourself to have
drifted much, much deeper

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever been.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.140 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So, one, your entire body
completely released now.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Every muscle, every
nerve, and every fiber

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.250 align:middle line:90%
relaxed and at ease.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Your entire body, feeling
completely relaxed

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and comfortably heavy now.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And two, your head
feeling so heavy now.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
pleasant feeling,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and you feel safe,
and secure, and you're

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
enjoying this state
of deep relaxation

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
as you fall further and
further into relaxation now.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And you are now deeper than
you've ever been, so deeply

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
relaxed that every
word I utter to you

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.050 align:middle line:84%
will sink into your
subconscious mind

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
and create some powerful changes
as you sink deeper and deeper.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Mind alert, but body
totally relaxed now.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you're to stay
in a stressful state of mind

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
for long periods of time, this
will have some damaging effects

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to your mind and body, and
your mental health and physical

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:90%
health may begin to suffer.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So by listening to
this relaxation,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:84%
unwinding mind talk, you're
allowing your mind and body

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to get out of this state of
stress, the fight or flight

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.610 align:middle line:84%
response, and to reframe
your thinking patterns.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So you're stronger,
calmer, and much more

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.325 align:middle line:90%
energized for your day ahead.

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.110 align:middle line:84%
So remember, this is
your time to let go,

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
to help you begin to employ
the power of your subconscious

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.240 align:middle line:84%
mind, to allow you to
relieve some of the pressures

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:84%
and tensions that may have been
building up throughout the day.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
You are now consciously
making the choice

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:84%
to calm yourself down,
to slow your mind down.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Your breathing is
slow right now.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And in turn, that
will be helping

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to calm your nerves,
your responses.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself to
breathe in calmness

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.495 align:middle line:90%
and breathe out tension.

00:10:22.495 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Your day is over, and
you can allow the stress

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
to float away now.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to
unwind and totally relax.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you relax, I'd like
you to use your imagination

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:84%
to help create various images
and sounds to flow into you

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.985 align:middle line:84%
and to calm you
down even further.

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:59.260 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
At this moment,
it's as though you

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:90%
haven't a care in the world.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:90%
Nobody needs anything from you.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:90%
This is your time.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
nothing at all

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.860 align:middle line:84%
for you to do
except relax and let

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.630 align:middle line:84%
go and enjoy these wonderful
feelings being generated now.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like you now
to compare this feeling

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:31.980 align:middle line:84%
of complete relaxation to
the feelings and emotions

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
that you experienced today,
maybe feelings of being

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.410 align:middle line:84%
stressed out, and
anxious, or rushing,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:43.710 align:middle line:84%
not being able to catch your
breath as you were so busy.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you feel like
you couldn't keep up

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
because there was
too much to do,

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and frustration and
anxiety crept in.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And you've since found
it difficult to shake

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:90%
those feelings off.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Staying calm today may
have been very difficult.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps worries and stresses
appear to be piling up,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:84%
pent up, rather like
weights weighing heavily

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.730 align:middle line:84%
on your shoulders until the
weights upon your shoulders

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
became so heavy that you just
couldn't hold your posture

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:90%
as you normally do.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And even thinking
about those stresses

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
weighs you down, or
worrying about which

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.055 align:middle line:84%
one to deal with first just
made the whole situation worse.

00:12:41.055 --> 00:12:46.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you now to
use your imagination

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:84%
to remove those unwanted
weights from your shoulders

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
as you step outside
to a beautiful garden.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lovely warm day.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
The sun is shining, and the
sky is a perfect shade of blue.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Not a cloud in sight.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:90%


00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So imagine yourself now
in a beautiful setting.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.896 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you're walking
in a colorful garden

00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
or on a white, sandy beach.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And the temperature is
just how you like it.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And the sun is a
beautiful orange

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.102 align:middle line:84%
as it shines down on you
and your surroundings.

00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a cool refreshing
breeze across your face.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And each muscle
relaxes as you sink

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.510 align:middle line:84%
a little further in your sear
now as you relax even more.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.750 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Now the path ahead in your
mind stretches out for miles.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you feel
safe and secure,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
and you allow this
inner adventure

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
to bring you an incredible
sense of freedom.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.520 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you hear birds around you.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.170 align:middle line:90%
The sky, a clear blue.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And you hear the sounds of
the sea or a trickling lake.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:90%
You're safe and secure.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You're on your own with
no pressures on you,

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.770 align:middle line:90%
no demands being made on you.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
This is your time to
release and relax.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.055 align:middle line:84%
And you smile
easily to yourself.

00:14:44.055 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You take off your shoes and you
feel the ground beneath you.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.520 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you feel the
sand underfoot,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.265 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's freshly-cut
lush grass beneath your toes.

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
You take a few steps and
you enjoy the feeling

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.705 align:middle line:84%
of grounding as you walk
barefoot, enjoying the solitude

00:15:15.705 --> 00:15:16.505 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.710 align:middle line:90%
You may choose to take a seat.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Or if you prefer,
you may want to keep

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.960 align:middle line:84%
walking slowly, taking
in the beautiful setting

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.190 align:middle line:90%
and surroundings.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you dip your toes
into the crystal, clear water,

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
allowing the water
to gently wash away

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.850 align:middle line:84%
any of your remaining
stresses or tensions

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's entirely
your choice how you

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.755 align:middle line:90%
spend these wonderful moments.

00:15:55.755 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:84%
You look over to your right,
and there are two very

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.030 align:middle line:90%
strong trees.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you look carefully,
you see the hammock

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:90%
that's strung between them.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.200 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.600 align:middle line:84%
A few steps lead
up to the hammock,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:84%
so you walk over
and climb inside,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
making yourself even more
comfortable, even more relaxed

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and detached.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:35.330 align:middle line:90%


00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And ever so gently,
you're swaying from side

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.370 align:middle line:90%
to side, side to side.

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:90%
Such a comfortable feeling.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.710 align:middle line:84%
So perfect to be here right
now that you want to hold

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:90%
this feeling to you forever.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:17:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And you can, you really can
feel wonderful, and so relaxed,

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:90%
and comfortable.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You remember those weights
that were on your shoulders,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and you now see them lying
alongside the hammock

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.534 align:middle line:90%
next to you on the ground.

00:17:20.534 --> 00:17:24.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
You pick them up one at a
time and throw them far away

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:90%
from yourself.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.240 align:middle line:84%
They leave their
imprint on the ground,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
part of you anymore.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
They no longer define
you, and you're

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:90%
removing them one by one.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
This is your time,
and they have no right

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:84%
to bother you whilst you're
relaxed and comfortable.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Those stresses have no
right to make you feel

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:00.780 align:middle line:90%
stressed and anxious any more.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:84%
You now realize that
there are far better ways

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
of thinking and feeling, and
stress is not one of them.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:84%
You much prefer to feel calm,
relaxed, and comfortable

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.490 align:middle line:84%
as you lie in your
hammock gently

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.695 align:middle line:90%
swaying from side to side.

00:18:24.695 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, you immediately
feel so much calmer,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:84%
so much more relaxed, and
so much more comfortable.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.740 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, whenever you take the time
to visit this beautiful place

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
again, all those feelings of
safety, calm, and relaxation

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.430 align:middle line:90%
come flooding back.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And you'll reap the benefits
of this calm state of mind,

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
allowing your stresses
to simply melt away.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Your shoulders
feeling light as this

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:84%
is your time to release,
to relax, and to detach.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:22.250 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing to think about
other than yourself right now,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
nothing needing your
attention at all.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And you enjoy the
feeling of relaxation

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:84%
as it permeates every
fiber of your body

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:84%
as you go deeper and deeper
appreciating that you have now

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
allowed your hoping
to switch off

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.290 align:middle line:84%
or to reframe the
events of the day.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.640 align:middle line:84%
You're now so relaxed that
you're gaining control

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:90%
of your thinking patterns.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.830 align:middle line:84%
You're allowing your
mind to overcome

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
the stressful position you've
had and to unwind completely.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Your body will be gaining
the health benefits

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:14.770 align:middle line:84%
of this relaxed state
of mind, and your mind

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
is ready to face
the day tomorrow

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:84%
with a positive, refreshed,
calm, and confident outlook.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And these hypnotic
suggestions are now

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:84%
embedded in your
subconscious mind

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and will get more
and more powerful

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:90%
as the days and weeks go by.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And in a moment, I'm going
to count up from one to five

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.240 align:middle line:90%
to awaken you.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the count of
five, you'll be wide

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.940 align:middle line:84%
awake fully refreshed,
alert, and feeling fantastic,

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
bringing back with you all
the wonderful new feelings.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Coming back now with
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open when you're ready.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
