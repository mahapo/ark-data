[WHEEZE]

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, I'm Sophie from
the House of Wellbeing.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.740 align:middle line:10%
In our Aiding Better
Sleep, Guided Meditation

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.280 align:middle line:10%
and Hypnotherapy Series,
you'll find audios to help you

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:10%
and your children have a
much better night's sleep.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.680 align:middle line:10%
Not getting a good
night's sleep can

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:10%
be caused by so many
different factors,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.920 align:middle line:10%
whether it's anxiety, stress,
or just not being able to unwind

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.880 align:middle line:10%
after a long day.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:10%
So our collection
of audios will help

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.860 align:middle line:10%
you to really let go of
those anxieties, worries,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.740 align:middle line:10%
and concerns, meaning you can
fall asleep much more easily

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.800 align:middle line:10%
and stay asleep as well.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.250 align:middle line:10%
Our audio also includes some
healthy lifestyle changes,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:10%
creating the right zone in order
to aid a better night's sleep.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:84%
All of our audios are slightly
different to guided meditation

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
alone because we include
powerful therapeutic tools,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
including cognitive
behavioral therapy,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
neurolinguistic therapy,
visualization, and of course,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:90%
hypnotherapy.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's that combination of
powerful therapeutic tools,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
which makes them so hugely
effective at helping you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
to change your unwanted
beliefs, behaviors, old thinking

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.100 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:84%
When you listen to
our audios, you'll

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.630 align:middle line:84%
be put into a deep
state of relaxation,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's a state that's
really familiar to you.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
state of relaxation

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:84%
you go into just
as you fall asleep.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in that
state of relaxation,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:84%
your brain waves go into
the theta brain wave,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and that means that we're able
to bypass your conscious mind

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and go into your
subconscious mind.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
important for us

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that because
your subconscious mind is

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
where all your pattern, beliefs,
habits, and memories live.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So being able to access
your subconscious mind

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is important for us
to make those changes.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
It means that we're then able
to retrain, reframe, and rewire

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
your thinking in
order to eliminate

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
any of those unwanted
thoughts or behaviors.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we can replace
them with powerful long-lasting

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
suggestions.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
We recommend that you listen to
our audios at least four times.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.520 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's just
once that makes a change.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.312 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it takes a bit longer.

00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
It's different for everybody.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you listen to
them a good few times,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:84%
we're able to compound
those positive messages

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.950 align:middle line:90%
into your mind.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And you should soon see
changes about the way

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.500 align:middle line:84%
you think and feel
about an issue,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be able to
drift off into sleep

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
and stay asleep
much more easily.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
We also suggest that you
follow your instincts

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the audios
as little or as often

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
as you want to.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's different
for everybody.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.090 align:middle line:90%
So just see how you feel.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:10%
You can listen to our audios
at any time of day or night,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:10%
but we suggest you listen to
them when you're not too tired.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fall
into a deep, deep sleep,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.285 align:middle line:84%
then your subconscious
mind just isn't listening.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:58.083 align:middle line:84%
But if you fall into a
very light-like sleep

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and you get to the
end of an audio

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.542 align:middle line:84%
and you hear me when I
ask you to open your eyes,

00:03:01.542 --> 00:03:02.650 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely fine.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.540 align:middle line:10%
Your subconscious mind
has been listening,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.490 align:middle line:10%
and it will have taken in
all those positive messaging.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
We encourage you to
stay awake as much

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
as you can throughout
the audio with your eyes

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.817 align:middle line:84%
closed and a lovely,
deep, relaxed state.

00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:16.900 align:middle line:10%
So please make sure you
are listening to the audio

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:10%
when you're free from
any distractions,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.717 align:middle line:10%
and please don't listen to
them when you're actively

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:24.520 align:middle line:10%
doing anything like driving
or operating machinery.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
If there's an
emergency and you need

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.450 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and come
out of hypnosis,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.460 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely fine.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.638 align:middle line:90%
No problem at all.

00:03:30.638 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
Your conscious mind
will alert you and then

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:90%
easily come out of hypnosis.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just like waking up
from a nap or from a sleep.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So for now, please click
on any audio you feel

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:90%
is right for you.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Have a good look
through the series,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and choose one that you think is
just right just for your issue.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:84%
Find yourself a perfectly
comfortable position,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a bed or a chair,
and close your eyes to begin.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.000 align:middle line:90%
