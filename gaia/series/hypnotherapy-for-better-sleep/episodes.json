After a hectic or stressful, long hard day at home or at work, the first and most important thing you need to do is relax. If you find it hard to unwind then your stress will carry over to the next day and your mind will get into the routine of  being in this heightened state of stress which will ultimately start to affect your state of mind, decision making, sleep and health. This session will help you relieve some of the pressures and tensions that may have been building up throughout the day, so you can release any stress, slow your mind and wind down.

When a person is anxious, they are normally worried about something that might happen in the future.  So, anxiety is often problem solving and worrying about something that might not even happen. Anxiety is a response in your body to make you alert, prepared and ready to act for your benefit. But sometimes it doesn’t work for your benefit as your anxious thoughts can overwhelm you making you feel out of control and fearful.  In our session we will teach you some breathing exercises to help you remain calm and in control and replace those feelings of anxiety with feelings of calmness.
