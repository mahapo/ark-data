00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.990 align:middle line:84%

esoteric lineages propose that

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.155 align:middle line:84%
the human is a fractal

And a microcosmic and
a microcosmic scale.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
From this view, not only is our
planet seen as a single entity,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:84%
but so is our solar system
with the planets as chakras.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Our galaxy may be the next
fractal level out, itself

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:90%
a living being.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And this principle
repeats itself

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.730 align:middle line:84%
all the way out to the body of
the universe, which in the East

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.750 align:middle line:90%
they call Brahma.

actions are intricate parts

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.730 align:middle line:90%
within this universal being.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:84%

between all the things

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, this network
of interconnected structures

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.890 align:middle line:90%
talking to each other.

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
And so thinking of the brain
as isolated from the universe,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.410 align:middle line:90%
I believe is inaccurate.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like there is
transmission across the scales.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
And the result is what we call
consciousness, or awareness.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:10.020 align:middle line:84%
It's like the universe
thinking about itself,

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and discovering itself, a
feedback of information.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:24.180 align:middle line:84%
>>: Our Earth is also a
part of this vast hologram.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.140 align:middle line:84%
>>: The Gaia hypothesis is named
after the ancient Greek goddess

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth, Gaia, and was a
term coined by the scientist

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:90%
James Lovelock.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
It is the idea that the
Earth and all of its systems

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:84%
behave like a huge single
entity, like the human body,

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:84%
with self-regulating
feedback loops.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has
chakras like a human.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And the lungs would be the
rainforest, and the trees.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And the circulatory system
would be the rivers, the oceans,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
and lakes, and so on.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>: Like us, Earth
has a constant rhythm.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.760 align:middle line:10%
>>: The Schumann
resonance is like the--

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:10%
it's like the heartbeat
of Mother Earth.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.200 align:middle line:84%
The Earth has a magnetic
field around it,

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:84%
which is generated from
that molten iron core.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Those magnetic field lines
have a pulse to them.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:90%
They have a frequency to them.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:10%
And the Schumann resonance
is sort of like the base core

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:10%
frequency of the magnetic
field lines of the Earth,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:10%
which is around 7.8 Hertz.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.160 align:middle line:90%
So it's close to 8 Hertz.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>: The Schumann resonance is
a frequency bandwidth that goes

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:84%
from the crust of the
Earth to the ionosphere.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:10%
The 7.83 is a mean, because the
Schumann resonance depending

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:54.330 align:middle line:10%
upon lightning, sunspots, and
other activity will fluctuate.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
>>: Each of us has a harmonic
connection to this earthly

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.130 align:middle line:90%
sphere.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>>: And we, as
individuals, as humans,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:84%
interface with this
electromagnetic field that

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:middle line:84%
falls right within the brainwave
bandwidth of either a very low

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.980 align:middle line:84%
alpha, or a very high
theta, which is a very,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.200 align:middle line:84%
very nice state of
relaxation and meditation.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.640 align:middle line:84%
But if it goes higher, we
oftentimes may feel scrambled.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So there may be a relationship
between the Schumann resonance,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and how humans and our nervous
systems are affected by this.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>: Planet Earth progresses
through a spiritual evolution

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:90%
like all living beings.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:10%
>>: We are returning today to
the ancient understanding that

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.840 align:middle line:10%
the Earth is a living being.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:10%
It's alive.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
It is functioning
as an organic being

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:90%
going through a life process.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
It has a particular
vibrational basis

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of its vital life force, the
same way that the human energy

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
body has, but at a
much larger level.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:84%
>>: One of the fundamental keys
to understanding the ancient

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.280 align:middle line:84%
mind is that they had a
very highly attuned power

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.420 align:middle line:90%
of perception.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:10%
They were so in
tune with the Earth,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:10%
and we know the Earth is
essentially, a vibrating

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.080 align:middle line:10%
crystal, and that
it's responding

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:10%
to electromagnetic
radiation and frequencies

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:10%
coming from all over the
cosmos, including our sun.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>>: And so the vibratory
power of the Earth itself has

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.040 align:middle line:84%
the ability to create a pattern
of the Earth that places things

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:84%
in certain locations, both
as far as energetic currents

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.640 align:middle line:84%
It's so powerful it splits
the atoms into their component

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
parts, protons,
electrons, and neutrons

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.420 align:middle line:84%
in a fourth state
of matter called

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
plasma, charged electromagnetic
particles floating around

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.750 align:middle line:90%
in kind of a foggy soup.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's so powerful that
when it strikes a planet,

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
it blows its magnetic envelope,
and its ionosphere back

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.500 align:middle line:90%
like a comet tail.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And the leading edge of
that is called bow shock.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So we've got interaction

charged ions, charged

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%

in a constant harmonic dance.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%

to think of our solar system

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:90%
path every year.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.550 align:middle line:84%
From one year to
the other, we're

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.680 align:middle line:84%
literally millions of
kilometers away from where

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.950 align:middle line:90%
we were the year before.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
We're not in the same position
at all relative to the galaxy.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And the galaxy is moving
through space as well.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of
it as like vibrations,

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.190 align:middle line:84%
or strings ringing in the
structure of space making

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:90%

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%

have assigned certain planets

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:90%
to the chakras.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.440 align:middle line:84%
You might, for example, have
Saturn as the root chakra,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.160 align:middle line:90%
and Mars as the second chakra.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.930 align:middle line:84%
What you find also
is that it depends

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
on the tradition and the
perspective, or the angle

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.000 align:middle line:90%
that they're looking at it from.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.210 align:middle line:10%
The Kabbalistic approach
works with the tree of life,

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:10%
and how the planets are
corresponding to the different

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.970 align:middle line:10%
parts of the tree of life.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So the planets in a way,
are different notes.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And the various systems
that work with the chakras

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
have drawn from
those notes to create

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.568 align:middle line:84%
a certain musical
composition that allows

00:19:41.568 --> 00:19:42.860 align:middle line:90%

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Could this be connected
to the sound current,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing the
sound current in 2013

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
during a deep meditation, and
work with a sage from India.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
At the time, I didn't really
understand what it was.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Since then, my
experience and research

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.880 align:middle line:84%
has shown that it is
something significant,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:90%
and can be a great blessing.

what animates human beings,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:41.100 align:middle line:84%
it is that we are each unique

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to the same generative wave.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So the wave itself is
called the sound current

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:90%
in many esoteric teachings.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The sound current
is an emanation.

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an emanation directly
from the Godhead coming down,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
and I say down
particularly, because it

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:03.690 align:middle line:84%
is going in
wavelengths in quanta

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:08.370 align:middle line:84%

frequency to infinitely

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it is
a sign of a frequency

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.330 align:middle line:84%
increase on the planet, because
more and more people are also

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
reporting hearing the sound.

a simple musical instrument,

but the principles are the same.

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.530 align:middle line:84%
If you understand
these principles,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.590 align:middle line:84%
you really start to
tap in to understand

Will they be speaking English?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.120 align:middle line:90%
That's a possibility.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But more than likely,
as we saw, for example,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in the movie, Close
Encounters of the Third Kind,

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
they'll be communicating
with us through music.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Because music is math,
and music and math,

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:90%
that's the universal language.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we know that music
can encode knowledge,

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's incumbent upon
us now to understand

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the sacred science of sound.

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, that
likely will be the way

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.090 align:middle line:84%
that we will be communicating
with extraterrestrial beings.
