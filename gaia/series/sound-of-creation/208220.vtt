And from the three,
the 10,000 things."

So what that can be translated
as through the light

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:10%
and sound principles, the one
is the universal vibration,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.460 align:middle line:10%
the sound current, the godhead.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
But from a perceptual
standpoint,

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
you can just call it the sound
current, because we really

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.450 align:middle line:90%
can tune into that.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we relax
and move in resonance

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
with that kind of a vibe, we
are resonating with the one.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Sound, vibration, and
understanding of frequency can

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.930 align:middle line:84%
accelerate our awareness
and spiritual evolution,

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
because it will accelerate our
understanding of the material

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:28.860 align:middle line:84%
world and its interaction
with information.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And the technology
that will be developed

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:37.590 align:middle line:84%
from this understanding will
help humanity really evolve

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:84%
in its understanding of
itself and its relationship

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.260 align:middle line:90%
with the whole.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is the base
of spiritual evolution.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It is actually
understanding reality

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.400 align:middle line:84%
at a deeper level, which means
that we understand ourselves

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.890 align:middle line:90%
at a deeper level.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And that is the key to the
evolution of consciousness

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.810 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual awareness.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:08.750 align:middle line:90%

When the ears of the
student are ready to hear,

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.035 align:middle line:84%

In our next episode, Albert
Einstein claimed that we cannot

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.920 align:middle line:84%
solve our problems using the
same level of thinking that

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:90%
created them.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
How we can expand
our consciousness

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to get to the next level is up
