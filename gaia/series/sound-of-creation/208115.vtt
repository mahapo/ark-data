00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:10%

really important and
really fundamental,

that matter is not a thing.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
There's actually no thing in

The atom is made out

warned of the

what we perceive with our eyes.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:02.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Plato is considered the
father of Western philosophy.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:10%
And he believed that we
don't live in the real world,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:10%
that we live in the
shadow of the real world.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And he conceived an
allegory called the cave.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And in this allegory, he
described a group of prisoners

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:90%
who were shackled together.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Behind the prisoners was a
fire, and in between the fire

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:84%
and the prisoners
were other people who

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
were playing with puppets
that were casting shadows

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.240 align:middle line:90%
on the wall.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The prisoners all
believed that the shadows

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that they were seeing
represented the real world.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And then in his allegory, Plato
allowed one of the prisoners

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:90%
to escape.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
He went out into the real
world, and then returned

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and was actually blinded by
the light of the real world.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.575 align:middle line:84%
Seeing this, the
prisoners said, whoa,

00:13:53.575 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we want to stay in
the shadow world.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to be
blinded by the light.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.245 align:middle line:84%

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:84%
If we hear two tones
that are one hertz apart,

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
we can hear the difference as a
kind of pulsing binaural beat.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at two colors

we cannot discern the
difference visually.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.670 align:middle line:84%

Why would there be patterns?

After pondering
that for many years,

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.460 align:middle line:84%
he came up with a beautiful
description of the way

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
he viewed the world, which
involved something that he

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:90%
called the implicate order.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.410 align:middle line:84%

is that there is something there

that already exists.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It's pre-existing and it
needs to be activated.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.755 align:middle line:84%

in a phase of coherency
and incoherency.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.300 align:middle line:84%
But at some point, they're
going to come into coherency.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be in
sympathetic resonance.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.810 align:middle line:84%
There's something
implicit in that crystal

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:84%
that will respond
to that tuning fork.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the
implicate order means.

what he called
the law of threes,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
which essentially states that
for any phenomena to come

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
into existence, you have to have
what he described as a wholly

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
affirming, a wholly denying,
and then a wholly reconciling

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:00.880 align:middle line:90%
force.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And unless all three
forces are present,

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:08.050 align:middle line:84%
a phenomena is not going
to manifest in reality.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:10%

into the world.

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's a particular
power of one, power of two,

and three then is the
next in the sequence.

After we go from the unity to
the division into polarity,

polarity allows
movement to take place.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.190 align:middle line:84%
It allows attraction
and repulsion.

example of the law of three is

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:90%
your car.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Your car has three gears.

two opposite polarities could

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
simply be neutral, between
positive and negative.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It could also be
understood, though,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.730 align:middle line:84%
as the particular union of
the positive and negative,

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.067 align:middle line:84%

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.400 align:middle line:10%
I think he's actually accurate,
because the whole universe is

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.470 align:middle line:10%
vibrational.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, octaves
are a fundamental part

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:10%
a doubling of vibration
infinitely perhaps.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.300 align:middle line:84%

as that cell becomes fertilized

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:10%

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:10%
of a resonance, a frequency.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.670 align:middle line:10%
We could say a sound even.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:84%

to multiply itself,

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle line:90%
the one divides.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Through the cell
mitosis, it becomes two.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.730 align:middle line:84%
That 1 to 2 ratio
is the same that we

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:90%
could relate to the octave.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:56.010 align:middle line:84%
There's a harmonic ratio that's
starting to happen there.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.440 align:middle line:84%
We have the one to the
two, the two to the four,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:84%
the four to the eighth,
the eighth to the 16th,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:90%
the 16th to 32.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.540 align:middle line:90%
So it keeps doubling.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's following this
harmonic sequence.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.460 align:middle line:10%
You can also see a lot of
correlations between the cell

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.690 align:middle line:10%
division and the flower of life,
which is a sacred geometry.

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
So you have the one, and then
it divides and it becomes two.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.450 align:middle line:84%
And you have the
two overlapping.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:middle line:90%
You have the Vesica Pisces.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.440 align:middle line:90%
And then you have the four.

seven and eight,

for creation that exists
on a higher plane level.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%

down through multiple planes

The idea of Pythagorean
comma was then

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.480 align:middle line:84%
used to illustrate the
idea that everything

to manifest in
the physical world

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.485 align:middle line:84%
is just a little bit off its
actual perfect archetype.

00:24:24.485 --> 00:24:25.860 align:middle line:84%
But in the Egyptian
tradition, it

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.440 align:middle line:84%
was understood that
that slight imperfection

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:84%
is what made it completely
unique and beautiful.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And that if things
were 100% the pattern

of the true ideal
higher archetype,

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
it may simply disappear
from physical creation

>> Like in the creation of
a pearl or in the seeding

Benoit Mandelbrot was working

with the newly developing

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.830 align:middle line:10%
and especially
working with graphics.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They started plugging
equations into the computer,

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and out pop these graphics
that are called fractals.

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And what they noticed
is that no matter

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.550 align:middle line:84%
how many times they
repeated this equation

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:84%
that the fractal was a
mirror image at every level

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:90%
of magnification.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.890 align:middle line:10%
What's interesting about
this is that if they wanted

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.400 align:middle line:10%
to change any aspect
of the fractal,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.760 align:middle line:10%
they had to go back to
the original equation

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.980 align:middle line:10%
and change it.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.650 align:middle line:10%
Now when they were working
with the Mandelbrot set,

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:10%
they noticed that the Mandelbrot
set resembled a meditating

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:10%
Buddha.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.130 align:middle line:10%
So they went back in
and changed the equation

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:10%
and came up with what
they call the Buddhabrot.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Now this is really
extraordinary, because it tells

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.220 align:middle line:84%
us that if we're made
in the image of God,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.300 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps we are
fractals of our creator.

perfectly with Buddhism,

to our original and divine

In the Kabbalistic tradition,
it was described as a mirroring,

as above so below type of
relationship between these four

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:29.340 align:middle line:84%
trees that were tied to the
same sefirot at the center.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.830 align:middle line:84%
What we found was
that the center

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of each one of those trees at
the root that connected them

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:41.890 align:middle line:84%
was this first analytical
solution to gravity.

So that gravity is the hub.

It is the force that holds
all of the knowledge together,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:90%
right?

nothing would coalesce.

Nothing would become one thing.

It would all fly
apart, and nothing

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.660 align:middle line:84%
would be able to make
a star, make a galaxy,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:90%
make a planet, or even a proton.

has this aspect that all

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.150 align:middle line:10%

of creation are mirrored

into the physical
world in which we live.

And once we understand
that core pattern

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.850 align:middle line:84%
through the use of
sacred geometry,

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.450 align:middle line:84%
then we can see how both of
these are going to be connected

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and how our actions
on the physical world

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.280 align:middle line:84%
connect to and affect
the higher worlds,

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and how the higher
worlds create and sustain

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and effect us here
on this level.

Well, the answer
is, of course it is.

It is both.
