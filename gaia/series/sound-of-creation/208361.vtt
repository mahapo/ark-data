00:00:22.078 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We are all in an elaborate
universal dance at all times.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
But we may not always be aware
of the multitude of dance

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.330 align:middle line:84%
partners, or the
rhythm of the music.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:90%
It's constant poetry in motion.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:10%
Nature actually plays an
orchestra 24 hours a day,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.200 align:middle line:10%
seven days a week.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Not only do you have
the tides of the ocean,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:84%
we have the sound of trees
rustling in the wind.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
We recognize in most
parts of the world

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:84%
the four seasons, all the
different rain cycles, and all

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.810 align:middle line:90%
the different dry periods.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
We realize that
this planet itself

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
is just one harmonious entity,
and just like the human body,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
we are creating our blood cells
and regenerating ourselves

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:90%
on a consistent basis.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Earth is doing the
same exact thing.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:90%
As above so below.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:10%
>> So the rhythms in nature
are very clearly a reflection

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.630 align:middle line:10%
of cosmic cycles, and we can
see that just, for example,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.110 align:middle line:10%
with the day/night cycle.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.020 align:middle line:90%
The Earth rotating on its axis.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But we also have
greater cosmic cycles

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.050 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system rotating
around the galactic core

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:90%
of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you can go even further
and further and further out

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that there's cycles within
cycles within cycles,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
all of which are representing
some kind of a cosmic dance,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.345 align:middle line:90%
a cosmic harmony.

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:13.860 align:middle line:84%
>> From the macro to the micro,
everything is in a rhythmic

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.715 align:middle line:90%
flow of change.

00:02:14.715 --> 00:02:17.994 align:middle line:90%


00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:10%
>> From the electron moving
around the nucleus of an atom

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:10%
to planets and distant galaxies
moving around their suns,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:10%
they're all in a
state of vibration.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.620 align:middle line:10%
Whether or not we can hear that
vibration is another story.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
They are all in a
state of vibration.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
>> The dance persists at every
frequency scale of the spectrum

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:90%
within and around each of us.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a magnetic field that
emanates from this planet that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.760 align:middle line:84%
underlies all existence
of all living creatures.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.080 align:middle line:10%
Every blade of grass,
every dog, every cat,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.010 align:middle line:10%
every CEO of every corporation,
every leader of every nation

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:10%
is linked to these
magnetic fields

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.180 align:middle line:10%
and they have a
frequency, they have

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:10%
a vibration that influences
their ability to cooperate

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.722 align:middle line:10%
or their willingness
for competition.

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And this includes our body--

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
every organ, every bone, every
tissue, every part of our body

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:84%
is in a state of
vibration, it's in a state

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%
of normal healthy resonance.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.436 align:middle line:84%
And when we say we're healthy,
we say we're in sound health.

00:03:35.436 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>> To understand the mysteries
of the sound behind creation,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:84%
we need to first identify
the patterns which underlie

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.445 align:middle line:90%
the rhythms of form.

00:03:44.445 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature is based upon the
replication and duplication

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
of only a very few patterns
in rhythms and cycles.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the most foundational
is the phi or the phi ratio,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.480 align:middle line:84%
0.618 to the tip of
our finger to our hand,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and from the tip of
our hand to our wrist,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and our wrist to our elbow.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.435 align:middle line:84%
From where eyes are in
relationship to our nose

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%
and our mouth and our head.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Our entire bodies are
based upon this principle.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We can witness this principle
also called the Fibonacci

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:90%
sequence everywhere around us.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's reflected
holographically throughout

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.750 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
As trees grow, the
leaves or the branches

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%
will start to arrange themselves
according to the Fibonacci

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.280 align:middle line:90%
sequence.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.996 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Patterns are also repeated
in nature's union of opposites,

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
which are demonstrated by
the spirals that can move

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.350 align:middle line:84%
in opposite directions
in the growth of a plant.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
A plant or a tree is not a
singular or independent force.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing in creation
operates alone.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.760 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the principles
that ties everything together.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.084 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.084 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You can think of all the
human activity having one sound

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.665 align:middle line:90%
for the surface of our planet.

00:05:16.665 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:10%
Or all the birds
having one sound,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.700 align:middle line:10%
like all the birds chirping
right now around the planet.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful harmonic.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you can imagine
all the leaves in the trees

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.510 align:middle line:84%
all around the world
currently just oscillating

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.230 align:middle line:84%
in the space because of
the wind, making one sound.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.945 align:middle line:90%


00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:56.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Harmonia is a group mind
phenomenon that the Greeks

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.880 align:middle line:10%
described as being of one mind
together or a union of hearts.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.340 align:middle line:84%
In nature, we see schools
of fish, birds, ants, bees,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and many other species operating
as a kind of group mind.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.782 align:middle line:90%


00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can think of
different sets of information

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:84%
or different structure of nature
as being different frequency

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.326 align:middle line:84%
of this oscillation
of the space itself.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures have
known of this phenomenon

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.450 align:middle line:84%
for centuries but the knowledge
has recently been rediscovered.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:10%
>> In the early 1900s with
the availability of electronic

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:10%
instruments, Hans Jenny,
a Swiss medical doctor,

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:10%
began the field of cymatics.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And the name cymatics comes
from the Greek word cyma,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:56.735 align:middle line:90%
meaning wave.

00:06:56.735 --> 00:07:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
He would put sound vibrations
into different types

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:90%
of materials.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.490 align:middle line:84%
It might be water, it might
be paste of particular types,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
whatever sound he
fed into it, he

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.665 align:middle line:84%
would then see immediately form
up into this beautiful mandala

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:21.465 align:middle line:90%
pattern.

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, if you know anything
about nature forms and cymatics

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.690 align:middle line:10%
shows this beautifully, the
study of wave phenomenon,

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:10%
how sound will create geometric
patterns that are analogs

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:10%
to what you find in nature.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
It can be the Fibonacci
series replicated in the way

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.090 align:middle line:84%
that the daisy will
have its middle part

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
of its head or the sunflower.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Those tend to come out in a
specific sequence of arches

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.465 align:middle line:84%
that happen repeatedly,
creating a pattern.

00:07:58.465 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.330 align:middle line:10%
And then Lauterwasser,
or Alexander Lauterwasser

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:10%
who is 50 years later, he
was able to create analogs

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:10%
of nature forms that were so
precise that he could replicate

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:10%
the entire cell structure.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.000 align:middle line:10%
You could look at that and
say that is a tortoise shell,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:10%
but no, it wasn't.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:10%
It was lycopodium
powder configured

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:10%
with all the different aspects,
the polygon and the one part

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:31.015 align:middle line:10%
here and the parts
around the edge.

00:08:31.015 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.640 align:middle line:84%
The different fields were--
replicated that nature form

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:90%
perfectly.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Cymatics captures some of
these amazing patterns that we

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:10%
see in nature but the creation
of the human form is also

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.708 align:middle line:10%
a part of this
universal phenomenon.

00:08:58.708 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> The ancient
mystery tradition,

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
we say man or human is
the measure of all things,

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that we are the template,
that we are the blueprint,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that the tree of life,
for example, is our DNA.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:18.310 align:middle line:84%
>> We share 98% of our
DNA with other primates.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
I ask as a musician is

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.330 align:middle line:84%
if I share 98% of my
DNA with a chimpanzee,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
why have I never seen a
chimpanzee sing Led Zeppelin's

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.680 align:middle line:90%
Stairway to Heaven?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.940 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.040 align:middle line:90%
And we never will.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's because
something rare and sacred

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
and precious and
mysterious happened to us

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.350 align:middle line:84%
200,000 years ago when
anatomically modern humans

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:90%
emerged into this world.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
There were a series of
rare genetic mutations

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:84%
that'd never happened before and
they've never happened since.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:10%
We were given the
ability to connect

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:10%
our tongue and our mouth
and our jaw and our brain

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:07.700 align:middle line:10%
in a way that allows us through
our words to connect vibration

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.035 align:middle line:10%
to the unseen world.

00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:84%

And these harmonics are
responsible for the timbre

in the universe that is not

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.310 align:middle line:84%
on the electromagnetic
scale, and that's sound.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Sound is not electromagnetic.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.670 align:middle line:10%
It's separate.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:10%
It's the big yin
yang of the universe.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a pure energy
moving through a medium

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%
at a certain frequency.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And when the frequency ranges
between 20 and 20,000 Hertz,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
we happen to have developed this
little mechanism to interpret

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.730 align:middle line:90%
that and we call it sound.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you strip
the sound word away,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
it's part of a continuum
of vibrational frequencies

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:37.440 align:middle line:84%
that go infinitely large and
infinitely small, infinitely

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
low and infinitely rapid.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
And a little pie
wedge in the middle

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:90%
here, this tells us that sound.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And below that, this
tells us it's vibration.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.756 align:middle line:84%
But it keeps going that way,
and it keeps going that way.

00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Another interesting
correlation exists between

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:90%
chaos and coherence.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics demonstrates the
paradox between the two.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> First thing it's going to do
has come out of its static form

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to start
moving in a chaotic way.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So this chaotic form actually
has infinite potential

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:90%
as to what it can do.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:90%
It is not random.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Random is an artifact
of perception,

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.960 align:middle line:84%
and I'd say it's an
artifact of misperception,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:90%
not seeing the potential.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.620 align:middle line:84%
You just see the chaotic phase
as a thing in and of itself

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:36.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than a process
in transition.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So as you bring
the frequency up,

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
it will inspire that chaotic
mode, that mode in the moment

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:50.260 align:middle line:84%
to reconfigure itself but
it will reconfigure itself

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
at a higher order of
complexity and coherency.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I often think of how
in cymatic patterns when

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.010 align:middle line:84%
the frequency changes, the
patterns become more complex.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:10%
It is possible that
because we are entering

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:10%
a new astrological age,
the age of Aquarius,

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:10%
it represents a
different frequency

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:16.130 align:middle line:10%
pattern from the age we are
leaving, the age of Pisces.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
There is a period
of chaos or I feel

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:23.540 align:middle line:84%
it's similar to the static
between radio stations.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
Possibly we are in
that period now,

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:30.971 align:middle line:84%
between stations until the
new pattern reveals itself.

00:17:30.971 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's important to realize
that chaos eventually resolves

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
into coherence or reintegration
with the right frequency

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and timing.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:45.472 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, the same thing happens
within the natural world.

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you keep the organism
within its comfortable bounds

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.990 align:middle line:84%
of evolution and you
continually stimulate it,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:84%
you will find that you develop
more intricate neural pathways.

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
From a worm to a snake, to a
bird, to a mammal, to hominid,

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to an Einstein,
the neural pathways

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
are going to be getting more
and more intricate, more

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and more developed,
more and more complex.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>> While opposites
can be complementary,

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
similar properties like harmony
and balance may have important

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
and significant differences.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to make a distinction
between harmony and balance.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
I know so many
people are searching

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
for balance in their lives.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The balance between
work and career,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:42.510 align:middle line:84%
between family and
personal learning.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
really important is

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to understand that nature
does not work in balance.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.865 align:middle line:90%
Nature works in harmony.

00:18:53.865 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I live in a wilderness
area and there

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
is a harmony between the
population of rabbits

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:90%
and the population of coyotes.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
There never is a perfect balance
between the number of coyotes

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:17.480 align:middle line:84%
and the number of rabbits,
but there is always a harmony.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
As spring arrives and we see
a bumper crop of new bunnies,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden we
see more coyotes

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.880 align:middle line:84%
show up to check that
larger population.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's always the harmony,
but not so much what we

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.498 align:middle line:90%
would call a balance.

00:19:37.498 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
>> In what ways can we
enhance harmony and coherence

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.670 align:middle line:90%
collectively?

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> In the ancient traditions,
they understood that harmonics

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:50.828 align:middle line:84%
was creating resonance between
things so that that could be

00:19:50.828 --> 00:19:53.120 align:middle line:84%
not just on the physical
plane but connecting something

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:84%
on the physical plane to
something on a very specific

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.080 align:middle line:84%
level of the higher planes, and
that that creates a harmonic

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:90%
cascade between the planes.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Coherence means everything is
in sync, everything is aligned,

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
everything is working together,
which is similar effect

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:90%
as resonance.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Resonance will come in
and then train everything

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.060 align:middle line:84%
into that coherent
state, but it will also

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
amplify it because it hits
those higher harmonics.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.119 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:31.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And this was often
represented with the metaphor

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
in modern times of a piano, the
complete vibrational spectrum

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.910 align:middle line:90%
exists on every plane.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:10%
And by finding
that correct note,

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.940 align:middle line:10%
let's say a C note,
on the physical plane,

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.240 align:middle line:10%
you can make something of
that same vibratory quality

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.285 align:middle line:10%
vibrate on a higher plane.

00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
feed the energy

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.290 align:middle line:84%
from that object
in the higher plane

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:84%
into the physical to be
able to transform a person's

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.570 align:middle line:84%
consciousness,
person's energy field

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to change the energetic
fields around us.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.690 align:middle line:10%
>> And we have that coherent
state as an individual.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:84%
But then we also have multiple
people coming together,

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:90%
each achieving that coherence.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can have even more
of an amplified effect

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
upon the field, which then can
affect the physical outcomes

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.360 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.295 align:middle line:90%
It can affect matter.

00:21:30.295 --> 00:21:36.767 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the
things that we really

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.225 align:middle line:84%
want to see achieved
when we're talking

00:21:40.225 --> 00:21:44.635 align:middle line:84%
about a shift in
collective consciousness.

00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we unite collectively,
each of us can work

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
individually to bring ourselves
into a harmonic state.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
to do this, let's

00:21:55.390 --> 00:22:00.718 align:middle line:84%
explore how the body responds
to sound and frequency.

00:22:00.718 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It has been found that sound
can indeed affect our brain

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:84%
waves, which will affect
everything from our heartbeat,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:84%
our respiration, all sorts of
different portions of our brain

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.130 align:middle line:84%
can be lit up and
activated with sound.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
The sound is for the most
part going into our ear,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:84%
into our brain, affecting
our nervous system.

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.856 align:middle line:90%
This is called psychoacoustics.

00:22:27.856 --> 00:22:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:84%
A drumbeat, for example,
will go into our ear,

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.330 align:middle line:84%
affect your brain,
and affect our heart.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Any different music depending
upon the rhythm, the volume,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:90%
and the texture.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
>> All of it is according to
the law that we see operating

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.462 align:middle line:90%

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
It's all got to do with why
music and chords and relations

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
of vibration frequencies
seem to be pleasing to us

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.980 align:middle line:84%
or have a powerful
influence on us.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Some place in my
deep unconscious mind

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:middle line:84%
is responding, and
responding emotionally

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to a certain set
of frequencies that

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
happen to fall within a certain
mathematical relationship

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to each other like

00:23:36.578 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures and many
modern scientists and mystics

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
believe that the universe and

Earth, Gaia, are like expanded
scales of the human being with

all parts of the whole
interconnected symbiotically.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The Greeks felt that
the universe is one being,

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:90%
which they called a Zoan.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.830 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to the
concept from the East of all

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.320 align:middle line:84%
of the universe being
the body of Brahma.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Every day we learn more of
how vast the universe is

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.040 align:middle line:84%
and how galaxies form
super clusters, which

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
resemble very much the way
cells in the human body grouped

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So we may be observing the
universe from inside the body

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:90%
from our micro perspective.

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of the ancient cultures
around the Earth have talked

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.290 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that human beings
need to be in synchronicity

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.662 align:middle line:90%
with the planet Earth.

00:24:33.662 --> 00:24:35.620 align:middle line:84%
The Earth itself has a
human resonant frequency

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.710 align:middle line:84%
of about 8.1 Hertz
and the human brain

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.855 align:middle line:84%
has a very similar
frequency as well.

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:44.758 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.758 --> 00:24:48.400 align:middle line:84%
>> In Sanskrit, there is
a saying that frequency is

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
the mother of nature,
and rhythm is its father.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
The nature of life
is frequency as it

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:01.860 align:middle line:84%
moves through space such as
our heartbeat, our brainwaves,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
sleeping and waking, sunrise
and sunset, daily cycles,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and the larger cycles within a
lifetime, and over many lives.

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.395 align:middle line:84%

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And because we're born here
in the embryonic stage,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.010 align:middle line:84%
those frequencies and vibrations
are passing through us

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.480 align:middle line:84%
as a fetus and is having a
direct effect on our DNA,

on our consciousness.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming interwoven
