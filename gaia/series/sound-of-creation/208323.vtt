You walk into that and
you talk from the center

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:10%
and you can hear the resonance
reverberating off the walls

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
as if there's 50 people talking
all at once but all in harmony

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.550 align:middle line:10%

a gigantic box.

another box inside.

If you hit that stone
box with a mallet,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:10%

creates a resonant frequency

inside of the King's Chamber.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%

out-of-body experiences,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.470 align:middle line:84%
almost like an astral projection
if they lay inside that stone

Notably, the King's
Chamber which

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
is composed of red granite,
the ancient Egyptians

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
referred to red granite
as a fire stone.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:90%
It's mostly pure quartz.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And quartz crystal we know
holds frequency or vibration.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone was chanting
inside the chamber and then all

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
that reverberation was
coming back from the chamber,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
it would take them into an
altered state very quickly.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
These were used as initiation
chambers or healing chambers.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.405 align:middle line:90%
They were working with sound.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%

a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu.

Most people know it actually
from the Old Testament

and Moses using the staff.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
But it's very clear in all
of these ancient documents

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.630 align:middle line:84%
that he was trained in
the Egyptian temples,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%

to be able to move energy.

Everywhere where
they intertwine,

in the human body, which
according to the ancient Hindus

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:10%

different forms of staffs,

You can move your
hand along the staff

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%

of the staff toward the top.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And like you were
tuning a musical string,

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:84%
you could find a particular
resonant frequency point

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.665 align:middle line:84%
to build a project or to
absorb energy from the staff.

Now, another thing that we find
that is irrevocably tied to 432

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:84%
is that if we inscribe the
Great Pyramid within a sphere,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
it would become a sphere that
would be a replica at scale

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:90%
of 1 to 43,200.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%

that that's going

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.575 align:middle line:90%

from this standpoint
because we can even

express one-third of 60 as 20.

The Sumerians, I
believe, figured this

out where they
learned how to count

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
based on the number of
knuckles and their fingers.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:26.700 align:middle line:84%

6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.240 align:middle line:84%
And then they would use this
hand to count each group of 12.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.360 align:middle line:90%
So 12, 24, 36, 48, 60.

to apply to the energy field
