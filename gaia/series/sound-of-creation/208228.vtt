00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:10%
probably through
the force of sound.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.920 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we feel when the
pineal gland is activated

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.790 align:middle line:84%
or when we are entering
expanded states?

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We're just listening
and letting our body come

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
into coherence with that which
we are listening to safely.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:10%
We're not activating
what's called the amygdala

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:10%
in the brain, which means fear.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:10%
We now are safe and
we're vibrating.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.987 align:middle line:90%
And so we're not judging.

00:18:53.987 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
We're not in that state of mind.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We've completely transcended
or default mode network.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:84%
We would say we're
inside the sound.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:84%
If you have pictures
of Emoto, it

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.090 align:middle line:90%
looked like that in your head.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:84%
All these ripples are moving
through the inner ocean

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:90%
inside of you.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland itself
is like a tuning fork that

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.010 align:middle line:90%
just shakes like this.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And it basically
causes a spiral effect.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what Raymond Moody, when
he talks about death and dying.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:31.170 align:middle line:84%
People move through this
corridor drawn by sound.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we're now
able to withstand

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.810 align:middle line:84%
in octaves to different states
and different perceptions

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%

walk this path in life,

and the path is fated
to land us at a fork.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we arrive at this
fork, I have to make a decision.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Which fork am I going to make?

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And this one over
here is the tugging

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:07.967 align:middle line:90%
of my heart and my soul.

00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It's telling, go that way.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Go that way.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It's going to make
the best use of you.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:90%
Universe says yes to you.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:90%
This way is the path of safety.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Adults in my life
are saying, grow up.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Get a job.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Work for safety.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Lay away some money on the
side for your retirement.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.980 align:middle line:90%
Most of us do that.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Others take the
road less traveled.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And enter into the universal
hero's journey to find

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of my soul.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I come to that
fork, that's this right fork.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I can't see how it's going
to work, but it pulls me.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.760 align:middle line:84%

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It becomes this flow.

It becomes this synchronized,
serendipitous adventure

00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:84%

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%

for a person saying I'm in
tune or an athlete saying

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the zone is
neural coherence,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:84%
because our neuronal system,
neurons, are vibrating.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, when
we have coherence,

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:84%
they are vibrating
together in unison.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:84%
In a state of neural
coherence, we're safe.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.170 align:middle line:90%
We're calm inside.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to perceive
our world coherently.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.980 align:middle line:84%
We begin to make
choices that are better.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Neural coherence
is a way of saying,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
we are now in the
zone in our life.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We are perceiving and
getting accurate information

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and feedback from
our external reality,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and we are now in a position
to successfully adapt to it.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So we need neural coherence
to get accurate feedback.

we can always realign ourselves
with the divine creation.

have this ability to simulate,
to visualize all potentials.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:84%
We get to imagine
and question, what

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:84%
would happen if I did this, and
what would this relationship

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.170 align:middle line:84%
look like, and what if
I built this device?

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:41.630 align:middle line:90%
We imagine these things.

perspective for what

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.550 align:middle line:84%
our ancestors have told
us for a long time.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:84%
If we think of it and we
love it, or we think of it

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.550 align:middle line:84%
and we fear it,
those are the things

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
that we bring into our

>> There is the work of a
wonderful medical doctor,

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:10%
an otolaryngologist by the name
of Alfred Tomatis who wrote,

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:10%
among other things, a book
called "The Conscious Ear."

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.341 align:middle line:84%
He delineated
listening from hearing.

00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Hearing was a passive activity.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Listening was an
active activity.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you listen, you're
able to actually access

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
different levels of
consciousness, working

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:90%
with the emotional body.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.630 align:middle line:84%
The phenomena of listening
can be truly extraordinary,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
whether you simply just sit
there and take a moment,

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:84%
quiet yourself,
and begin to listen

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
to the sounds that are around
you and the sounds within you.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And it might be hearing
your heartbeat or breathing.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that
the word listen

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and the word silent
are anagrams,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.280 align:middle line:90%
composed of the same letters?

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.790 align:middle line:84%
I like to say, be
silent and listen.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And as you enhance that, you are
therefore altering the very way

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.590 align:middle line:90%
that you perceive reality.

So from the very
beginning when we're told,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.010 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning
was the word, we

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:84%

collectively.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning is

wash the potatoes.
