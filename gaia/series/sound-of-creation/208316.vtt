00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The structures are massive,
ancient, and glorious.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.890 align:middle line:84%
They have inspired
humanity for centuries.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.510 align:middle line:84%
Some have been labeled
the wonders of the world,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:84%
but their origins are
mysterious and controversial.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:10%
>> All around the world, from
Gobekli Tepe in southeastern

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.890 align:middle line:10%
Turkey, to the high
Andes in Bolivia,

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:10%
with the Gate of the
Sun, pyramids of Egypt,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:10%
we find these megalithic
constructions that nobody knows

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:10%
how they are constructed.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:10%
>> If there was just one
anomaly or even three,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:10%
that would be one thing.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.110 align:middle line:10%
But there's thousands
all around the world.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.320 align:middle line:84%
From pyramids in Egypt,
Guatemala, Mexico, some of them

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
dating to the time of
hunters and gatherers.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.590 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in
Turkey, temples have

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
been found that are built
out of megalithic rocks,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
12,000 to 13,000 years old.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it possible that
supposedly primitive peoples,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
hunter-gatherers--

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.670 align:middle line:84%
they don't have their wheel,
they don't have an organized

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
culture, supposedly, but somehow
they're able to build these

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.760 align:middle line:84%
constructions out
of five, 10, 20,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
1,000-ton blocks of stone that
sometimes they haul for miles

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.700 align:middle line:84%
before they're put into
their ultimate location.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The blocks that they were
using to build these temples

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:10%
were so massive, that they
couldn't have been dragged

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:10%
along by manual human labor,
and then put into exact perfect

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:10%
position.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And then, the arrangement
of one block to another

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
was fit so tightly
and so perfectly.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>> We know that
in ancient times,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.640 align:middle line:10%
many people built
beautiful buildings,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:10%
beautiful cathedrals, without
knowing mathematics and modern

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:10%
principles.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of these remarkable
monuments are not anything we

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
could reproduce today with all
of our technology currently.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:84%
>> How were these giant
stone structures created,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and by whom?

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:10%
>> People who were
transforming to higher states

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness, and
in these higher states,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:10%
they got understanding what
should be done and how they can

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:10%
do it.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it was using sound
technology to create

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
an anti-gravity field or some
kind of magnetic resonance.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
There was a way that they
had an advanced technology

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
to build these temples
and these megaliths.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It might have been sound or
frequency in combination with

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.540 align:middle line:84%
technology, that a certain
frequency would produce

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.970 align:middle line:90%
gravitational effects.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no other real truly
scientific explanation for how

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they accomplished what
they accomplished.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The ultimate answer
has to involve sound.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
They must have been able
somehow to put themselves

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
into some kind of sympathetic
resonance with these materials.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I believe it makes
sense that many thousands

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.460 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, Earth was in a
different vibrational state

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:90%
than it is today.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The possibilities are as
intriguing as the buildings

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.230 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.600 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's
not where we should

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.980 align:middle line:90%
start unraveling the mystery.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> We tend today to always look
at the actual constructions

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:84%
on the site rather than starting
by looking at the land itself.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.310 align:middle line:84%
In all of these cases in
the ancient world, and only

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.160 align:middle line:84%
in very recent times,
was the understanding

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.110 align:middle line:84%
that you always look for the
sacred power spots first.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Many megalithic sites,
including pyramids and stone

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.210 align:middle line:10%
circles and sacred
sites around the world,

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.140 align:middle line:10%
are deliberately located on
Earth energy lines or at nodal

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.795 align:middle line:10%
points of this global
Earth frequency grid.

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:84%
>> These are the points on the
Earth that have a particular

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
power to them, that have a
particular vibrational quality.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And that vibrational quality
is actually the energy quality

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
of the original unified field,
the singularity state, the one

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
that everything came out of.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>> They seem to be intended for
transmuting or channeling that

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:84%
energy for healing or
ceremonial purposes.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> These sacred power spots
on Earth function similar

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
to chakras or acupuncture
points in the human body.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And they will have
the ability to help

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.767 align:middle line:84%
to harmonize energetic
fields and consciousness

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
through the energy of that site.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.588 align:middle line:84%
>> These power spots have unique
alignments across the globe.

00:05:51.588 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Everywhere you
look on the planet,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.297 align:middle line:10%
you find these magnetic
nodes which have these power

00:05:55.297 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:10%
locations coming up
out of the Earth,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:10%
whipping around the planet.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But these locations are where
a lot of the ancient temples

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:90%
and structures are built.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.270 align:middle line:10%
>> You can start to see that
they were not just placed

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:10%
randomly around the world, but
they seem to be placed in very

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:10%
specific relationship to each
other and with very specific

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:10%
mathematical angles
to each other.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Teotihuacan being
a great example,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.570 align:middle line:84%
where you have the Moon Pyramid,
the Sun Pyramid, and what

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.090 align:middle line:84%
is called the Way
of the Dead, which

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of as more
the way of initiation.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Biggest power spot becomes
where the palace of the ruler

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.600 align:middle line:90%
will be formed.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Then other power
spots will be where

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.220 align:middle line:84%
they place all the different
temples and the places

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:90%
to connect directly to spirit.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
They'll also take
the power spots

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
and they'll create
a pathway from it,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.290 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the pathway,
which would later

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.910 align:middle line:84%
become the road systems, is
going to be a type of channel.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.190 align:middle line:10%
And it will take the
power spot energy

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.420 align:middle line:10%
and run it along the
pathway as if it was water

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.730 align:middle line:10%
running along a water channel.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Underneath the
Pyramid of the Sun,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.910 align:middle line:10%
and also Great Pyramid at Giza,
they have the ability to absorb

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.800 align:middle line:10%
something called physio-static
electricity from running water.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.120 align:middle line:84%
As the water moves under the
magnetized granite at the base,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
it creates physio-static
electricity,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:84%
which these ions rush up into
the pyramid itself, and there,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
extend into specific chambers.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
Once it hits these
different chambers,

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.700 align:middle line:84%
the hypothesis is that in some
way, it creates electric power.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And in some way, it comes out
of the apex of these pyramids.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Another way to look at this
energy current is from a sonic

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:90%
or musical perspective.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:10%
>> For instance, in Teotihuacan,
this way of the dead had

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.140 align:middle line:10%
waterways that flowed from
one level to the other

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:10%
to the other, to the other,
showing very specific

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.210 align:middle line:10%
relationship between each
of these cascades of water

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:10%
to produce very specific musical
harmonics across the whole

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:10%
complex.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
>> At Chichen Itza, you see
something really amazing.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:84%
You have the pyramid
of Kulkulcan,

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.080 align:middle line:84%
which is a great
temple, and then

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
you also have the
Temple of the Warriors,

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:90%
and you have the observatory.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.677 align:middle line:84%
These structures were built long
before the Mayans even arrived.

00:08:41.677 --> 00:08:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The Mayans learned about
some of the secrets

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.093 align:middle line:84%
of the sounds and
frequencies that are

00:08:45.093 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:90%
emanating from that location.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Depending on where
you're standing,

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.390 align:middle line:90%
you can hear different sounds.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
If you clap or make
a certain noise,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
you can get different
echoes back.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these are nodal points
on a web or a matrix of energy

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.610 align:middle line:84%
across the Earth's surface
that, in the ancient traditions

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
of the West, was
referred to as the net.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And the people in
ancient Egypt that

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.440 align:middle line:84%
knew how to work with
this vibrational matrix

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
were literally called, in the
documents from ancient Egypt,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.720 align:middle line:90%
the masters of the net.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be that the masters
of the net were leaving us

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual and technological
blueprint for all ages?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at the
Teotihuacan pyramid complex

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:10%
in Mexico, right by Mexico City,
you discover something amazing.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:84%
First of all, they have
the same exact alignment

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
of the three pyramids at
Giza by the Great Pyramid.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:10%
The second thing is
that the perimeter

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:10%
of the sun in
Teotihuacan is exactly

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:10%
50% of the height of the
Great Pyramid located

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:10%
at Giza in Egypt.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:10%
Also what's amazing is, the
base of the Pyramid of the Sun

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:10%
is exactly the same
exact size as the base

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.317 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid at Giza.

00:10:00.317 --> 00:10:01.400 align:middle line:90%
So what does this tell us?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that it's
the same architect.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
The same architect that built
the Great Pyramid complex

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
at Giza is the same
exact architect

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
that designed the
Teotihuacan pyramid complex.

and where do we find them
in the ancient texts?

have the story--

successor of Moses,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:10%
who was trained in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.260 align:middle line:10%
has an extraordinary way of
bringing down these walls.

The Lord tells him to
have his warriors walk

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.050 align:middle line:84%
around the perimeter
of the walls of Jericho

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.690 align:middle line:90%
once a day for six days.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
They're following
seven priests who

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:84%
have ram's horns in their
hands, and they're also carrying

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And he tells them that
on the seventh day,

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.980 align:middle line:84%
they are all to walk around the
walls of Jericho seven times

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
while the priests
simultaneously blow

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
a long blast with their horns.

[YELLING]

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:90%
And the walls came down.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>> What that tells us is that
they're walking in unison,

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:10%
they're shouting in unison,
and there must have been

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:10%
a consciousness
component as well.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And with that sound, they're
able then to bring down

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.560 align:middle line:90%
the walls of Jericho.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.830 align:middle line:10%

had a way to reach sympathetic

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:10%
resonance with each other, and
with the given material such

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:10%
as stone, and its
particular density,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:10%
which is also a frequency.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> If they knew the correct
resonant frequency of whatever

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:84%
made up the walls, they could
have conceptually used sound

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.645 align:middle line:90%
in that manner.

00:12:00.645 --> 00:12:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The Bible makes clear that it
wasn't the Ark of the Covenant

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.070 align:middle line:90%
that brought down those walls.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
It was the power of sound
in the unified consciousness

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the soldiers and the priests.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Conspiracy can
mean a secret plan,

But the actual breakdown of
the word in Latin, conspire,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:90%
means to breathe together.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So any time people do singing
groups together, chanting

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:32.460 align:middle line:84%
mantras or praying together,
visualizing together, dancing

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.760 align:middle line:84%
together, this is a
kind of conspiracy.

remain a mystery for the ages,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
but perhaps it's possible to
decode the messages they left

00:12:53.170 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
behind, including the principle
of sympathetic resonance.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:10%

principle that has to do with

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.650 align:middle line:10%
how things self-organize

come together,

the same frequency--

chant or a mantra,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
those frequencies can
resonate together in a way

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%

>> Ultimately, understanding
these principles of resonance

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:84%
and sympathetic resonance can
allow us to actually understand

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
how to build very
advanced-technology

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:55.560 align:middle line:84%
instruments, musical instruments
you can think of, that are

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
resonating in the proper
configuration so that they

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:07.260 align:middle line:84%
produce a sympathetic resonance
frequency to this fundamental

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:11.210 align:middle line:84%
energetic field
of space and time.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you
have that, it's

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
like you've logged on to
the structure of space

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:90%
and the universal internet.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It's believed that the
ancient cultures used several

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
resonant type technologies, one
of them being the djed pillar

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt, which is essentially
a column with four cross-bars.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:10%
>> The pyramids were
sound structures,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:10%
or the purpose of the pyramids
was to vibrate at certain

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:10%
frequencies, to bathe the entire
Egyptian civilization in these

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.750 align:middle line:10%
frequencies.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.500 align:middle line:84%
How were those sounds
then transmitted?

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that that's
what the djed pillar was for.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.150 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of like a
transmitter of the vibration

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:90%
coming from the pyramid.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians had a really
interesting conception

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
that if you saw an
image of a djed pillar,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:84%
it could perform the
function of the djed pillar.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the image
of the djed pillar

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
actually performed
that function as well.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And this djed ironically
looks just like a Tesla coil.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the electric
poles in your neighborhood,

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
you'll find little
djeds attached

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to the main box that's connected
adjunct to the telephone

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and the electric poles.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting
is, Tesla found a way

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
to utilize this in one
of the experiments,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and he actually turned
it into an oscillator.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look
into ancient text,

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
you find that the
elite of the elite gods

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.260 align:middle line:84%
had something called
a djed pillar ankh.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The djed would be actually
embedded into the actual ankh,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
and the oscillation would
match the exact frequency

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
of the owner.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.140 align:middle line:90%
Now, why was this important?

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, they had stargates
in those times,

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:90%
according to their text.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.800 align:middle line:84%
They had gates where they
would walk from one planet

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The gate itself was key-coded to
the specific frequency of only

00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.367 align:middle line:90%
the highest-level people.

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't have the
djed pillar ankh in your hand

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.380 align:middle line:84%
that resonated
your frequency that

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.770 align:middle line:84%
was programmed into the gate,
you couldn't walk through it.

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to the
djed, they had the Uas,

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
which is a rod that has a base
that looks just like a tuning

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:90%
fork.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm of the opinion that if
something looks like something,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
then it is that.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite possible that the
Egyptians would utilize the Uas

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.810 align:middle line:84%
pillar as a tuning fork
that would literally

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
help them to continue to
resonate at that higher

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
frequency emanating
from the pyramid.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Also in Egypt, we see
the origins of a symbol

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
called the caduceus,
which is a central rod

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
with entwined serpents that's
topped by a circle or a ring.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
that rod literally

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
is a magic wand that produces
a ring or a vibration.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
In the classic example, you'll
see the Egyptian god Thoth

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
holding the caduceus
wand while he's also

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.859 align:middle line:84%
holding the key of
life and resurrecting

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Seti from the dead.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.050 align:middle line:84%
So it appears as if the
caduceus and the key of life

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.230 align:middle line:90%
do in fact work together.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in
the Greek tradition,

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Hermes carried
the caduceus wand,

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and this was his
tool or instrument

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
that he used to open portals
or gateways between realms.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the famous examples
of ancient machining

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
is, at the Temple
of Seti at Abydos,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a temple
called the Osirion

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that is 40 feet
beneath the ground

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:90%
level of the Temple of Seti.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
It's composed of Cyclopean red
granite blocks, mostly composed

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:84%
of quartz, which
means it's going

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
to have a resonance or
a vibratory capacity.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And etched on two of
those enormous pillars

00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle line:90%
is a flower of life.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knows how it
got there or when,

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:84%
but it's another
clue that this is

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.300 align:middle line:84%
the path we need
to follow in order

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.690 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the Osirion
and other temples that

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
are like that were
actually constructed.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> The shape of the temples also
may play into this resonance

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.160 align:middle line:90%
theory.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:10%
>> We understand in biogeometry
that the very well-known

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:10%
pyramid shape that they used
in Egypt to build on the sacred

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:10%
power spots, to connect the
power spots in the heavens with

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.910 align:middle line:10%
the power spots in the earth,
that that shape itself is one

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.780 align:middle line:10%
that resonates with what in the
West today we call the astral

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.410 align:middle line:10%
plane.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And so by putting
this particular shape

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.340 align:middle line:84%
on that location
on the land, you

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
are creating a connection
between the Earth

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.780 align:middle line:84%
and the first true spiritual
plane of experience,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.450 align:middle line:84%
so that people could then,
in the pyramid shape,

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:23.030 align:middle line:84%
have an experience
of the astral plane

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.690 align:middle line:90%
and begin an astral journey.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The construction was
shrouded in sacred geometry

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and sophisticated mathematics.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The King's Chamber in the
Great Pyramid was set at a very

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.350 align:middle line:84%
specific angle of
about 6 degrees,

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.770 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes off of center.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.610 align:middle line:84%
They understood the powers
of all these angles inside

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
of the shape geometry
of the pyramid.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1859, John Taylor was the
one who first discovered that

00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:00.030 align:middle line:10%
the pyramid has encoded
within it the formula for pi.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:84%
He discovered that if
you divide the perimeter

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
of the Great Pyramid by
its height, you get 2 pi.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle line:84%
This is at least 2,000
years before pi is actually

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:90%
discovered.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:18.950 align:middle line:84%
The Great Pyramid encodes
the speed of light.

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It encodes the
circumference of the Earth.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.125 align:middle line:84%
It encodes the distance
between the Earth and the moon.

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Archeologists are now
discovering evidence that this

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
expertise was found
across the globe.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Now, we have lidar technology
that allows us to see under

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:10%
the foliage in southern
Mexico and Guatemala

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:10%
and so on, and we're discovering
thousands and thousands

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.030 align:middle line:10%
of pyramids--

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:58.630 align:middle line:10%
some very large, that we
thought were mountains.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing that there
is a very specific

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.560 align:middle line:84%
intended relationship between
temples all around the world.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Were the humans during the
era of building pyramids more

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated than
civilizations today?

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:10%
Did they have outside help
or other gifts unknown to us?

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.370 align:middle line:10%
>> In the construction of
those megalithic temples,

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:10%
we always find a legend
about sound as a method

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:32.650 align:middle line:10%
of levitation, or the power
of sound and its impact

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:35.230 align:middle line:10%
on the human body.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I believe it makes
sense that many thousands

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, Earth was in a
different vibrational state

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:90%
than it is today.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence,
human beings

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
had access to levels of
mind, methods of perception,

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that we're not even
aware of today.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:10%
>> The Ancient Egyptians
understood that they could use

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:10%
sound in a much more advanced
way than we know today,

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:10%
to be able to move objects,
or to reduce their weight

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.200 align:middle line:10%
and the gravitational effect,
making these types of amazing

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.530 align:middle line:10%
constructions much easier to do.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Even into modern times, there
has been the preservation,

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in some closed groups,
some family groups,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge of
how to use particularly

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.840 align:middle line:84%
sound to be able to do a
type of stone levitation.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.200 align:middle line:84%
It cannot just be done by the
average person off the street.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:84%
They have to have had
done work to transform

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.410 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness state,
which then transformed

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.670 align:middle line:84%
their energetic body, to be able
to merge with these vibrations

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:90%
and direct them properly.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The big question is, where
did this technology come from?

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
When a person is in front of
the Great Pyramid or even in it,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:84%
you get a tremendous
inner sense or a knowing

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.830 align:middle line:90%
that this is non-human.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I don't mean to go
to extraterrestrials or aliens

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:07.840 align:middle line:84%
and flying saucers,
because they didn't

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.340 align:middle line:84%
need flying saucers in order
to move around the cosmos.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.700 align:middle line:84%
What the pyramid texts say
is that ordinary humans

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.330 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to be
transfigured into a higher

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
being of light, and then be
projected through the pyramid

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.940 align:middle line:84%
portal to other
regions of spacetime.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, beings from
other regions of spacetime

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.075 align:middle line:84%
could come to Earth
through the pyramid.

00:23:34.075 --> 00:23:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there human beings
capable of such expertise

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:90%
in modern times?

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Surprisingly, examples do exist.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:10%
>> An amazing modern-day
technological feat is right

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:10%
here in America.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's called the Coral Castle,
located in Coral Gables, Miami,

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
Florida.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.710 align:middle line:84%
A gentleman by the name
of Edward Leedskalnin,

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.760 align:middle line:84%
who couldn't have been more
than 4'11", and maybe 103,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:84%
104 pounds, actually was able
to not only harvest giant blocks

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.200 align:middle line:84%
of coral, but he was
even able to cut them,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and then hoist
them into position,

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.690 align:middle line:84%
creating something
called the Coral Castle.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:10%
>> He moved over 1,000 tons
of heavy coral and molded it

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:10%
to different shapes to make this
thing without any equipment.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.990 align:middle line:84%
He would do this at
night, without people

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.582 align:middle line:90%
being able to see him.

00:24:37.582 --> 00:24:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the kids would look
over the gate to see what he

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:90%
was doing.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
They said he'd
always be whistling.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.520 align:middle line:10%
He had this contraption
on this tripod,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.800 align:middle line:10%
with this magnetic
box at the top

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.840 align:middle line:10%
and this gigantic magnetic
crank at the bottom.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And when asked, he said I've
discovered how the pyramids

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and other large structures
were built. Most likely,

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
it was sound or some other form
of electromagnetic energy that

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
they used to resonate
the stone, lift it up,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and move it as though it
was light as a feather.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It's possible that more
examples like the Coral Castle

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
will be revealed
in our lifetime.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:10%
>> We're very fortunate today
that through archaeoacoustic

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:10%
research, we are now very close
to being able to duplicate

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.190 align:middle line:10%
the effect of those
megalithic temples.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:10%
And that is
tremendously exciting.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:10%
>> Science fiction has always
been ahead of science fact.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Exploring the capacity to
control gravitational field

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:54.550 align:middle line:84%
may actually come from
understanding our far past.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The concept of
back to the future

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.780 align:middle line:84%
emerges that knowledge
from the past

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:06.040 align:middle line:84%
may lead us to an
extremely powerful

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
and successful and
sustainable future.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Assuredly, free energy
technologies are encoded within

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.510 align:middle line:90%
those megalithic temples.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Also, ways in which we
can live in a manner that

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:84%
is more harmonious
with the earth

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.900 align:middle line:84%
and will enable us to create,
ultimately, a sustainable

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
civilization--

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
that's our quest,
and that's our goal.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Coming up next on
"Sound of Creation,"

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
we travel through time to see
the many mystical ways in which

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:49.290 align:middle line:84%
sound has assisted in
humanity's evolution.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:90%
