>> It's the perfect form because
every point on the periphery

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
of the sphere is exactly
equidistant from the center,

It's angularsome.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
It's 720 degrees.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:10%
Interesting as well
that that 720 degrees

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.210 align:middle line:10%
is the foundational basis
of all greater complexity

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:10%
in all geometric forms.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Every geometry, no matter
what structure or form,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:84%
will always have
angular sums that will

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
be a multiple of 720 degrees.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
So we now know that
the foundational basis

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of all higher dimensional
solids in geometry

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
will always also be
related to the number 9.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.210 align:middle line:10%
7 plus 2 plus 0 equals 9.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So then we go beyond
the tetrahedron

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
to the next structure,
which is the cube.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:10%
It has an angular
sum of 2,160 degrees.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:10%
2 plus 1 plus 6 equals 9.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.070 align:middle line:10%
The next level would be an
octahedron, 1,440 degrees.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:10%
Again, 9.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:10%
We go on to the
icosahedron, which

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:10%
has 3,600 degrees
as its angular sum,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.140 align:middle line:10%
showing an interesting
relationship

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:10%
to the circle, the feminine.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.050 align:middle line:10%
And then we take it to the next
level with the dodecahedron,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:10%
which is giving us 6,480
degrees as its angular sum,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.440 align:middle line:10%
because it has 12 sides
of five sides each.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
interesting thing to note,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
because the icosahedron as
well has this unique structure

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that it's made specifically
only of equilateral triangles.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And from that, we have this
3,600-degree form that also

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.600 align:middle line:84%
becomes a dual-style
relationship with

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.960 align:middle line:90%
the dodecahedron.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:84%
So the dodecahedron
and icosahedron

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
have this very
unique relationship.

And it's got this one string,
monochord, with one tuning peg.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's say the string when
we pluck it is 400 hertz.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Then if I start to put my finger
on 1/3 or 2/3 or 4/5 or 5/6

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%

So that's geometry
and music right there.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So the monochord is
essentially one note that can

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
be divided into an
infinite number of notes.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
The analogy of the
monochord is alluded to

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
in many esoteric
lineages who speak

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to the creation
of the one, which

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
was then divided into the
many, which is all of creation.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:10%
>> There's an even older
instrument than the monochord

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.290 align:middle line:10%
that demonstrates the
spectrum of frequency.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> The didgeridoo is essentially
one note like the monochord,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:84%
except it is played with the
breath instead of a string.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that the word for spirit

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and the word for breath in
many languages except English

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:90%
is the same word.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.530 align:middle line:84%
So the didgeridoo is
essentially a monochord

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.655 align:middle line:90%
of the spirit made audible.

Thanks to a technology

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:90%
the answer is yes.

>> So this very powerful
relationship between sound

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.370 align:middle line:10%
and pattern really was brought
into focus when the emerging

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:10%
science of cymatics
came into focus.

>> The sound literally
can move and shape matter.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.008 align:middle line:84%
It started by Hans Jenny
who was using it on a plate,

00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and then he put certain
materials on there.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.860 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was water.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was sand.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it was clay.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
Some type of material.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And then he would pipe a certain
frequency across the plate.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And what he observed
under a microscope

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
was that the sound
interacted with the materia,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.540 align:middle line:84%
and it started to
move it and shape it.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And each unique frequency
that came across that plate

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.005 align:middle line:84%
interacted with that
matter in a unique way.

00:11:44.005 --> 00:11:48.028 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.028 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So it would create a signature
pattern within the materia.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Some of the patterns that were
formed just by a drop of water

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:84%
on the plate formed
these beautiful mandalas.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
And what he saw was that
the higher in frequency,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
the more complexity that we
would find in the mandala.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.360 align:middle line:10%
>> Because of the particular
wavelength of the sound

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:10%
and the resonant frequency
of the plate and the material

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:10%
that's on it, all of those
acting together create a static

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:10%
appearance of a figure.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.980 align:middle line:10%
And that figure
can frequently be

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.030 align:middle line:10%
something that appears in nature
like the hexagonal crystal

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.800 align:middle line:10%
or even occasionally
like a snowflake

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:10%
if it's really adapted properly.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:35.780 align:middle line:84%

more than vibration

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.870 align:middle line:10%
If we extend that
all the way out,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:10%
the 55th key becomes the note G.
That's also a Fibonacci number.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.790 align:middle line:10%
And the 89th would be the
beginning of the next piano

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.445 align:middle line:10%
cycle, because we have 88
keys on a piano keyboard.

00:18:09.445 --> 00:18:12.580 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The number 8 plays a role
in another important aspect

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller
called the cuboctahedron

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.180 align:middle line:84%
with its eight triangular
faces and six square

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:90%
faces the vector equilibrium.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the only geometry
in perfect equilibrium

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.550 align:middle line:90%
at the center.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Physicist Nassim
Haramein concluded

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:84%
that this must be the
geometry of the vacuum.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.530 align:middle line:84%
If they are stacked in
unison with each other,

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
we can create a
perfect 64 tetrahedron.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The number 64 is a very
curious number as it appears

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a compound number.

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.340 align:middle line:10%
It's 8 times 8 equals 64.

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And 8 is the number
of infinity, and we

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:10%
see this repeated
over and over again.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
We see the number 8 reflected in
the energies of our Kundalini.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians believed
that our brain essentially

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
was a figure 8 with energy just
continually moving throughout.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.020 align:middle line:10%
>> This fundamental oscillation
of creation as described

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:10%
in these ancient traditions
generated geometry from

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:10%
interference pattern.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
ancient cultures

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:84%
portrayed this geometry
in their symbolism.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And they described
basically a triangulation

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.360 align:middle line:84%
of the space,
commonly demonstrated,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.480 align:middle line:84%
for instance, in the
Hawaiian traditions

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
as a stack of triangles
and in other traditions

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.590 align:middle line:84%
as star-like
structures of triangles

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:07.085 align:middle line:84%
and various geometries that
were at the base of creation.

00:20:07.085 --> 00:20:09.860 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>> In Hebrew tradition, merkaba
literally translates to light,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:90%
spirit, and body.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The merkaba symbol
is a shape made

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:84%
of two intersecting
tetrahedrons that

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:84%
spin in opposite
directions, creating

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional
energy field.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.450 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life,
or the Kabbalah,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is considered a map
of consciousness

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and a geometric symbol
of the universe.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:10%
>> As we decode the
Kabbalistic tree, again,

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:10%
we find the 64 tetrahedron or
the sphere packing of the 64

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.890 align:middle line:10%
tetrahedron structure.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And that relates, for
instance, to other symbols

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.650 align:middle line:90%
that we find in other cultures.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
flower of life that's

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
found on the Osirion
temple in Egypt

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.390 align:middle line:84%
seem to be somehow imprinted on
a 200-ton pillar in the middle

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:90%
of a very enigmatic temple.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism, again, matched
this 64-tetrahedron grid,

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:84%
which matched the
equations of space time

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.415 align:middle line:84%
that produce a
unification of physics.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:26.190 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>> From Africa and
Europe to Asia,

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.340 align:middle line:84%
the 64 tetrahedron
symbol has deep roots.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There's I Ching,
for instance,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
having 64 symbols made
out of six sticks each.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.180 align:middle line:84%
The yin/yang,
which seems to show

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the circulation of the space
or the dynamics of the space,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:90%
the polarization of the vacuum.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Michael Hayes, the author
of "The Hermetic Code in DNA,"

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:90%
studied the I Ching.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
He pondered on why
there were eight

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:84%
by eight hexagrams
in the symbol.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And then he realized there
are eight trigrams hidden

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in the human DNA strand.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
He began to wonder
if the two offered

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:90%
a key to the code of life.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:26.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Under the paw of the Foo Dog,
it is very specific geometries.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Typically, it's
a sphere that has

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.990 align:middle line:84%
an interference
pattern on it that

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.490 align:middle line:90%
resembles the flower of life.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.030 align:middle line:10%
And so all of the
sudden, you start

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:10%
to get a sense
that this geometry

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.050 align:middle line:10%
of the 64-tetrahedron grid
that produced this interference

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.210 align:middle line:10%
pattern is fundamental and is
the source of the knowledge

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.215 align:middle line:10%
that's being guarded.

00:22:50.215 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did this
symbol originate?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
One theory is that an advanced
civilization shared it

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:90%
with ancient cultures.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It might have come from a
much deeper tradition in which

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:84%
very advanced technology might
have been present on our planet

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.780 align:middle line:90%
prior to our current evolution.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.640 align:middle line:84%
That is typically
described as technology

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.185 align:middle line:84%
that is based on frequency,
on oscillation, on sound.

00:23:27.185 --> 00:23:30.850 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And so this is kind of coming
together in an amazing way.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Actually, more amazing
than I could have ever

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:84%
imagined 35 years
ago or when I started

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.930 align:middle line:84%
to explore all these principles
both in advanced physics

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:50.310 align:middle line:84%
and in studying
ancient civilization.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
To find that that was
somehow already known

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
in ancient civilizations
is remarkable.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:04.140 align:middle line:10%
>> The 64 tetrahedron is not the
only pattern that demonstrates

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:10%
the infinite nature
of the universe.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Fractals are inherent through
every scale of creation.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:90%
>> A fractal is a reflexive--

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.920 align:middle line:84%
almost like a
holographic reiteration

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
of a similar pattern
superimposed on itself

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
at a different
scale of magnitude.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a basic pattern that
repeats itself over and over

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
again in such a way that you
can look at it at any scale

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.100 align:middle line:90%
and see the same pattern.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:40.600 align:middle line:84%
The same pattern is present
in one minute part of it

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.360 align:middle line:90%
as it is in the entirety of it.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And you can find this
in certain nature forms

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.620 align:middle line:90%
that grow in fractal patterns.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
You can also find it in the
way the atmosphere moves.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:84%
It creates a fractal pattern
in larger and larger orders

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:90%
of magnitude.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
So you start off with a little
disturbance, butterfly wings,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.765 align:middle line:84%
and you end up with a tornado or
a massive high-pressure system.

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Esoteric philosophers like
Hermes made similar statements

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
that we see now in the universe
being a sort of fractal

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.460 align:middle line:84%
hologram where everything is
reflected in everything else

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:90%
in miniature.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So this concept of Hermes
of as above, so below

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much what
we see around us

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:84%
when we think of patterns
in the universe that

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.930 align:middle line:84%
look almost exactly
the same as the pattern

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of neural connections
in your cortex.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So this idea of the
connectome in the brain,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that the neurons in my brain
are connected to other neurons

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
with axons, and the axons
form these networks,

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and the networks have a higher
order of geometric patterning

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.570 align:middle line:84%
that we see reflected almost
exactly in the universe

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:08.370 align:middle line:90%
at large.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:90%

>> What do all these geometries
and frequencies have in common?

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.970 align:middle line:10%
The Platonic

of the monochord,
cymatics, the golden ratio,

the 64 tetrahedron, the

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.480 align:middle line:84%
They all hold the
patterns that underlie
