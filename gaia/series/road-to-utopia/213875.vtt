>> Wisdom is already inside
us and it has to come out.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.277 align:middle line:84%
So how do you trigger it,
provoke it to come out?

00:00:18.277 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It's in the body
because you're coming

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.400 align:middle line:84%
into something that's like
coming into a mystery school.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.480 align:middle line:90%
It's like a labyrinth of layers.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a system of
self-development

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.090 align:middle line:84%
that helps you,
step-by-step, understand

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.670 align:middle line:84%
the suffering in your
life and transform it

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.264 align:middle line:90%
into something beautiful.

>> One of my favorite quotes
by the poet Rumi says that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:84%
the entire universe
is inside of us.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:84%
It is one of those
Rumi quotes that lands

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:90%
deeper and deeper each time.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, the industry of
personal development

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
can be approached
from endless angles.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
There are external
development approaches

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
that are focused on
hard and soft skills.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We can pick up books on how
to be a more effective leader

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.650 align:middle line:84%
or manage a team with the
newest management techniques.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.510 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we look
at internal approaches

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to self-development.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.620 align:middle line:84%
These are the
frameworks that allow

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
us to explore some of the inner
universes that Rumi talks about.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is a spiral.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:90%
So it learns from itself.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:10%
Everything has to keep
transcending and including

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:10%
and transcending and including,
and it brings everything

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.680 align:middle line:10%
with it.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It transforms everything and
then it moves everything.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.740 align:middle line:90%
We move up a level.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
when you look at history

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
and you look at different
patterns and cycles,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it might not
seem like we're learning.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
So you have to look
in much bigger epochs.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
But we're finding
it through science,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
so the two fields, ancient
and modern, come together.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a really, really key time.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
That's what the Gene
Keys is all about.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to how we do it
is not like a single one-liner.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.552 align:middle line:90%
So it's a journey.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:84%
When I was young, I had a
strange connection to nature,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
where I would go
out into the woods.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I lived in--

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I was brought up in nature,
surrounded by woods in England.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I would go out into
the woods and the forests,

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.640 align:middle line:84%
and I would have experiences of,
I guess you'd call it, ecstasy.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I would experience ecstatic
feelings, especially

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
with the light in the trees.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, I started
to seek those experiences more.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:84%
So I would spend more time
in the woods and in nature.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And even at my school, I would
sneak off and people thought

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:90%
I was going smoking and doing--

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.520 align:middle line:84%
I was actually going off
to commune with this energy

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't tell anyone.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:84%
For years, I never
told anyone about this.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to know what
is that experience that I'm

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
having and how can I
kind of enhance it.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I think unconsciously,
I wasn't following a wound.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
I was following a bliss,
and I wanted to know more.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And I had plenty of wounds,
but that came later,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:90%
that part of my story.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.180 align:middle line:84%
But that was what really
kind of motivated me,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
I think, to go around the
world, studying and exploring

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:90%
different things.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The personalized part of the
Gene Keys is based on our natal

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:90%
chart.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.630 align:middle line:84%
In my journey through
inner development,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
I have learned to navigate
different frameworks based

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.290 align:middle line:84%
on how wise they seem
to be, and therefore,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
based on how useful
it can be to integrate

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.510 align:middle line:90%
their input into my life.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.020 align:middle line:84%
For example, if a
horoscope is written wisely

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and I read someone
else's Zodiac sign,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
I may find universally
wise advice in there.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So that was my initial approach.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
By now, I have found
a lot of resonance

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.870 align:middle line:84%
in frameworks like the
Gene Keys and Human Design.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.538 align:middle line:84%
They uncover a lot of depth and
there is so much to dive into.

00:04:20.538 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of auspicious that
I've begun this process here

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
on the Isle of Ibiza because
part of the source of these

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:84%
teachings that I am bringing
out into the world began here.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
And they began with an
unusually named man, Ra Uru Hu,

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and he came to this island,
and in that experience,

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.710 align:middle line:84%
he received a system called
the Human Design System.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And it is a huge body
of work, knowledge

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.080 align:middle line:90%
that entered into the world.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
1987, so years later of a
series of synchronicities,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
I ended up on this
island meeting Ra

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and became a student of
his, and learned from him.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.623 align:middle line:90%
And he taught me many things.

00:05:00.623 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:90%
He was an extraordinary man.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.540 align:middle line:90%
He was a genius, actually.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.380 align:middle line:84%
He had one of those minds
that was incredibly well-read

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and a real ability to
speak candidly and clearly.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And he was an
unusual man, though.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I studied with
him for many years.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of how it began.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
So it began here on
this beautiful island

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:90%
in some respects.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's a nice thing for me to
be able to honor the source.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And so it became something
completely different.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what gave birth to
my body of work, Gene Keys.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Before the Gene Keys came
onto the map, in 1996,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
I had a big experience,
a mystic experience

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:84%
that lasted for three
days and three nights.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't on any drugs
or anything like that.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.560 align:middle line:90%
It was completely natural.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in my bed one
morning and I woke up

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.080 align:middle line:84%
into this other state
of consciousness.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
I just woke from sleep and
dreams into this new state.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was in this,
wow, this is different.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So for three days
and three nights,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.270 align:middle line:84%
I moved in this other
world of universal wisdom.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I went off on a journey
throughout England

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.160 align:middle line:90%
and many things kind of--

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.520 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to explain
because there

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
were dimensions that
were being shown to me

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.150 align:middle line:90%
that were in so many layers.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.690 align:middle line:84%
So everything that happened
to me in those three days

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:90%
had a kind of mythic meaning.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had many chance encounters
as I traveled throughout England

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.240 align:middle line:84%
on this kind of
intuitive adventure.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't sleep at all.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't sleep.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I was in this altered state,
so there was no sleep,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.930 align:middle line:84%
there was no wake,
there was no day,

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.150 align:middle line:84%
there was no night out
of that experience.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up in Wales
on a Welsh island,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.530 align:middle line:84%
sitting on a little hill called
Bardsey Island, allegedly

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
the place where Merlin
finished his life.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up on
that little island,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
and then I felt this
experience leave me.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.980 align:middle line:84%
It kind of went back
down into the earth.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.290 align:middle line:90%
It's like it just fell off me.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
I was back to being
Richard again.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I met my
wife and we got married.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.470 align:middle line:90%
We started having children.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
From those years, everything
started to coalesce for me.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:84%
It was like I needed an
ordinary life around me

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to ground me so
that I could then

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.710 align:middle line:84%
start to write and make sense of
the things that I'd been shown.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2004, I
had another experience,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
another three-day
experience, but I

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.370 align:middle line:84%
was right in the heart of
a fathering/parenting life.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was really inconvenient.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So at one level, I wasn't in
some shamanic trance in a cave

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.960 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, I was
changing nappies.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I was digging the garden.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I was doing the dishes.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:90%
I was arguing with my wife.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
In this ordinary life
has grown this teaching,

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's grown up in a way,
like through the cracks

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:90%
of my ordinary life.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I was seeing the god in them.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I was seeing all
kinds of layers.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I would see
someone's entire incarnations.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
I know that might
sound weird, but I

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
would see shadows of a person
behind someone, like in layers.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And if I wanted to, I
could kind of name them.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:90%
And it was really wild.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is already inside
us and it has to come out.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So how do you trigger it,
provoke it to come out?

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
It's in the body.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
So it's an embodiment
practice, the Gene Keys.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want
to teach people,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:84%
so I devised this program
with my team and my friends

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.572 align:middle line:84%
who I work with, called
the Guides Program.

00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more people
today are moving through

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and
reaching new levels of basic

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.060 align:middle line:90%
comfort.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, overall
happiness levels

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:90%
don't seem to improve with that.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I find it is a little bit
like the video game situation.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
You may get to a
new level, but that

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
comes with a whole
new set of challenges.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Challenges such as aligning
with our life purpose,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
enhancing our lifestyle,
connecting with deeper levels

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of reality, or giving back.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Those become the new questions
we have to answer for ourselves.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
There is a process
of transcendence

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.600 align:middle line:90%
that happens with that.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
We keep transcending our
existing level of awareness

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.410 align:middle line:90%
and we reach new grounds.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I have learned a lot
from Vipassana meditation

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
and from the concept of
observing our human impulses,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:84%
such as creating something
or wanting to avoid something

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
and not reacting
to those impulses.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:84%
I find that this
practice doesn't just

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
expand our
consciousness, it gets us

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.230 align:middle line:84%
into a state of equanimity
where we can really experience

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:51.970 align:middle line:90%
peace and neutrality.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.940 align:middle line:84%
From there, we can feel
desireless, but not from lack.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.235 align:middle line:84%
We feel desireless out of
experience of complete harmony

00:10:00.235 --> 00:10:01.035 align:middle line:90%
with the whole.

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:03.635 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>> My love, pour
through our soul,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.740 align:middle line:90%
weaving us together as one.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
May light flower in our
hearts, lending us the grace

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.375 align:middle line:90%
to transform all fear.

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
May clarity shine
through our mind

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.095 align:middle line:84%
as we lie in the arms
of the infinite beloved.

00:10:26.095 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.675 align:middle line:84%
May solace abound in our lives,
touching all who we meet.

00:10:38.675 --> 00:10:42.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
May solace abound in the
world, bringing all beings

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.555 align:middle line:90%
into perfect union.

00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And through that
process of learning,

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I eventually kind of came
to a realization inside me

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that the language
of it and the system

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.080 align:middle line:84%
and the way it was being
brought out into the world

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.280 align:middle line:90%
was a bit tight for me.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It felt more and
more uncomfortable.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.750 align:middle line:90%
And so I needed a new framework.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I created a new language.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:84%
The main part of the
beginning of these teachings

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
was this book that
took me seven years.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And it was a book that I used--

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:84%
what I now call the
"art of contemplation."

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:84%
That's what gave birth to my
body of work, the Gene Keys.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an information
byte for the Cosmos.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So I would just contemplate
it until I understood it,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:40.220 align:middle line:84%
until it had showed up
in my life as a teaching.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that teaching, I
would write the chapter on that

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
code, on that key, and I called
them, after a while, "Gene Keys"

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:84%
because they reflect
the code in our DNA.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.852 align:middle line:84%
It's made up of the
same 64-fold structure,

00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:90%
which is another whole story.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
But it's why they're
called Gene Keys

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's a universal
code of consciousness.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
working with these codes,

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
as I was writing it
and contemplating it,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the layers of
information, it's not

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
just information, it's wisdom
that's contained in the body,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
started to emerge.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Why we have conflicts to
why we blame each other,

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.990 align:middle line:84%
why we complain
about our neighbor,

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
it's all in the code
book of consciousness.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But each pattern that we
think has a negativity to it

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.790 align:middle line:84%
also has hidden
inside it a gift.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of key
insight of the Gene Keys.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Every shadow contains
a gift, so everything

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.420 align:middle line:84%
difficult in your life is
concealing something beautiful.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to look
at the difficult thing.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.290 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have the courage
to go really deep into it

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:84%
instead of trying to distract
yourself away from might

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:84%
be a health issue, might
be a relationship problem,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
might be some anxiety, an
issue you really can't shake,

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
or depression, or
something pretty serious.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what I
did in my writings.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
I wrote in a way that the
frequency of the words, I think,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
is more important than
the words themselves.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So the way they're
strung together

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:84%
and the way they impact
you when you read them

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
or when you hear them
has a bigger impact

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:90%
than the words themselves.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And many people I have
the same feeling that they

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.480 align:middle line:84%
read the book and then they
feel the truth resonating

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.540 align:middle line:90%
in the book.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:90%
It's something to contemplate.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a wisdom.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a wisdom stream.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.211 align:middle line:90%
It's not knowledge.

00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a lot to learn
in Vipassana and Buddhism,

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.050 align:middle line:84%
but the same goes with other
ancient disciplines that might

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:84%
seem very different from
each other and yet don't have

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:90%
contradictions.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Traditional tantra
from India is not

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
associated with sex, but with
the concept of being extremely

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
present in each moment of life.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And making love
with life itself,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
that resonates as much as
completely different practices

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:90%
like Buddhist meditation.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.540 align:middle line:84%
I believe we are here to
enjoy this life, experiencing

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
every single moment and to be
as present as possible with it.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
In that presence,
there is infinity.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:29.160 align:middle line:84%
It is the kind of infinity we
experience through love itself.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So following our joy
and exploring our bliss

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:38.830 align:middle line:84%
can be choices coming from a
high level of consciousness.

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Gene Keys realm, I had
a quandary early on, which is I

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to teach it
because it's not a teaching,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's really an untraining.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So it sort of pulls
apart any element

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that you think that
you are a teacher

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
or that you have some special
place, like your ordinariness,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:90%
out of that comes your wisdom.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have to live
it and embody it,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:90%
and then you can carry it.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Then you can--
because then someone

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:84%
will relate to you instead
of being this high, floaty,

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.635 align:middle line:84%
kind of transcendent wisdom
that which it may be.

00:15:20.635 --> 00:15:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
difference, really,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
between wisdom and knowledge.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes when
people approach this,

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
they approach it
from a knowledge view

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and they think they're
going to get something,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
and they need to understand
it in a knowledge way.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I try and say to
people, look, it's a journey

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to come
through you learning

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.050 align:middle line:90%
this art called contemplation.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
You could be in a business
meeting, you could be driving.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We had this guy, the New York
cabbie, who came up to me

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and he said, this practice
has changed my life

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
because every time I got to
a red light, I was stressed.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:90%
I was like, come on.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And now when I get
to a red light,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm completely happy
because it's a pause.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And I actually kind of
want to stay there longer.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's a pivotal
experience or a breakthrough,

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
it is something that can only
happen when you're pausing.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's very magical.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Richard talks about epochs
as long periods of time we go

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.880 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, there are
individual and collective themes

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
that can play out through the
influences of planets being

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.080 align:middle line:90%
positioned in certain ways.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Some of the big changes that
happen across generations

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.470 align:middle line:90%
get mapped out like that.

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism there are very
long, cross-generational cycles

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.860 align:middle line:90%
called the yugas.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
There are four yugas
and they last a total

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:90%
of about four million years.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
They repeat
themselves in cycles.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:84%
We are currently
in the fourth yuga,

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the shortest
one and which

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.720 align:middle line:90%
is associated with destruction.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:03.460 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the yugas
as the stages of human life

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:90%
which goes in cycles.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:84%
The fourth stage is
associated with the Hindu

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
goddess of death,
Kali, marks the ending

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.160 align:middle line:90%
of an entire yuga cycle.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.369 align:middle line:84%
What is interesting
to notice with systems

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.329 align:middle line:84%
that look at epochs of
time is the cyclical nature

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.450 align:middle line:90%
that they all have.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Cycles are in everything--

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
in nature, in our lives,
in the weather, in the way

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.420 align:middle line:90%
our earth functions.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Cycles replicate themselves
also in abstract systems

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
like economics, with bulls and
bear cycles or debt patterns

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%
of leveraging and deleveraging.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:84%
The fact that we somehow assume
we live in a linear world

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:46.610 align:middle line:84%
and we should pursue constant
linear growth is very artificial

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.792 align:middle line:84%
and feels just odd when studying
the natural world long enough.

>> So I came for a walk.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I was wandering around
the island here in Ibiza,

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and came across this
beautiful old olive tree.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to have my
book of contemplation with me.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered this passage,
so I thought I'd read it to you.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:90%
Tree Contemplation.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
We human beings live
surrounded by trees.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Although there are
areas devoid of trees,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
it's often a great challenge
to live for long in such places

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:84%
since trees are
bringers of life.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Many of us develop a natural
affinity for a particular tree.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are few
things more iconic

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
of contemplation than a
figure sitting under a tree.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you live or
travel in the world,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
let the trees around you be
your contemplative allies.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Every tree is a reminder for
you to pause and breathe.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Even if you cannot physically
pause as you go past a tree,

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.610 align:middle line:84%
let it create a pause
in your thinking.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
If you do have time, go and
stand or sit beneath a living

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:84%
tree and you'll find its soft
umbrella a perfect invitation

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
to contemplation.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.190 align:middle line:84%
The power of the tree as
a contemplative symbol

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:90%
is its perfect equilibrium.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Every tree has roots that plunge
deep into the earth, balanced

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
by branches that stretch like
fingers towards the heavens.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The tree's every
branch, twig, and root

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
is part of an
evolutionary impulse

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a dynamic
state of equilibrium.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, our contemplation is
both grounding and uplifting.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.087 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.087 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a leap of faith that
we have to take when we decide

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:90%
to explore the unknown.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
As we talked about
in other episodes,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:84%
our modern world
has just discovered

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.870 align:middle line:84%
the small tip of the iceberg
about how our reality works.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions hold
wisdom that is gradually

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
being proven by
science, so it seems

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:84%
natural to hold an open mind
to the mysteries of our world.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We get to gradually sink
into our inner universe

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and follow our bliss towards
the kind of personal development

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:90%
that resonates with us.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing about
leaps in consciousness,

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.180 align:middle line:84%
which is what we're really
talking about, a quantum leap,

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we never
see them coming.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Its purpose is to awaken
us to our true nature,

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to love, ultimately,
to forgiveness.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the Gene Keys,
the shadow becomes the gift,

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.520 align:middle line:84%
becomes the divine
awakening, the revelation.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
An age of bliss is a universe
that has as many doorways

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.110 align:middle line:90%
and paths as suffering.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Any birth is intense.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
This being is going to
come out and be born,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
born through humanity,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be born into
a new world and a new biosphere.

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's a dream-like world.
