00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:20.750 align:middle line:84%
>> My dream is to enable all
people to build the world they

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.890 align:middle line:90%
want to live in.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.680 align:middle line:10%
What I love about running a
global ecosystem in impact

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:10%
and sustainability
is that we get

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.160 align:middle line:10%
to make a difference to
where investments go,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:10%
how companies run
their businesses,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.340 align:middle line:10%
and what policies are
being implemented.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
What I do best is
analyzing an entire system

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and looking at ways to
make it more efficient.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.310 align:middle line:84%
There are endless opportunities
to create a better planet right

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.110 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.650 align:middle line:84%
What I get to see at the
forefront of positive innovation

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.310 align:middle line:90%
is mind blowing.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
We are standing at a unique
crossroads in human history.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.490 align:middle line:84%
Look at what is
happening in the world.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything is changing more
rapidly than ever before,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and we have realized that
this is going to continue.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.430 align:middle line:84%
There are two paths
available to you.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
You can focus on building
your personal utopian

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:84%
life, which naturally
contributes to the collective.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Or you can let your
energy be dragged

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:84%
into all the debates about
the problems we're facing

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
and complain about dystopia.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
You've done the
inner work, and you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.590 align:middle line:84%
are aware of your own power, so
what are you going to focus on?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
We are here to focus on
utopia in a very concrete way.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.840 align:middle line:84%
We will show you incredible
initiatives that are currently

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:84%
building an exciting
reality, and we will give you

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
a behind the scenes look at the
people who are building this.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:84%
We're here to give you tools
and knowledge to build utopia

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:90%
in your day-to-day reality.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Because if we all
live on purpose,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:84%
we are ultimately going to
create utopia on this planet.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.900 align:middle line:84%
We are taking you
on this journey

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:84%
because we believe
that it's up to you

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:84%
to manifest a utopian
life that you love living,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and that if each
one of us does that,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.840 align:middle line:84%
our entire planet will
go to the next level.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:90%

>> Throughout my career and
throughout my professional

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and personal life, I just
love to bring people together

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle line:84%
because culture and history,
you cannot prescribe.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:90%
It's organic.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%
It has to emerge.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.250 align:middle line:90%
It has to be emergent.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:84%
But you can give people tools
and frameworks and capacity

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:84%
to help codesign
their best outcomes.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:38.744 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.744 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The communities we live in
shape the way we dare to show up

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Our environments
can limit or expand

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.680 align:middle line:84%
our perspective of
what is possible.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
There is a set of
values and rules

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we agree on inside
a certain space,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a house,
a city, or a country.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Surrounding ourselves
with like-minded people

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
is much more than
a pleasant choice.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.940 align:middle line:10%
It is what empowers us to live
our lives in a certain way.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:84%
If it's not normal to
be courageous around us,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
or if the judgment of people
who make unique choices

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:84%
is embedded in the way our
community looks at the world,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.560 align:middle line:84%
it becomes much tougher for
us to show up authentically.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:32.619 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:34.860 align:middle line:90%
>> What is the utopia today?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think that
there is any one utopia.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I think we all have our own
version of the perfect community

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
or the perfect world, and
it's incumbent upon us

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to prototype and try things
and work together and cocreate

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:84%
And I started to really
develop this idea around,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.470 align:middle line:84%
how are we going to create
sustainable communities

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.890 align:middle line:90%
and cities of the future?

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:10%
What I've discovered and
I'm learning more and more,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:10%
and I say this
often, is that when

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:10%
dealing with community
or partnerships or family

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:10%
or anything, is that success
moves at the speed of trust.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.185 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Aligning the communities we
live in with certain values we

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.780 align:middle line:84%
choose is a big, big
challenge of our times.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:10%
Our culture is changing, but the
Western economic and political

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:10%
systems were not shaped
to think long term

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.020 align:middle line:10%
or to maximize the
collective good.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.820 align:middle line:84%
That is just not built
into the incentives

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and into the structures
that run our systems.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It is even more important
to create communities

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.600 align:middle line:84%
where like-minded people
who want to act with courage

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
and do things differently
can be surrounded by others

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.110 align:middle line:90%
who have similar interests.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
There is enough
friction with wanting

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.780 align:middle line:90%
to change our systems already.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.450 align:middle line:84%
Feeling accepted in
our choices can help

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.525 align:middle line:90%
us take the less-traveled road.

00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:06.572 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:90%
>> But what is a utopia today?

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.660 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother started a
version of it in the '70s.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
It began in 1974 with my
grandmother, Ma Jaya Sati

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Bhagavati, who is
also known originally

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
as Joyce Greene from
Brooklyn, New York.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.920 align:middle line:84%
She ended up moving
and relocating

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
to Florida with her
closest disciples,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and they started her
version of a utopia, which

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
is Kashi Ashram, which is an
interfaith community in Central

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Florida, in a town
called Sebastian,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
which is a very remote, small
town on the central east coast

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:90%
of Florida.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother
adopted me at birth,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I grew
up, sleeping on the temple

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.330 align:middle line:84%
floor in the ashram, meditating
at all times of the day

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
or night at the request of
my grandmother, the guru.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So now we're entering
the Dattatreya Temple,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
which is the main
temple at Kashi Ashram,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
where my grandmother,
Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:90%
taught for 40-plus years.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And I slept on the
floor, various parts.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:84%
At one point, there was 15 to 20
people sleeping on this floor.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
We would all eat
together in big groups.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So it was very much a village
and beautiful community.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And so all of the major
meditations and darshans,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
which is the teaching of the
guru, happened in this space.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very,
very potent place

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual transformation.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It was quite an active and
beautiful and intense childhood

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:84%
growing up in
community, and it was

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.930 align:middle line:84%
like growing up in a
tribe in many ways,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
but it was really focused on
feeding everybody and really

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.490 align:middle line:90%
taking care of people.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And I always wanted to be
someone unique and original

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and have my own identity.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I left the ashram,
I went to Northwestern.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And that was the first
kind of awakening I had

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of being out in the world of
what the ashram provided me.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:90%
It was a bubble.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that was something that
was unique about who I became

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.625 align:middle line:84%
is that I could meet
anybody where they were

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:20.000 align:middle line:84%
and that it didn't
matter if they

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
were a billionaire or somebody
who is sweeping the streets.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
At that point, I
became independent.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Argentina in 1998,
when the peso and the dollar

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
were 1 to 1.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It was basically the
heyday of Argentina.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This is really
what opened my eyes

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.290 align:middle line:90%
to a diverse, cosmopolitan city.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what brought me

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
into this context
of the public domain

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and public realm and
place-based development.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
And I developed a
name for myself,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and then I became a nightlife
personality in Miami.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:84%
I worked at the
top clubs in Miami,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and then I got into real estate
while I was in nightlife.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So I really focused on really
revitalizing the urban core

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.260 align:middle line:84%
through kind of
using the warehouse

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.810 align:middle line:84%
or industrial properties
as your canvas

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.230 align:middle line:84%
to reimagine a neighborhood or
reimagine a district or a city.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And it was through the lenses
of independent brands, artists,

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:90%
creatives, makers.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:90%
That was my new playground.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:90%
That was my new inspiration.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was really excited
about the prospect

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of creating and curating
and shaping neighborhoods.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.409 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted
to bring the soul,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.650 align:middle line:84%
the heart back to
main street and back

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
to neighborhood making
and placemaking.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And so I got very integrated
into kind of the cocreation

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Wynwood Arts District.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that really impacted
me, to witness that I was part

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.370 align:middle line:84%
of something-- it didn't
happen overnight--

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.840 align:middle line:84%
but was really
eye-opening for me.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It made me start to think
deeply about what I was doing

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.370 align:middle line:84%
and the impacts of
what I was doing.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, it's
through this period

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
where the Future of Cities
platform and regenerative

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.865 align:middle line:90%
placemaking was born.

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Regenerative
placemaking combines

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
regenerative development
theory or whole systems theory

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
with creative
placemaking practices.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about looking
at every situation, every place,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
every neighbor, every
community as an opportunity.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And how do we really create
and co-evolve and elevate

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
those communities
and those places

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
with these regenerative
practices and theories

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:90%
of codesign and coevolution?

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really the goal
of regenerative placemaking,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.810 align:middle line:84%
is really to get the community
to get the places to a higher

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:90%
order of existence.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're open sourcing
and prototyping

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.320 align:middle line:84%
that with advisors from
all over the world,

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:84%
from academic
institutions to artists

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to placemakers to investors
to government officials

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.820 align:middle line:90%
to urban planners.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And really, our mission
is to create a tool kit

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that we could scale through
our regenerative placemaking

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:90%
framework.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Across our projects,
across our portfolio,

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
across our businesses, is really
to rapidly prototype solutions.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
This is fundamental and
core to regenerative

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:84%
placemaking because
sustainability is not enough

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to go beyond
sustainability

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
because sustainability
is just status quo,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and we've taken so much more
than we can sustain any longer.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to reverse all
of the damage and the extraction

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.785 align:middle line:84%
that we've been doing for
the last thousands of years.

00:10:47.785 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> When we zoom out and look
at the history of communities,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
we really have to look at our
overall history as a species.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a framework I enjoy
using called spiral dynamics.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:84%
It is a model based on the
idea that our societies develop

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:90%
through stages.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
Each stage represents an
increased level of awareness

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.300 align:middle line:90%
about our environment.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:84%
There are eight stages, and
they are shown as a spiral

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
because each level alternates
between individual or collective

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.620 align:middle line:90%
organization of the society.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The two highest levels
have the core assumption

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
that the collective good is
equal to our individual good.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Level eight is the
highest, and it's

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
where we show up as
a holistic community

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
but also informed about
the complexity of life.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:45.908 align:middle line:84%
It is a level of collective
creation of abundance.

00:11:45.908 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:90%
>> It's the people.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
It's not the physical structures
that make up a community.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's, like, most people
build buildings and then expect

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:90%
the community to come.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Our version is to build
the community first

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to be informed by what you need
to build for that community,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and those spaces become
informed by the very people who

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
are going to be the
occupants and the residents

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:90%
of those spaces.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When we think about designing
the cities of the future,

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
there are two ways of improving
connection that I believe are

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
essential for us to build
beautiful environments.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.660 align:middle line:84%
One is about our
connection to other people,

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and the other part is about
our connection to nature.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
I find that
connecting with nature

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
means connecting with ourselves,
our bodies, our nature.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are also the most
relatable piece of nature

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.690 align:middle line:90%
that we can connect with.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is where connecting
within and without

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:90%
are so similar.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Connecting with other
people is a powerful mirror

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:90%
to fully accept ourselves.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.480 align:middle line:84%
That is why I believe that
diversity in our communities

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.120 align:middle line:84%
is essential as long
as we have shared

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.605 align:middle line:84%
values that are based on care
and tolerance for each other.

00:12:55.605 --> 00:13:00.940 align:middle line:84%
>> We can rewire the very DNA
of how we plan cities so that we

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:84%
optimize for humans
over automobiles,

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
and we optimize for health
over financial success,

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and we really prioritize
creating thriving cities

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.260 align:middle line:84%
of the future that everybody
wants to be in that are inspired

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
by nature, our own nature and
the nature that's all around us,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:90%
but the nature that's within us.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't want to
deal with that red tape.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.430 align:middle line:90%
But guess what.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
The only way we are going to
transcend the current situation

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
that we're in is if
we all come together

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
cross-sector collaboration

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.940 align:middle line:84%
at an unprecedented
scale like never before.

[DANCE MUSIC]

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So each of our projects
is a living laboratory,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
a demonstration project for
prototyping a new humanity where

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:90%
we give more than we take.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.730 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The mission of the
future of cities

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:84%
is to impact the lives
of a billion people

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.140 align:middle line:84%
through innovations in
the built environment.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And as a placemaker, a
community builder as we

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.720 align:middle line:84%
have a Future of Cities
climate innovation

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.720 align:middle line:84%
hub, which is our headquarters,
and it's an event space,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's a coworking space.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:84%
If you can show people I
can make more money doing

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.470 align:middle line:84%
the right thing, I think 99% of
the people will go that route.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we are aiming
to do with the Future of Cities

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is show people how you can
actually deliver higher returns

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.940 align:middle line:84%
by doing the right thing for the
community and the environment.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:84%
It forces you to be
creative and innovative

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:84%
and look for incentives and
to work with governments

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and to have public-private
partnerships, which

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:90%
are not easy.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so we created this
space on our own investment

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
to demonstrate what's possible.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:10%
And we have to keep on
iterating, iterating, iterating,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.480 align:middle line:10%
cocreating together to get
to that more perfect place.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Repurposing existing cities
and living environments is key.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.630 align:middle line:84%
If we just build
new ones, we are not

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
efficient in
resource consumption

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:90%
with brand new projects.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's ask ourselves if
they are truly needed

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
or if other buildings
could be repurposed.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.920 align:middle line:84%
That should come before even
assessing the sustainability

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.680 align:middle line:84%
of a new project based
on how efficient it

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.406 align:middle line:90%
is in using resources.

00:15:25.406 --> 00:15:28.586 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:31.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I started meeting different
people in the community,

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.680 align:middle line:84%
started listening
and learning a lot.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we made
our first investment

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
as the Phoenix Arts
and Innovation District

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.000 align:middle line:84%
here in Springfield,
Jacksonville.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:84%
We're applying for
grants and incentives

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
for state, local, federal.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:84%
We want to make it
into a food forest.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do
farmers markets.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And at every one
of these places,

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.790 align:middle line:84%
you have these tools where you
can create this circular system

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.243 align:middle line:84%
where you can really
help regenerate

00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
the community and
the neighborhood

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.320 align:middle line:84%
with them, for them, by them,
and they become part of it.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:90%
It's about understanding place.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's about respecting
place and the history

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.570 align:middle line:90%
and what's happened there.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.160 align:middle line:84%
It means every decision needs
to be made with intention

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:90%
and informed by the community.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so it just is
about deep listening,

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:22.042 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that I
have to learn every day.

It's coming back full
circle to where I was born.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.750 align:middle line:84%

I would come home.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Community has always been core
to everything that we're doing.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%

coevolution of community which

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:90%
started almost 50 years ago.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's scary, and
it's challenging,

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's beautiful
all at the same time.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:90%
And so I take it very seriously.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.369 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very special moment
here at ChoZen with my wife.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:07.930 align:middle line:90%
And my goal is how do we--

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:84%
how do we do more and have
more impact with less output?

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:90%


00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:10%
So ChoZen to us is a philosophy,
and it is also a place in nature

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:10%
that's a camp for the
humanity of the future

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:10%
and a demonstration project
for regenerative systems

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.440 align:middle line:10%
and living in a new way of
living in balance with nature

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:10%
and in community
with one another

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.386 align:middle line:10%
in a regenerative,
sustainable way.

00:17:42.386 --> 00:17:46.990 align:middle line:10%
>> We travel a lot, and there
are so many incredible places

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:10%
But what's really an
incredible opportunity for us

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.930 align:middle line:10%
is to take care of
our own backyard

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:10%
and this beautiful
river where we

00:17:55.210 --> 00:18:01.030 align:middle line:10%
see so many beautiful
creatures, manatees, alligators,

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.250 align:middle line:10%
and a ton of birds, and otters.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.003 align:middle line:90%
And it's truly magical.

00:18:06.003 --> 00:18:10.658 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.658 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature is our north star,
is our guiding principle.

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's really,
after everything,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.880 align:middle line:84%
the synthesis of
what we're doing.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And so our philosophy
here at ChoZen

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.780 align:middle line:84%
is based on three very
simple principles,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that nature is medicine,
food is medicine,

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and community is medicine, and
that these three principles is

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.440 align:middle line:84%
really what we need to
thrive and to be healthy.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we're
growing our own food,

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:84%
leveraging permaculture
principles and regenerative

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
soil and regenerative
agriculture and resource

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
management and composting
and solar systems

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and alternative energy
and rapidly prototyping.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we're reimagining
and modernizing

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.665 align:middle line:84%
and updating that vision within
the framework of ChoZen Retreat.

00:18:56.665 --> 00:18:59.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:02.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we're reimagining
what's possible.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
The new version of utopia,
built on the shoulders

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:07.300 align:middle line:84%
of my grandmother
and many thousands

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
of people and all of the
community, my brothers

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
and sisters and
sustainable kashi

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that started the ecovillage
and the permaculture program

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.815 align:middle line:84%
and now ChoZen farm and
picking up this baton.

00:19:17.815 --> 00:19:20.374 align:middle line:90%


00:19:20.374 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Designing and redesigning
communities is such a powerful

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.620 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything comes
alive there, from how

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
we shape our external
infrastructure, like setting up

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:84%
sustainable systems
or moving off

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
grid, all the way to
our internal values

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and the rules we choose to
enable a productive coexistence.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Communities are a melting
pot of innovation.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
They are the testing
ground for new ways

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.372 align:middle line:84%
in which we can thrive together
and walk on the road to utopia.

00:19:54.372 --> 00:19:57.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I hope that there will
be regenerative placemaking

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
practitioners all
over the world,

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that that
will be my legacy.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And whether we impact
100 people, 1,000 people,

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
a million people,
billions of people,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:84%
as long as we made an impact,
I think that we've lived a good

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And as long as I've been a good
husband, a good brother, family

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.340 align:middle line:84%
member, and a good
community leader,

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle line:84%
then I think that I've
lived a very healthy life

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and lived a very full life
and a very purposeful life.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I hope that the
work that we're doing

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and the investments
that we made will have

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:90%
ripples all over the world.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.396 align:middle line:90%
