00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Spiritual actually
means to breathe.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.152 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the Latin
root spirare, breath, life.

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Actually, you could
say breath word

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:84%
comes from these ancient
spiritual practices.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And really Pranayama is like a
pharmacy of different breathing

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.760 align:middle line:84%
techniques, where science
is now catching up

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.280 align:middle line:84%
with what the ancients
knew thousands of years

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:84%
ago and showing how many
incredible health benefits there

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
are from these whole variety
of different techniques.

we take day and night 24/7,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:84%
awake and asleep
for our entire life.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:90%
And that is breathing.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
We start our lives
with an inhale

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:90%
and we end them with an exhale.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do we know so little
about something so essential

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:90%
to our lives?

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.160 align:middle line:84%
We may think that breathwork
is a recent trend,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:90%
but its roots are very ancient.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of our cultures used
to give massive importance

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:90%
to mastering our breath.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
They used it to
improve their health

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
and even to achieve
altered states.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
breathwork dates back

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.090 align:middle line:84%
to the origins of
yoga as a practice.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
That is more than
2,500 years ago.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
It was, and it is
still called Pranayama.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.240 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient Indian
language of Sanskrit,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.070 align:middle line:84%
prana means life energy,
and yama means control.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Our breath allows us to
control our life energy.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.810 align:middle line:84%
That in itself is a whole
universe to explore.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Because when you
breathe in a rhythm,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
you actually create
this state of coherence,

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
especially when you put
an intention behind it,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
a positive intention.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And this creates a
harmony in a harmony,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
and amplifies the
electromagnetic field

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of your heart.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I made a pact that I have to
put as much science evidence

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
to support these
ideas, but also make

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
it fun, accessible,
enjoyable for all,

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.170 align:middle line:84%
because I really believe that
with these techniques and tools

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
I teach, the world can become
a much better place for all.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
history of breathwork?

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.520 align:middle line:90%
Where does it all come from?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
This is something that the yogis
understood thousands of years

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.270 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Now modern science is
now catching this up.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The slow rhythmic breathing
around six breaths per minute

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
or between 6 and 10
breaths per minute

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.830 align:middle line:84%
can do magic for
fully oxygenating

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
every cell in your body,
but also harmonizing

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.640 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system, restoring
balance, and allowing

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:90%
you to think more clearly.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about slowing
the breathing down and even

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
stopping and holding the
breath in various ways.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's very different to what
these modern types of breathwork

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:90%
is about.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So what I learned was
actually Pranayama.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And Pranayama, I would say, is
the source of all breathwork.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.455 align:middle line:84%
And all the breathwork
styles that we exist today.

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Just like with yoga and
other ancient disciplines,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
there is a Renaissance
of breathwork happening

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.330 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.070 align:middle line:84%
There is an adoption of
ancient Eastern wisdom

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.060 align:middle line:84%
into modern Western society
that I find so interesting.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Here is where
diving into stories

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.460 align:middle line:84%
from those ancient cultures
can put us even more

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:90%
in touch with their wisdom.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.910 align:middle line:84%
It becomes more
understood because we

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:90%
can feel it through stories.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I have also found that conscious
breathing is very powerful

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.970 align:middle line:84%
when we are processing
intense emotions.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Our breath is an alchemizer.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It enables life,
and it's right there

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to help us transmute
emotions too.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:90%
So I give you an example.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.270 align:middle line:84%
There is an ancient
Hindu scripture

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:90%
called the Bhagavad Gita.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
heard it years ago,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I understood the
back of a guitar.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But there is no a guitar
because Bhagavad Gita

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.760 align:middle line:90%
means the song of God.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And so in the Bhagavad
Gita, we follow a dialogue

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
between Prince Arjuna
and his guide, Krishna,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:84%
who shares with Arjuna
a detailed set of wisdom

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.490 align:middle line:84%
through the life situations
that Arjuna faces.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It all starts with a
war, where Arjuna has

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:90%
to face various moral dilemmas.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
We can all relate
to Arjuna as people

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
who want to align with
high moral choices.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet we also have to
face the challenges of life.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Krishna helps Arjuna
apply concretely

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.130 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of ancient India,
and he talks about the breath

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
He explains how
our breath can be

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
leveraged to achieve altered
states of consciousness,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.996 align:middle line:84%
and how it can be used
as a symbol of sacrifice.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Rigveda, which is
actually the most ancient Vedic

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:84%
text, there is a mention
of a substance called Soma.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Around 50,000 times,
it's referenced.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And Soma was this substance
that the gods at the time

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
were completely addicted to
and dependent on because it

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.800 align:middle line:90%
gave them immortality.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it gave them
a connection to the divine,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was really like a
panacea for everything.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.000 align:middle line:84%
So they were obsessed with
it and addicted to it.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
However, the Soma
starts to run out,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and this is when all the
gods at that time who

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.850 align:middle line:84%
were living in this
golden age of our planet,

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:84%
where there was far less humans
on the planet, all living

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
in harmony with nature, start
to actually get very, very

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
concerned because they're so
dependent on this substance,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
but now there's less of it.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, what they did
was they went inwards

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.570 align:middle line:84%
to discover how to create
the Soma from within.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.846 align:middle line:84%
And actually this became
the origin of spirituality.

benefits of conscious breath,

so many threads open up.

For instance, what
is the benefit

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
of improving the
oxygenation of the blood?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:84%
It helps with physical
endurance and overall health.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.660 align:middle line:84%
The main way in which I get
into intense breathing patterns

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:90%
is through physical exercise.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:84%

moment to shout out

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:90%
to the power of working out.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.660 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
day, working out

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.740 align:middle line:84%
isn't just about
moving our body.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.090 align:middle line:84%
It's also about altering
our breathing patterns

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.640 align:middle line:84%
to bring more oxygenation
all across the body.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And besides that, our lungs are
also the biggest waste removal

engine in our entire body.

chose pharmacy versus--

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's supposed to
be a helping profession,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel like I was
helping people at all.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I saw people
come in and miserable

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.420 align:middle line:84%
and becoming even more
miserable, not happier.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And I instantly felt
completely miserable

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.620 align:middle line:84%
the moment I stepped
into this role.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it was this real
feeling of something

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:84%
was wrong with this system,
because I was seeing people

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.820 align:middle line:84%
going away with shopping bags
full of drugs every single day,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:90%
they weren't getting better.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with a little
system, a shopping list system,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.650 align:middle line:84%
which would give people an
informed choice when they went

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
to the supermarket so
they could buy recipes

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
for food and little remedies
they could make if they had

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
a cough or cold or
some kind of thing

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
that they would usually
buy from a pharmacy

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:90%
like over-the-counter.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, within a few
weeks of doing this,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.320 align:middle line:90%
I got incredible results.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I actually had doctors calling
me up going, what are you doing?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.850 align:middle line:90%
At first I was like terrified.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.558 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I was
going to be in trouble.

00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:26.192 align:middle line:84%
But actually they
were urging me on

00:08:26.192 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:84%
to keep going
because I was getting

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.560 align:middle line:84%
such good results, getting
people off the medications.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
However, this got me
fired from my first job.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:84%
I was considered to be
mismanaging the pharmacy.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
However, one of the largest
supermarket chains in the UK

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
headhunted me and
actually urged me on

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to take a job with
them because they said,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
you're a renegade pharmacist.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.020 align:middle line:90%
We need more people like you.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.608 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold,
I actually got

00:08:50.608 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
promoted to the head office of
one of the biggest supermarket

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.210 align:middle line:90%
chains in the world.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually a bit of
a renegade in this system

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:01.070 align:middle line:84%
because I'm telling people
not to drink fizzy drinks

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
and eat processed
foods and to actually

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.400 align:middle line:90%
try more healthier options.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, this doesn't
resonate with the system.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So in the end, they shelved my
idea, this healthy shopping list

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:90%
idea.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.200 align:middle line:84%
I really lost my faith in
something higher than myself.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:84%
I got struck almost
like a lightning bolt

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
with a chronic disease called
ulcerative colitis, which

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
is a really, really
debilitating condition to have.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty much housebound
for a year wearing a nappy,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.825 align:middle line:84%
and I was pretty
much surrendering

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:90%
to this condition with no hope.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.190 align:middle line:90%
And I went to the--

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
I remember going to the
gastroenteritis specialist who

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:84%
told me, just shut up
and take the pills.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was so depressed
that on the final visit

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:84%
to the gastroenterologist,
they gave me two options.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Either have your colon
removed, wear a nappy

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your life
and a colostomy bag, or two,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.080 align:middle line:84%
become a Guinea pig for a drug
that hasn't been tested before.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, well,
this is all I've got left.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And they say, God stands
for Gift of Desperation.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.360 align:middle line:84%
In this most desperate moment in
my life where I was completely

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.280 align:middle line:90%
broken, I prayed.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:90%
I prayed really hard.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And by sheer faith, someone
came to me with some answers

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and she offered me a third path.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:35.490 align:middle line:84%
He said, look, I can teach you
some stuff from this system.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.847 align:middle line:84%
Can't guarantee it will
work, but at least maybe you

00:10:39.847 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
can give this a go
and you never know.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
You may be an amazing
role model for others

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:90%
if this helps you heal.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And I gave it a go because
I had no other option.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I got so much
relief from the simple breathing

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
practices that she
taught me from Pranayama

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:90%
that I was blown away.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:84%
I uncovered so many
incredible insights.

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
How much hidden knowledge
there is around just simple

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.520 align:middle line:84%
breathing techniques
that we can do that

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.697 align:middle line:90%
makes such a powerful change.

00:11:09.697 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And I found that there was
already so much science

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So I started to
collate this science

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and started to actually
practice these techniques

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:90%
at a very deep level.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is how I came
up with Soma breath.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
We produce large amounts
of it during the spirits,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.380 align:middle line:84%
so that makes you
feel really good.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So now you have a technique
where you create this medicine--

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:90%
oh, come on.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry if you don't
get the technique right now.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I'll be guiding you
all the way through it.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.224 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.224 --> 00:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to innovation
in the breathwork space,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it comes down to
bringing good breath techniques

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:90%
to as many people as possible.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:90%
It is a little bit like yoga.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
You just have to find
your own way to practice

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
and to do it on
an ongoing basis.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
Niraj does this by training
thousands of practitioners

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.960 align:middle line:84%
to deliver their breath
techniques around the world.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Soma breath has grown into a
huge movement around the world

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:15.350 align:middle line:84%
for over 2,000 instructors, all
delivering and very well trained

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
in how to deliver this
pharmacy of different breathing

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.900 align:middle line:90%
techniques.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Pranayama is like a pharmacy
of different techniques.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to,
as a pharmacist,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
really showcase all of these.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd also
created was an experience

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
which combines a lot
of Pranayama techniques

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
together in a sequence that has
extraordinary health benefits

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:90%
to your cardiovascular system.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So this is when I
created Soma breath

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and we go really deep into
more using the power of words

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and imagery to help shape and
reprogram the unconscious mind,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
because this is a source of all
of our actions and decisions.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And your quality of life
depends on your ability

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.010 align:middle line:84%
to have understanding of how the
mind works and to reprogram it.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So Soma breath became, not just
a functional breathing school,

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but also a breath
therapy school,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.480 align:middle line:84%
where we have a lot of
breath therapy techniques

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.927 align:middle line:84%
which are working
very powerfully.

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I really wanted to
look at breath work

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
as a pharmacy of
different techniques.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are techniques for
emotional release, trauma

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.950 align:middle line:84%
release, and letting go
of old tension and stress

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that's been really holding
you back from pushing forward.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But also there are
techniques that

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
are designed for improving
functions of your body.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system, your
cardiovascular system,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
switching off stress,
slowing down aging,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:90%
increasing your lifespan.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the foundation
of Tantric yoga and Pranayama

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is actually slow,
rhythmic breathing.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I have also found that
conscious breathing is very

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
powerful when we are
processing intense emotions.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:90%
Our breath is an alchemizer.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:90%
It enables life.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's right there to help
us transmute emotions too.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the cycles
of life in our episode

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%
about personal development.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
From a scientific
perspective and in line

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.500 align:middle line:84%
with modern research, we
can look at our breath

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
through the nervous system.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Studies are showing how certain
breathing techniques stimulate

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic
nervous system, which

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
correlates to our rest
and digest response.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:90%
That is to help us relax.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We have all been
in those situations

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
where we just have
to take a big breath.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Breath of relief.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.010 align:middle line:84%
That is also what we try
to do with our system

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.960 align:middle line:90%
after an intense situation.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We take a big breath and we
get ourselves to relax again.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Most people can
hold their breath

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.450 align:middle line:84%
for a maximum of
one or two minutes.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:84%
In 2021, Budimir
Sobat from Croatia

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:00.970 align:middle line:84%
held his breath underwater
for almost 25 minutes.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
That is the power of
controlled breathing.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I find that our breath
is the simplest example

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of how we move in cycles.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And on this note,
our breath can also

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.770 align:middle line:84%
make us feel balanced
in very easy ways.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:84%
I like the alternate
nostril breathing technique.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:84%
You inhale through
the right nostril,

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.940 align:middle line:84%
then you pause and then you
exhale from the left nostril.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:90%
That is half the cycle.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You complete it by breathing
through the left nostril,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.650 align:middle line:84%
posing and breathing out
through the right nostril.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.565 align:middle line:84%
These can help balance the
two hemispheres of our brain.

00:15:37.565 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, I've
just become a dad.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to teach
our kids everything,

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:84%
right from how to eat,
how to poop, how to pee.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But there's one thing we
don't have to teach them,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's how to
breathe, or do we?

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.300 align:middle line:84%
You see, I really want to
be teaching my daughter

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.237 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
conscious breath control,

00:16:00.237 --> 00:16:01.820 align:middle line:84%
because with conscious
breath control,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
she can take back
control over things

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that we believe we
have no control over.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.330 align:middle line:84%
I really want to teach the kids
this stuff because I believe

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that with the tools and
techniques that we teach in Soma

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
breath, if you think
about this, you

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
can go without food for
weeks, water for days,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.480 align:middle line:84%
but breathing just
a few minutes.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.470 align:middle line:84%
So really it should be the
first thing we talk about.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, even some
of the top longevity experts

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:84%
in the world have ignored
the importance of the breath,

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.552 align:middle line:84%
maybe because it's
too simple, too easy.

00:16:32.552 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
take for granted.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But actually it's
really important

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
because I really
believe that we can

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.510 align:middle line:84%
solve three of the
big mysteries of life

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
when we take control
of the breath.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Death, disease, and
even pursuit of bliss,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.340 align:middle line:84%
happiness, and the
meaning of life

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.110 align:middle line:84%
to make a really big
impact in people's lives.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Because the breath should be
the first thing we master.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But with the breath and a
breath-based system way of life,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.070 align:middle line:84%
you can actually create
bliss on command.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:05.579 align:middle line:84%
You can feel happy and
blissful just from your breath,

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's completely
free and never runs out.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And it means you're going to be
less dependent and less in need

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%
of stuff to fill that void.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:18.440 align:middle line:84%
So overconsumption, this
very endless consumer system

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, is really
affecting the environment,

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.000 align:middle line:84%
our planet, and the health
of our planet and people.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe we can
solve some really big issues

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.060 align:middle line:84%
by making people more aware
the magic of the breath.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to our breath,
there is a whole universe

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:90%
to explore within.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to our
preferences and how

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:84%
we can integrate
conscious breathing

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.030 align:middle line:90%
into our day-to-day lives.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Richard Rad from
the Gene Keys talks

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:84%
about stopping to take
three conscious breaths.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:90%
It is a great starting point.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And in some moments, it can
make all the difference.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So going back to that
time where I had two choices,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:90%
I had to make that bold choice.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.330 align:middle line:84%
I had to let go of my
disbelief and trust

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
in these spiritual
practices, which

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
didn't have that much
science at that point

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.010 align:middle line:84%
and had to put the
faith into them.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so glad I did because
making that bold choice has led

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:84%
to this incredible
life that I now

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
am so grateful to have
in this day and age

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.250 align:middle line:84%
because we have so much
opportunity, so much

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:84%
abundance of technology
and just so many

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
incredible things we can
do if we focus and learn

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the right strategies and go deep
and go fully in to maximizing

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.825 align:middle line:84%
the potential of this incredible
world we actually live in today.

00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that through
breathing together and learning

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.750 align:middle line:84%
to breathe better,
we can actually

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:90%
make the world a better place.
