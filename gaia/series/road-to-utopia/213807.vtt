00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.210 align:middle line:84%
>> What I see here is
a great opportunity.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's an opportunity to
move from an old linear model

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:84%
to a new circular and
regenerative economy model.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:84%
We are the vanguard
of the transition.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:84%
And what we're here to do is
to facilitate the transition

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:90%
to a new economy.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
We are in the crossroad
and we have the chance

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
to change course towards a
greener and better and more

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.868 align:middle line:90%
sustainable planet.

00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the world around us
made of and how does our economy

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.450 align:middle line:90%
really work?

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Everything we see and
touch was made somewhere

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and it's made of materials
that come directly from nature

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:84%
or have gone through
a certain process.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
In the past decades,
we expanded our economy

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.150 align:middle line:84%
to produce more
than ever before.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the last
years, we understood

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:90%
the price of this expansion.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
90% of raw materials
used in manufacturing

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:84%
become waste before the
product leaves a factory.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
80% of products get thrown
away in the first six

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:90%
months of their existence.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There are billions
of dollars that

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
could be saved each year
with the implementation

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:90%
of a new circular economy.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So is it true that we
have limited resources

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
or do we just need to
upgrade the way we deal

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.430 align:middle line:90%
with our resources?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So right now, we are at
the brink of the collapse

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of our natural environment.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
If we don't change the way
we make and consume products,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
we're going to radically change
the landscape of our Earth

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and go on a straight line
towards the destruction

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:90%
of our planet and ourselves.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:84%
I love the planet so much
that I want to see it thrive.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.730 align:middle line:84%
How can we create products
that not only live in harmony

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
with nature, which
is sustainability,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
which is being neutral but how
can we regenerate the Earth?

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.380 align:middle line:84%
How can we move
away from plastic

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.273 align:middle line:84%
and how can we find
alternatives to plastic?

00:02:26.273 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
If we are destroying
the planet, I

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
realize we are destroying the
pure essence of who we are,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.710 align:middle line:90%
which is this collective being.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So that sparked the
idea of then creating

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Pangea and the deep
meaning of Pangea,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:90%
which is the world being one.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
Pangea, Pangaea means
"Everything Earth."

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was a planet before
it split into continents.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.053 align:middle line:84%
So it's that
essence of the union

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:49.470 align:middle line:84%
and the connection
with the planet

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and creating something that
would benefit the Earth.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And using consumerism as a
way of benefiting the planet

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:90%
rather than harming it.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What is exciting is that the
transformation that lies ahead

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of us is a key step in our
evolution on planet Earth

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:90%
as an advanced civilization.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Nature has had millions of
years to refine its processes.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
In nature, everything develops
as a balanced ecosystem.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
There are feedback loops built
into the way evolution works.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Look at animals in the savanna.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:84%
As lions become faster,
gazelle get a bit faster too.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.750 align:middle line:84%
If lions suddenly had access
to weapons and technology,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
they would catch way
more gazelles than usual.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.650 align:middle line:84%
In that process, they would
risk running out of gazelles

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.330 align:middle line:84%
and starve themselves
into extinction.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:84%
The human species has
found ways to climb

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to the top of the food chain
through weapons and technology.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.010 align:middle line:84%
We are able to coordinate among
ourselves in a way that other

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:90%
animals can't.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We are able to use innovation
to outsmart our environment.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
These are the signs of
an advanced civilization.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
But with great power comes
great responsibility.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's not about the
survival of our planet.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.750 align:middle line:90%
That's not at risk.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's about our
survival on this planet

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
because in this
rapid evolution, we

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
have not managed yet to
create the feedback loop that

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:90%
makes nature so resilient.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
The ecosystem we depend
on has lost balance.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
>> I grew up in Buenos
Aires, which is a huge city,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:90%
the capital of Argentina.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.880 align:middle line:90%
Since a very young age.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.332 align:middle line:84%
my father used to
take me camping.

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first
time we went camping

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:90%
is when I was four years old.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And each time we go to the
outdoors, to the mountains,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.790 align:middle line:84%
I always felt a big
connection to the planet

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.780 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of peace.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:10%
So nature always had a very
special role in my life

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.980 align:middle line:10%
throughout my childhood as a
place where I could feel peace

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.888 align:middle line:10%
and I could get a little bit out
of the craziness of the city.

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That deep connection I had with
nature and with the mountains

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.233 align:middle line:84%
and with the oceans, I
wanted to explore more

00:04:54.233 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:90%
when I finished high school.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:84%
I felt like it was pushing
everyone to do the same thing.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt like
I didn't want to follow

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:90%
the steps of everyone else.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find my own path.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And my own path was
taking me to the wild,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.580 align:middle line:84%
was taking me to go to the
outdoors and explore the planet.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.590 align:middle line:84%
The first trip I did when
I finished high school,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I packed my backpack with a
bunch of books, some clothes,

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.390 align:middle line:90%
and I hitchhiked to Patagonia.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I took a year to
travel all the planet.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I spent 12 months
traveling the five continents.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, I remember
once I was in Thailand

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and I went snorkeling.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And there was a moment in which
I was floating in the ocean

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and I felt a deep connection
with the whole planet.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
In that feeling of unity with
the whole world, I realized,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
myself, Marcos Bulacio,
whatever that means,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.810 align:middle line:84%
is actually part of
something bigger,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and that something bigger
is the whole planet.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.900 align:middle line:84%
So I felt a deep connection
with the ocean, the plants,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and everything around us.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that what we
truly are is the planet itself.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:84%
So then after that, I
traveled and I went to Bali.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.790 align:middle line:84%
I came to Bali for the first
time because I love surfing.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And I was surfing
and I found myself

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
paddling in an ocean
full of plastic.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then that made me realize
that we must radically

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
change the way we make
and consume products,

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, we're
self-destroying ourselves.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature has already taught
us so many ways to innovate.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.840 align:middle line:84%
We have learned from
biological processes

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:90%
how to produce better materials.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:90%
This is called biomimicry.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at mushrooms,
they are the recyclers

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
of materials in nature.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
They break down
that organic matter

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.860 align:middle line:90%
and turn it back into minerals.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.630 align:middle line:84%
A startup in California figured
out how to make mycelium

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
grow into new structures that
can be turned into batteries,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
spaceships, trains, cars,
shoes, houses, kids' toys,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
bulletproof vests, anything
made out of wood or robots.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.820 align:middle line:84%
They connected the
dots on something

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:84%
that was always in
front of our eyes.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Mycelium was on the planet
since way before us humans.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Today, the
mushroom-based materials

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
are used by some of the
leading global brands.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.920 align:middle line:84%
They create all
kinds of materials

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
that replace plastic leather
and other unsustainable sources.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
>> After that trip around
the world and having the idea

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of creating Pangea,
at that moment,

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
it was something that was
going to be helping the planet.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:84%
I decided to start creating
products designed for traveling,

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
designed to solve the
problems of the nomads.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with the idea of
creating an alternative towel

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.060 align:middle line:84%
that is going to be
made of bamboo, which

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.050 align:middle line:84%
is a renewable and natural
resource that is actually

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%
biodegradable.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
So that at the end
of the life cycle,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.060 align:middle line:84%
instead of polluting the planet
forever with more microplastics,

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:84%
it's actually going
to biodegrade.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Added this impact model in which
for every towel that we sold,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to clean
one kilogram of trash

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.150 align:middle line:90%
from the planet.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.737 align:middle line:90%
So I came to Bali.

00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:18.820 align:middle line:90%
I was staying in a hostel.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.540 align:middle line:90%
I had $2,000 in my bank account.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I was working also with
my co-founder, who was

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.220 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco at the moment.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:84%
After that trip
around the world,

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I took a course, an incredible
program of entrepreneurship

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and innovation at Harvard, then
the clear idea came to my mind.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:90%
I realized I need to--

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to create
something that will

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
allow me to live in Bali
while making positive impact,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
and that is connected
to the travel

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:90%
industry for the backpackers.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.183 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to start
this travel brand together

00:08:47.183 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:84%
while we were traveling
through South America.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
In that trip, we also realized
that everywhere we went,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:90%
there was trash.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.577 align:middle line:84%
Every beach we go,
there is trash.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that I've
seen throughout all my travels.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to sell
products for other backpackers

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and travelers like us
like we were back then.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And also started
organizing cleanups

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and funding these initial
cleanups with those products.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Since the beginning,
when we started cleaning,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
we got really,
really good volume.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.150 align:middle line:84%
We started organizing
cleanups all around the world,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle line:84%
collecting thousands of
kilograms of trash per month.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.550 align:middle line:84%
But then the next
question was what

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
do we do with all this trash?

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And so that sparked the idea of
creating the Plastic Innovation

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Center in Bali and being able
to turn 5,000 kilograms of trash

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
that we cleaned with a huge
cleanup that we organized

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
in the Philippines
with 1,500 volunteers,

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
into mangrove sunglasses that
were basically funding that

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.600 align:middle line:84%
cleanup and then turning
the trash of the cleanup

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.010 align:middle line:90%
into a valuable product.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Our next evolutionary step
as an advanced civilization is

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
to create balance in our
systems and in the way we use

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.035 align:middle line:90%
our resources.

00:10:00.035 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
This is where the circular
economy comes into play.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
A circular economy
is different from

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.940 align:middle line:84%
our traditional linear economy,
where we take, make, and waste.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.150 align:middle line:84%
In a circular system,
there is no waste

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.650 align:middle line:90%
because waste doesn't exist.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just materials
in the wrong place.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So to understand
circular economy, first,

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
we need to understand
linear economy.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So the current production model
all around the world is linear.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So it starts by extracting
natural resources

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.890 align:middle line:84%
from the planet and
then creating products

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
that are designed to be
discarded at the end of the life

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically extracting
natural resources,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
polluting the Earth,
and then discarding

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
planets that keep polluting
the Earth forever.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
So circular economy means
making that linear process

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:84%
or that linear model
circular, in a way

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
that we can keep re-utilizing
the plastic that was produced.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we can recycle
the existing plastic

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.950 align:middle line:84%
into new products,
into a closed loop,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that instead of
polluting the Earth,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
it actually goes back to
production over and over again.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And instead of designing
them to be discarded,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:90%
designing them to be recycled.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So we can keep recycling
the plastic that exists

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.000 align:middle line:90%
over and over on a closed loop.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
The first cleanup
was here in Bali

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was just a
handful of people.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And as we progressed, then
instead of taking care of only

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
the surface problem,
the surface issue,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.320 align:middle line:84%
which is trash
sitting in the planet,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.450 align:middle line:84%
we realized and we learned that
80% of all the trash that enters

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.790 align:middle line:84%
the oceans comes from
about 1,500 rivers.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.820 align:middle line:84%
So we started placing
river barriers

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:84%
to stop the trash before
it enters the oceans.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we went
one step forward,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.860 align:middle line:84%
which is solving the
issue from the core, which

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:90%
is the generation of new trash.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.370 align:middle line:84%
So right now, what
we're doing is

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.670 align:middle line:84%
we are replacing products
that pollute the planet

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:84%
with circular products that
are made from the waste,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.020 align:middle line:84%
from plastic that already exists
and designed to clean the Earth

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.210 align:middle line:90%
and plant new trees.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It was just a handful of people.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And we grew the cleanups to a
global movement with more than

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.375 align:middle line:84%
3,500 volunteers in 12
countries around the world.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:16.770 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
>> 70% of the world's plastic
is not being recovered,

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and that translates into
a hundred and twenty

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.870 align:middle line:84%
billion-dollar loss
to the economy.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.650 align:middle line:84%
That is tangible
economic value from waste

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.790 align:middle line:84%
that we are leaving
on the table.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.760 align:middle line:90%
This applies to all materials.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Look at what our
streets are made of.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Plastic is made of petroleum.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And asphalt is made
with petroleum, too.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Today, only 10% of the
annual 13 trillion tons

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
of disposed asphalt
are being recycled.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%
But this is starting to change.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
The leading manufacturer
of roofing materials

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:84%
in North America has found a
way to recycle 90% of asphalt

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.660 align:middle line:90%
into new roofs.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
So now that we know
this is possible,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:03.490 align:middle line:84%
who else is going to
follow their footsteps?

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.130 align:middle line:84%
The next step ahead of us is to
recreate the feedback loops that

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.310 align:middle line:84%
exist in nature by making
our supply chains transparent

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and reconnecting with where
our products come from,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
by seeing whether the
way they are produced

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
pollutes or
regenerates the Earth.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We have all the technology
we need to do this already.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Here is the river
barrier's trash.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So this is coming from Sumatra,
and they ship it to us here.

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the ghost nets,
which is a new supply chain

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:39.210 align:middle line:90%
that we're building.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
going to be separate it,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
get rid of different
types of rope

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.330 align:middle line:84%
because, basically,
different types

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
of nets and different
types of rope

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
are different types of plastic.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:10%
So after washing the plastic,
we send it for shredding.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:01.835 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it comes
from the shredding machine.

00:14:01.835 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
So here, what we're
going to do as well

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.470 align:middle line:84%
is we will mix the flakes
with an impact modifier, which

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:84%
is a chemical
compound that is going

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.040 align:middle line:84%
to make the plastic
much stronger

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and increase the
flexibility as well.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And we mix our own plastic with
other recycled polypropylene

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:22.000 align:middle line:84%
pellets that are post-consumer
plastic pellets from Java.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So then we prepare
the color formula.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So here, what we have is
the ocean blue sunglasses.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So for ocean blue,
what we have is

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the mangrove plastic with
some post-consumer plastic

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
pellets as well.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have the impact
modifiers inside as well.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're going
to use to inject the molds.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.340 align:middle line:84%
So these are the machines
that we imported from England.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we're
going to take the plastic

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and add it into the
injection machine.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is going
to melt the plastic

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.125 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to manually
inject it into the molds.

00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:09.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Our current state
is very handcrafted.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing
is-- the first stage

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:84%
is to clean the impurities
of the injection.

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get rid of
all these excess plastic parts.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Then we're going to
assemble the hinges.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the hinges are
what's going to allow

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
us to put the frames
together with the temples.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going
to sand them to create

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.660 align:middle line:90%
a very nice finishing.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, assemble
the lenses and wash them,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and they're ready to go.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
finalized City design.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:54.590 align:middle line:84%
That's the design of this
frame in the seal-gray color.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of our
ocean guard campaign.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.430 align:middle line:84%
And this one now will
need some final cleaning

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be ready
to ship to our customers.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Over 50% of customers
investigate their brand's social

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:90%
responsibility.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And over 60% of customers
want to purchase

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:90%
from more sustainable brands.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
A brand with real
purpose doesn't shy away

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
from doing things differently,
from giving us transparency,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and from connecting
with our deepest values.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.100 align:middle line:84%
As consumers of
products, we have all

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
heard before about how to
recycle or how to consume less,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:84%
but to align our lives with
making a positive impact,

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:90%
we've got to walk that walk.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The biggest resource
we all have is what

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.690 align:middle line:90%
we choose to put our time into.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
So what if we all dare
to find a career that

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
is on purpose, a
career that aligns

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:90%
with our natural interests?

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:51.080 align:middle line:84%
That is the most powerful way we
have to make a real difference.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.070 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to the
circular economy,

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:84%
there are endless opportunities,
both for new and old brands.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Innovation is a part of
the natural flow of life.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
When we go with it,
when we sync up with it,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:84%
we become part of positive
change effortlessly.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Circularity is a mindset
and we can think circularity

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.940 align:middle line:90%
across all parts of our lives.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to create a world
where my daughter can swim

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.480 align:middle line:84%
in a plastic-free ocean and
where the new generation of kids

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:84%
can still enjoy the
beauty of a clean beach.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we think
about the rivers,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.640 align:middle line:84%
the rivers are the veins of our
planet, the veins of our ocean,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and they are currently
being clogged with plastic.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.100 align:middle line:84%
I do what I do because
I want my daughter

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and all the children
of the world to one day

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.960 align:middle line:90%
swim in a plastic-free ocean.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
I hope that by changing the way
we make and produce and consume

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.020 align:middle line:84%
products, we can switch
from a model that

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is destructive to a model
that is regenerative

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.480 align:middle line:90%
so that we can help our planet.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.146 align:middle line:90%
