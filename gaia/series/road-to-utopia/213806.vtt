00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So these Green School
kids are really

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
into making the world a
better place, tree by tree,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
plant by plant, ecosystem by
ecosystem, one drop of water

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.290 align:middle line:90%
after another.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.010 align:middle line:84%
It's really amazing and
remarkable that all of the Green

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.380 align:middle line:84%
School grads are really
committed to making

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:90%
the world a better place.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
>> Improving our education
system is not just about

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:90%
intangible benefits to society.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
For every dollar spent
on improving early child

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
development, the return
can be more than $8.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And this return-to-cost ratio
is highest in early childhood.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:84%
In my entrepreneurial
activities,

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I often meet people who study
through the Montessori method.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Montessori paved the way ahead
for many alternative education

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:90%
approaches.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.360 align:middle line:84%
And like a lot of
the big innovations

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that address
problems at the roots

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.990 align:middle line:84%
of how society functions,
Montessori has also

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
had to open people's minds
to an alternative approach

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:90%
to education.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Critique is inevitable when
we're changing the status quo.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And all alternative
education methods

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
have to deal with critique.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
On that note, I do not
think it is a coincidence

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that a relatively high
proportion of entrepreneurs

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:84%
went through education
systems like Montessori.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Doing things differently and
questioning our environments

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:90%
are key entrepreneurial skills.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And these methods usually
support a questioning

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.820 align:middle line:90%
perspective of the status quo.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.025 align:middle line:90%


00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Kids, from the time
they were very little,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:84%
are farming in the rice
fields at Green School.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.077 align:middle line:90%
They're planting vegetables.

00:09:50.077 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:10%
They're harvesting
the vegetables.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.980 align:middle line:90%
They've got a worm farm.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:90%
They're composting.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:90%
We have pigs on campus.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.990 align:middle line:90%
We have cows on campus.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:90%
The waste goes to the pigs.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.850 align:middle line:84%
The cows create compost
for the gardens.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.490 align:middle line:84%
There's a recycling
program where

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:09.550 align:middle line:84%
families bring in their plastic
and their glass and their metal.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And the kids are involved at
every level with all of this.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I think the teachers
at Green School

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.290 align:middle line:84%
are working closely
with the kids

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:84%
to enable the kids to create
this innate sense of curiosity

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.743 align:middle line:84%
about everything
that surrounds them,

00:10:23.743 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
everything that they're
up against, everything

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:90%
they're confronted with.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.818 align:middle line:84%
They have an extreme
sense of curiosity

00:10:29.818 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and don't just come
and judge things,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
but they're really
wanting to know

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
what is the nature of
what's in front of me

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.960 align:middle line:90%
and how could I dissect it?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> We came from a womb.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%
We lived in a cave.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
We didn't live in a box.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And Green School is matriarchal.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Green School is a womb, a
nest, a protective environment

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
with very little right
angle and materials

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that are so, so
friendly, and a tree

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:84%
going through the classroom
that moves sometimes and makes

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:90%
a noise.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:84%
So when you get into a
Green School classroom

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:84%
and you sit down at a desk,
which can be a straight row,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.830 align:middle line:84%
can be a crooked
row, can be an oval,

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
you start to control
your own environment.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
And it really changes how you
think about the future, how

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.865 align:middle line:90%
you think about life.

00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The school integrates
the local rituals,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.640 align:middle line:84%
insofar as one day a week, the
entire campus is wearing pakaian

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
adat, which is traditional
Balinese dress.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.120 align:middle line:90%
There's different rituals.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
At 2:00, there's a
gong that sounds.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what one is
doing, if in the middle--

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.313 align:middle line:84%
you're in the middle of
a conversation or writing

00:11:48.313 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:84%
something or you're in
the toilet or anywhere,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.756 align:middle line:84%
you stop for one minute and take
a moment of mindful meditation.

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:57.070 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Countries and families shape
our education at the root.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They imprint in us certain
ways of looking at the world.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:84%
In my own journey, I've
done a lot of questioning

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:90%
of these perspectives.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
If they are empowering
and rooted in love,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.760 align:middle line:84%
rooted in a caring
perspective of the world,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.790 align:middle line:84%
then I find that they
tend to be supportive of

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:90%
our personal evolution as well.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.900 align:middle line:84%
But if they come from
judgment and fear,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
I have learned that I do
better without having them

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:90%
in my default settings.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Taking perspectives
on the judgments

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that our cultures or families
have about the world is hard.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.870 align:middle line:84%
If we are immersed in a certain
culture environment where

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
everybody operates
in a certain way,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
we just don't know
anything else.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
That is why traveling
opens our minds.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
We suddenly realize that other
people live their reality

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.060 align:middle line:84%
in completely different ways and
through their own set of values.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Becoming aware of
that empowers us

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:84%
to understand that we can
choose those values too.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
So in a slightly more
micro way, the uniqueness

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.310 align:middle line:84%
of our country's culture
is also reflected

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.970 align:middle line:90%
in our family of origin.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:84%
When we are children,
the education

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.030 align:middle line:84%
we receive directly from our
parents has a lot of weight.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
As we start growing up,
we can see more clearly

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
how other people have
different perspectives built

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
into the way they
look at the world.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Noticing that can make
us question our beliefs.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
I find that these questioning
process starts clearly

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.970 align:middle line:84%
with the typical
teenage rebellion phase,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:84%
but it can then continue
in a healthy way as adults.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
We can always
challenge our judgments

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.470 align:middle line:90%
when they're not serving us.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We can replace actions
coming from fear with actions

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:90%
rooted in love and wisdom.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
That is ongoing self-education.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Green School, for us, was an
ability for us to demonstrate

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
our gratitude to Bali by
building something that was

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
so light on the land and
so phenomenally beautiful.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The Green School architecture
was influenced certainly by Bali

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.260 align:middle line:90%
and the culture of Bali.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to go and
tear down a mountain,

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
we didn't have to go
and dig up a hole,

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't have to go
and kill the last tree.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Green School architecture is
renewable and it's amazing.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I look at the
buildings 15 years on

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:84%
and the buildings are
still proud and strong.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be there as
long as we change the roof.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And after a few
years, we started

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.100 align:middle line:84%
to get local people choosing
to send their children to Green

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:90%
School.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:90%
But we had an incredible mix.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
We had kids from farms.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:90%
We had kids from villages.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We had an amazing group of kids.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And one day, a guy named Tim
Fijal came to me and said,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:90%
"John, we're not doing enough."

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And I went, "Tim, what do you
mean we're not doing enough?"

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
He said, "We're not doing
enough for the Balinese kids.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You've built all
these buildings which

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
are inhabited eight
or nine hours a day,

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:90%
245 days of the year.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:90%
What about the local kids?

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And so Tim started something
called the Kul Kul Connection.

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And it eventually
grew to a group

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.030 align:middle line:90%
of 300 kids came after school.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
The local school was on shift.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And they learned English,
environmentalism, and computer.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
these kids today,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:90%
they are completely different.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:84%
They had their regular school
and then they had Green School.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that happened
when Indonesia was on fire,

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
started to ask questions
about the smoke.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
They sold t-shirts,
they sold food,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and they got enough money to
fly to Irian Jaya and work with

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
activists there, asking the
question of their people,

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:84%
of their Indonesian people,
"Why are we burning the forest?"

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's like, wow, this
was-- for most of these kids,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
this was their first
time on a plane,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:84%
but they didn't go
to Disney World.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:84%
They went to Kalimantan
and asked questions that

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:90%
are really important questions.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:84%
"Why are we burning the
forest?" is a big thing.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I think if you're interested
in promoting educational

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.850 align:middle line:84%
sustainability in
your own communities,

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
it's important to be in
community and to know who

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:84%
your community is and speak
with a voice of the community.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And if that involves
going to the schools, who

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
is or isn't the
community because it's

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
a different kind
of union or group?

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I think the power of
community is something that's

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.260 align:middle line:84%
important and significant
and can be heard

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:90%
as long as it stands united.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I think what happens
in the long term

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.990 align:middle line:84%
with these kids, these young
adults who are becoming adults,

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
is that they have an
extremely powerful sense

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
of self-confidence and a desire
to make the world a better place

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.415 align:middle line:84%
and do that by their own
demonstrative living.

00:17:12.415 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Road to Utopia as a series
is all about opening our minds

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
to positive different ways of
building the kind of world we

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:84%
would actually be
excited to live in.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Education is at the core
of this because everything

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.500 align:middle line:84%
starts with the perspective
we look at the world through.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:37.300 align:middle line:84%
That perspective comes from
our environment, our families,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:90%
and our education systems.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.480 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones in charge
of expanding and updating

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.900 align:middle line:90%
our perspectives.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.810 align:middle line:90%
We have that power.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, as it turns out, the
current educational system

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
in Western society was
built through the Industrial

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Revolution, almost
200 years ago,

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
with a factory machine
approach designed

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:90%
to produce uniform units.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Same education, same tasks,
same model for everybody.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.850 align:middle line:84%
But the world we live in today
is so multifaceted and complex.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Diversity is more
than a birthright.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
It is also immensely
valuable to building

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.870 align:middle line:90%
a society we love living in.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I believe personalized
and experiential education

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
models like the Green
School are our future.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait to see more
education in this space.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that Green School
could go anywhere in the world

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:38.100 align:middle line:84%
where you've got a passionate
community of engaged learners,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.430 align:middle line:84%
students and parents that
want to make a community,

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that want to have an environment
where the kids are really

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.800 align:middle line:84%
engaged and really happy
and experiencing education

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.870 align:middle line:84%
in a really well-built
beautiful environment,

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.335 align:middle line:84%
not a traditional
institutional framework.

00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The Green School has
changed my life and changed

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.760 align:middle line:90%
my perspective.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I went from being a
pretty damaged individual

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:06.120 align:middle line:84%
from the school system to being
fully excited about education

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.710 align:middle line:84%
and fully excited
about the Green School.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.390 align:middle line:84%
It's producing
incredible results.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:84%
And we thought we'd have
to wait for 25 years,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:90%
but we didn't have to do that.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Our kids started doing things in
grade eight, grade seven, grade

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:90%
six that changed the world.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:10%
So it happened much more
quickly than I ever expected.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And it happened in a
very incredible way.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Green School produces
amazing human beings.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.160 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as we
have here in Bali,

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
we are committed to making a
difference and growing things.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The school was an interesting
growth opportunity just

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:84%
to plant a flagpole
on the land of Bali

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.960 align:middle line:84%
saying that this is a great
example of what might be.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't meant
to be the end all,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.890 align:middle line:84%
but it was meant to be
a catalyst for change

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
around the world with
holistic education.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about building
with local materials.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It's about building
sustainably, something beautiful

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and something that is serving
a need of a community.
