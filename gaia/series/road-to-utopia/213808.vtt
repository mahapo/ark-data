And I think the only way
these problems can be solved

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is if we raise
collective consciousness.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from
self-awareness,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%

and how many years

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.360 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we want
to focus on healthspan.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:84%
That is the number of years
we get to live well, making

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:90%
good use of our minds and body.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:84%
This gets us started
with holistic well-being

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.140 align:middle line:90%
and preventive health.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The Western healthcare
system was mostly

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
built on reactive
health, which means

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
responding to the
rise of health issues

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:84%

that prevents them from arising

We really have to understand
how everything is interlinked.

And if we don't understand
how everything is interlinked

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:10%
within our body, how
sleep affects how you eat

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:10%
and how it affects your mood,
and how exercise affects

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:10%

of these things are interlinked.

>> To come back to the longevity
of a single individual,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I do think there is definitely
potential for us to live longer.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:90%
The question is how.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about lifespan,
how long are we living,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
but how are we spending those
additional years of our life?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And here, we're talking
about healthspan.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to live another
20 years if those 20 years are

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:90%
going to be miserable.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:10%
We want to make sure that the
last years that we are living,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:10%
we are living with as
much health as possible,

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:10%
with as much
autonomy as possible.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of factors come
into that, not just medicine.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think it's also really
important to think about quality

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:90%
of life and healthspan.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
how many years

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:84%
you live if you're
not living the best

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.670 align:middle line:90%
quality of life in those years.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who wants to be
living till they're 100

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.660 align:middle line:84%
if you're spending the
last 20 years of your life

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.500 align:middle line:84%
with really chronic conditions
or not really able to move

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.910 align:middle line:84%
or not able to
function on your own?

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So yes, lifespan is
how many years can you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.440 align:middle line:84%
live, whereas healthspan
is how many years

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of quality, healthy
life can you live,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
which is more important
than lifespan.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
We want to extend your
life, but all of those years

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:84%
to be with full of
vitality and good health.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been fascinated by
Eastern medicine for years

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
and learned a lot of wisdom
that I have integrated

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.980 align:middle line:90%
into my day-to-day life.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
The preventive aspect
of Eastern traditions

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:90%
is what got me most interested.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
When I first came
across it, even just

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the idea of getting familiar
with the specific health

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
associations of our
organs was outlandish.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.110 align:middle line:84%
That is because I grew
up in an environment

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
where this was
never talked about.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And as we cover in
our education episode,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:84%
the culture we come from
shapes our perspectives.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
By now, I have benefited from
Eastern wisdom in many ways.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And the function
of our organs just

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:90%
seems like a starting point.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
When we dive into
holistic well-being,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:84%
there is a whole
universe to explore.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Companies like DRYM Health
are at the intersection

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of human performance and new
areas of holistic health.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
At the root of a holistic
approach to life is the way

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.130 align:middle line:90%
we care for ourselves.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.390 align:middle line:84%
I believe we can
better help others

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
if we first keep a healthy
relationship with ourselves.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.800 align:middle line:84%
This is why companies
covering mental health also

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
overlap with
longevity as a field.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Until a few years ago, mental
health was a taboo topic.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:84%
Ironically, this also comes
from collective shame,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
which, in itself, is an
emotion to understand

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
within mental health.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The more we expand our
emotional awareness

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.910 align:middle line:84%
in the day-to-day life, the more
we can show up authentically,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and that is a great starting
point for a long healthspan.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:90%
>> I was in psychology.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I was working in the NHS as a
Cognitive Behavioral Therapist

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.820 align:middle line:84%
and very quickly
excelled into management

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and supervising
other therapists.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Was even asked to do
a leadership course,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.260 align:middle line:84%
a six-month "Leading in the
Public Services" course.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And it was then that
I noticed that I've

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:90%
got more to offer here.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
I can have more of
an impact than I

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:84%
am in this kind of bureaucratic
environment that I was in.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Although I'm grateful for having
had the experience in the NHS

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.900 align:middle line:84%
and having made a difference
to so many people,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.733 align:middle line:84%
there are a lot of limitations
in the public services.

00:06:29.733 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I became the CEO of this
company at the age of 30,

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and it was one of the leading
companies in this niche market

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:90%
of personalized medicine.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But in this case,
we were dealing

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
with patients that were very
chronically and severely ill,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
cancer patients that were in
the last year of their life

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that needed a lot
of support at home.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:84%
And we were, basically,
a one-stop shop for this,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
combining a
multidisciplinary approach

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
with doctors, nutritionists,
pharmacists, and so on.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.240 align:middle line:84%
I always thought
it was a bit sad

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that we waited until
people got cancer

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.010 align:middle line:84%
to start dealing
with them in a very

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:90%
personalized and holistic way.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
firefighting way too late.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.940 align:middle line:84%
After 10 years, I felt like
it was the right time for me

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.760 align:middle line:84%
to change a chapter and
start something-- start

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.470 align:middle line:84%
something from
scratch because I love

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.040 align:middle line:90%
building things from scratch.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like bringing
this holistic approach

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
into a more preventative and
proactive form of health care,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:84%
where we're not waiting
for people to get severely

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
ill until we start doing
something about it.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what really drove us
to want to do something focused

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
on leaders and businesses and
fast-growth companies because we

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:84%
come from that background and
we've seen what it's like.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:10%
So we then decided
to start DRYM,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:10%
working with fast-moving,
fast-paced individuals,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:10%
helping them improve their
health and well-being

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.350 align:middle line:10%
holistically, so
we can, therefore,

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:14.100 align:middle line:10%
improve their performance
in a sustainable way.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Not for short-term performance,
but for long-term sustainable

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:19.630 align:middle line:90%
gains.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's where we
realized that we wanted to,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
one, do something together,
work with leaders,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
because, we felt that
working with people

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
who have the influence over
the rest of the company

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.390 align:middle line:90%
is really important.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.909 align:middle line:84%
>> When we zoom out and we
look at holistic well-being,

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
the work-life balance
crisis comes up.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.800 align:middle line:84%
On average, we spend
about half of our waking

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
hours at work during the
week in our lifetimes.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.290 align:middle line:84%
That is about 30% of
all our waking hours.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we make sure that we
spend all that work time well?

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.100 align:middle line:84%
There are many measures we can
take to improve our workdays,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.020 align:middle line:84%
but at the core of it lies
always the same question--

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
do we enjoy what we do?

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most satisfied
people I interact with

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.500 align:middle line:84%
say that their work
doesn't feel like work.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Isn't it sad that those
people are still the minority?

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So the question becomes,
how do we change that?

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> How are we expecting leaders
to understand how to change,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.300 align:middle line:84%
to create positive change
for the environment,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:84%
to reach our sustainable goals
without really understanding

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
this at a micro level
within their own organism?

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, the
aspect of sustainable growth

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
has to come down to,
really, people individually

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
understanding what does
sustainable growth mean

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
for them individually
and then expanding that

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
into the whole of society.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> We're constantly distracted.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not even
aware of what we're

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.390 align:middle line:84%
doing to the environment,
what we're doing to our teams.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Especially for
leaders, when you're

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.640 align:middle line:84%
stressed out all the time, those
hormones are leaking out of you.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:90%
Your team will feel that stress.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> And the language of numbers
to really make them understand

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
that the way that they are
leading their companies,

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.810 align:middle line:84%
that is the same way they
should be leading their lives.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.310 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
no reason why you

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
should have a whole
dashboard of KPIs which

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is tracking whether your company
is going in the right direction,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
while you shouldn't have
that dashboard of KPIs

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:90%
for your personal health.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many parts of
our culture that we are only

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.070 align:middle line:90%
starting to question now.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
The UK recently tested a
four-day workweek across 60

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
companies with about 3,000
employees for six weeks,

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and the results were incredible.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:84%
92% of those companies chose
to continue the experiment.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Their staff was more motivated
and their productivity

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.970 align:middle line:90%
did not decrease.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, one-third
of those companies

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.196 align:middle line:84%
chose to adopt a four-day
workweek permanently.

00:11:12.196 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:10%
>> We apply a three-step process
in our methodology-- test,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:10%
track, and transform.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
During the testing phase,
it's really important

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.440 align:middle line:84%
to establish a baseline
of where you are now.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
So before you start implementing
all of these changes,

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.790 align:middle line:84%
we want to see what is
your starting place.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we
use different tests.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
comprehensive blood test

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
which looks at key markers
for health but also longevity.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And although there's
standards of how we deal with

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
these things, understanding
the human body,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.930 align:middle line:84%
the individual in
a better layer,

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.870 align:middle line:84%
and then developing targeted
therapies for that person is

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
going to lead to
better outcomes.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we try to do,
again, from a proactive and

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.930 align:middle line:84%
preventative approach,
is that we say,

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's start
really understanding

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:90%
your body from now.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's a very exciting
space because researchers are

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.420 align:middle line:84%
developing more and
more biomarkers for--

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
the more these are
developed, the more

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
we can implement them
into our testing kit.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.690 align:middle line:84%
But we also tested a
range of other things,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:90%
such as gut test, hormone tests.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:32.300 align:middle line:10%
And getting this baseline
of someone's current state

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.310 align:middle line:10%
of health gives us
a very good view

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:10%
of which areas do they
really need to improve on

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.540 align:middle line:10%
and which ones will
have the most impact.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is also
known as Medicine 3.0.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:53.210 align:middle line:84%
A very big part of Medicine 3.0
is personalization as well as

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:84%
tracking data
because we can only

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
understand what works for
one person and not the other

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:84%
if we are measuring what
is working overtime.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the data,
not from a perspective

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%
of what you find today.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
If you go today to your GP,
they will do your bloods,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and if everything is
not in the normal range,

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:90%
you will be sent home.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
But they will only
do something with you

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
once you are outside of
the normal range, where

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.530 align:middle line:84%
then, already, we start
with prescribing medication.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to look at,
within the normal range, what

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:90%
is optimal.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you are this close
to not being in the normal,

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:84%
maybe we should be doing
something about that before.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, we can predict,
based on the fact you're a man

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:84%
or a woman, of a certain
size and a certain age,

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
what you should be able
to get this score up to.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.010 align:middle line:84%
The trend is such that as we get
older, human beings get older,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.404 align:middle line:84%
the score is
supposed to go down.

00:13:50.404 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So effectively, by
exceeding whatever

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:84%
your age-predicted score
is, essentially, you're

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.350 align:middle line:84%
keeping your body in a state
that a younger person would be.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You're aging slower.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you're preventing your
body from slipping into it like

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:90%
an older-age condition.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
This is really the
key, is that what we do

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.220 align:middle line:84%
is we build up what we
call functional capacity.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And because human beings
are aerobic organisms that

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
use oxygen to burn their
fuel, to make their energy

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.632 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do their function
or their exercise or activity,

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
if we're able to achieve higher
rates of oxygen consumption

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:84%
during activity, this tells us
that our functional capacity

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is greater than
it's supposed to be.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And as we get older,
this functional capacity

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to decrease.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So if we maintain it
at a higher level,

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
essentially, we're, yes,
preventing the effects of aging

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
or keeping them at bay.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's something that you
track over time because instead

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
of just counting the years
that you are on this Earth,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
we're counting, over time,
what is my VO2 max today,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
what is it in five years,
and how is that progressing?

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And then evaluating
how fast are we aging.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we do then is we can
use this information that we

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.780 align:middle line:84%
derived from the test to start
giving them better advice about

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:84%
their exercise, to make it
appropriate and effective

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.040 align:middle line:84%
for them so that
they can, in fact,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.400 align:middle line:84%
improve this score over time
and improve their chances

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:90%
of longevity.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What I am personally
fascinated by is how we are

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
gradually discovering through
science what was already known

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.260 align:middle line:84%
in many Indigenous cultures
for a very long time.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It has made me
explore the wisdom.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think there is
no bottom to that well.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
The most helpful
distinction I have learned

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
is the distinction between
experiential wisdom

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
and intellectual wisdom.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Intellectual wisdom is when
our mind understands a concept.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Experiential wisdom is
when we have experienced

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
that concept ourselves so we
understand it much more deeply.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, the Buddha
himself discovered

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:84%
through meditation aspects
of modern physics and biology

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that we know today
through science.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It was experiential
understanding

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.170 align:middle line:90%
which he translated into words.

[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we make sure that the
data is not making people sicker

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.280 align:middle line:84%
but is actually making people
understand their bodies more

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and tune into their bodies
and develop that intuition?

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Sleep, nutrition,
movement, and mind.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.480 align:middle line:90%
It's a cycle.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
The way we think impacts the
way we feel physically and vice

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.850 align:middle line:90%
versa.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If we're then noticing
that our body is anxious,

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.600 align:middle line:84%
we've got butterflies,
we feel tense,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
that then impacts the way
we think about the situation

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a bit
of a vicious cycle.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
So I think it is so important to
just stop, be present, and sit

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.750 align:middle line:84%
with your feelings,
sit with your body.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

>> We see it in the work
that we do with our clients,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.619 align:middle line:84%
that even though the data gives
us so much of a framework to be

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.849 align:middle line:84%
making the right decisions, it's
also important to understand

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.630 align:middle line:84%
when data is too much and when
you should be taking devices

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.510 align:middle line:84%

as a field is that it brings

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.960 align:middle line:84%
so many different
disciplines together.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:84%
We can look at it from a science
angle, from a tech perspective,

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:84%
or from a practitioner
viewpoint.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.320 align:middle line:84%
The cutting edge of the

becomes about empowering
ourselves to explore

the modalities and the
areas of wisdom that

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:90%
resonate the most with us.

Our bodies and minds are
entire universes of their own,

we're trying to achieve.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.758 align:middle line:84%
We want to have that aha
moment where a leader really

00:18:47.758 --> 00:18:49.300 align:middle line:84%
comes to the point
that they're like,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is not just
about my well-being.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%

The way I am dealing with
the team is in a better way.

leader to deal with stress,

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:09.730 align:middle line:84%
which really is affected by all
of these aspects that we work

with-- sleep, nutrition,
exercise, mind--

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
is so important with regards
to the level of the stress

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:18.390 align:middle line:90%
that the team feels.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
big part of what

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.610 align:middle line:84%
we do at DRYM and a very big
part of where I see medicine,
