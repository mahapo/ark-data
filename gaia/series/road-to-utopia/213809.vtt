>> Our life and life on this
planet and in the universe,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.950 align:middle line:84%
it's a continuous transformation
from one form of energy

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

Electric thermal light.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The word "energy" comes from an
ancient Greek word, "energeia,"

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.790 align:middle line:90%
which means "force in action."

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Fusion energy checks
all the boxes.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:90%
It's the perfect energy source.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy is everything.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:84%
We know from physics
that no material object

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:90%
is standing still.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Some of us also know
from our own experience

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.750 align:middle line:84%
how energy moves through the
body and across the world.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes to
energy consumption,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:90%
everything is at stake.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:84%
Geopolitics, wars and peace,
pollution versus sustainability.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.930 align:middle line:84%
We can even assess
our level of evolution

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
as an advanced
civilization based

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:90%
on how we can harness energy.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a theory
called Kardashev scale

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:90%
that looks at this.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.570 align:middle line:90%
It has six levels.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And at the first
level, a civilization

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:84%
is capable of using the energy
from everything on its planet.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
This also includes the energy
coming from the planet's star.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
In our case, that
star is the sun.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
So at this level one, we
stop extracting minerals

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.470 align:middle line:84%
from inside the Earth and we
become ecologically friendly.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:84%
At level two, we can
leverage all the energy

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.040 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And at level three,
we leverage the energy

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of the planet's galaxy.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.760 align:middle line:90%
In our case, of the Milky Way.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Let's keep in mind
that all of the above

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
happens in a circular way, not
in an extractive or harmful way.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Level one already
is a civilization

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.970 align:middle line:90%
with energy abundance.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
What I like about this framework
is the magnitude of it.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:90%
We are not even a level one.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we're
zooming into fusion energy

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.030 align:middle line:84%
through the story
of Francesco Volpe,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
a founder passionate
about magnetic fusion who

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.665 align:middle line:84%
has made big discoveries
within fusion energy.

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I always wanted to do
something related with science

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
or engineering and at the
same time do something good

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.790 align:middle line:90%
for society.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%
I also liked arts.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I always cultivated
these two interests.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But at the age of 16, I
fell in love for physics,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.600 align:middle line:84%
in general, and for
fusion, in particular.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
I read a very inspiring
book by Amaldi,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%
who was a disciple of Fermi.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:10%
I was fascinated
by modern physics.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:10%
In that book, I still
remember the three pages

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to fusion.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Those sparked a light.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
More than an idea, in the
sense of an invention.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
It was a discovery.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
No stellarator
startup existed yet

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and no fusion startup
existed in Europe yet.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to fill both gaps
for startup or magnetic fusion

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
startup in Europe,
first stellarator

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
startup in the world,
and take advantage

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
of this environment more
suitable for these high risk

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.695 align:middle line:90%
but very high reward idea.

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
On this planet, fusion is
the ultimate energy source.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Fusion was considered at the
border of science fiction

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.570 align:middle line:90%
a few decades ago.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Fusion, after all, was
proven in a lab in the 20s.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
It is not as far-fetched as
these science fiction stories

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.790 align:middle line:90%
or matter-antimatter energy.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.930 align:middle line:10%
The newest form of energy
fusion is at the same time also

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:10%
the most ancient, the most
primordial form of energy

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:10%
in the universe that has powered
it nearly since its inception.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a huge endeavor,
but we are making it.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.340 align:middle line:84%
The source of energy
of the universe

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:84%
will make life here on Earth
easier and more sustainable.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are all the forms
of energy production that could

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
start making a big
difference today?

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Renewables like solar
and wind only go as far.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000 align:middle line:84%
They require a significant
use of raw materials

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
for their creation and they only
last for a limited time span.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to forms of
energy, such as geothermal,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
nuclear, hydrogen, and
fusion, the improvements

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.890 align:middle line:84%
in eliminating pollution
and resource usage

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
can be exponential.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Geothermal energy is heat
energy from the Earth.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
It comes from reservoirs of
hot water below the ground.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
There is an exciting trend
across all forms of energy

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
in this episode,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is the shrinking in
size and democratized access

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to these forms of energy.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
geothermal energy,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
low-temperature
geothermal heat can

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
be found in many
parts of the world,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
making it more broadly available
than traditional geothermal.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Companies like Kleiman have
pioneered the move away

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
from the large centralized
plants that have

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.390 align:middle line:90%
to dig deep into the ground.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they are providing
decentralized heat power

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
generation at low
temperatures, which

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.550 align:middle line:84%
makes it widely available
like solar and wind.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes
to fusion energy,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Francesco and the team
at Renaissance Fusion

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:84%
have been developing a machine
that they call the stellarator.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It can recreate the same
process that fuels the sun.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
It is like a mini-sun
available here on Earth.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Fusion is different and
better than traditional nuclear

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:90%
fission reactions.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Fusion is the energy source, the
Holy Grail of energy, as we say.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
It is such a huge
opportunity for mankind,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
for the economy, that
it should be explored

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and everybody, private
and public, in any country

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.010 align:middle line:90%
should pursue that.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:90%
How much should we care?

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Some detractors of
fusion say let's focus

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.090 align:middle line:84%
on solutions ready now
to address the climate

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:90%
emergency now.

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Fusion is 30 years away
and always will be.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:10%
You can't imagine how fed up
I am of this joke of fusion

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.380 align:middle line:10%
being 30 years away,
perennially being 30 years away.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:10%
My mission, career-wise,
and the mission

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:10%
of Renaissance Fusion and
the Fusion Startup Movement

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:10%
is to disprove this joke.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.690 align:middle line:90%
We are not 30 years away.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:84%
We are 10 years away, and
the world should care.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:84%
For a fraction, tiny
fraction, of the energy costs

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in terms of operation and R&D
costs on other forms of energy,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:84%
for a tiny fraction
of that, we could

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
seize the power of the stars,
so we should really do it.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We are in a fusion lab, in
a commercial fusion lab,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:84%
so we are realizing fusion
in the following way.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We create the fourth
state of matter.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
So like the ancient earth,
water, air, and fire.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
So solid, liquid,
gas, and plasma.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.600 align:middle line:84%
The fourth state of
matter, ionized gas,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.510 align:middle line:90%
you have to make this plasma.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
And for fusion, since this
plasma is made of particles

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and you want this particle
to collide and fuse,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:84%
you want them to
collide at high energy.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:84%
This is obtained by bringing
that gas to high temperature.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And also, you want
many reactions,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:84%
therefore, you want
many particles,

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
therefore, you
want high density.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So fusion consists
in taking a gas,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.470 align:middle line:84%
separating the nuclei
from the electrons.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Now you have this soup,
this primordial soup

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:90%
of ions and electrons.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
There are several
ways of doing that.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.396 align:middle line:84%
We are developing
some prototypes.

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:10%
In magnetic fusion, you keep
these particles away from

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:10%
the walls of the container
because, otherwise,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:10%
you cannot make
hotter than the sun.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we make
this ionized gas.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We bring it to sufficiently
high density and temperature.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And we want the energy produced
by the fusion reactions

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.370 align:middle line:84%
to stay in the
plasma long enough

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the plasma
hot and, therefore, foster

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:90%
other reactions.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like when
you start a fire with a match.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
If there is a lot
of wind blowing,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:17.660 align:middle line:84%
the heat that you are
injecting to create this flame

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.950 align:middle line:84%
is transported away and your
wood doesn't quite burn.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
We build new magnets,
revolutionary magnets,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.750 align:middle line:84%
to decouple the physics
from the engineering.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
The physics is
inevitably complex.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
This plasma has a shape
which is inevitably complex,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.690 align:middle line:90%
dictated by some equations.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.890 align:middle line:84%
But the engineering of how to
generate this magnetic field,

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
basically, the design of
the magnets, can be simple.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Some simple magnets can generate
very complex magnetic fields.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
In a conventional
stellarator, you

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
need magnets looking like
three-dimensional sculptures,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.050 align:middle line:90%
rings but highly deformed rings.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:84%
We replace
three-dimensional sculptures

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.080 align:middle line:84%
with painting, a painting
where the brush is a laser

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and the canvas is
a superconductor.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.240 align:middle line:84%
We make cylinders,
cylindrical canvas

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.110 align:middle line:84%
coated with superconductor
in our machines.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The subject of fusion
was declassified in 1957.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And from 1957, all
countries worldwide

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:84%
have collaborated on the
peaceful utilization of fusion

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to indeed produce energy.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
That is the official birthday of
fusion energy for peaceful uses.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:10%
We are at this crucial
moment and standing

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:10%
on the shoulders of giants.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.575 align:middle line:10%
It's a big, big endeavor.

00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:90%
>> How about nuclear energy?

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
A few decades ago,
this industry was

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:84%
seen as a great promise
for green consumption.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:84%
The accidents that
happened in the US,

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in Chernobyl, and then
in Japan gave rise

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to public protests on one side
and to lobbying against it

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
by competitive industries
on the other side.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.390 align:middle line:84%
If you compare nuclear to coal,
the coal industry causes 15,000

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
direct deaths every year and
millions of indirect ones.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In four decades, traditional
nuclear energy has caused

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
a total of less than
5,000 direct deaths.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Even considering this, we
can't ignore the dangers

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of radioactive nuclear waste.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is where innovation,
such as more modular reactors,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.490 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to come in.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Small modular reactors are
advanced nuclear reactors

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
with about one-third
of the generating

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
capacity of traditional
nuclear power reactors.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Studies are showing that these
reactors could exponentially

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
increase the volume of
short-lived, low-level waste, as

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
opposed to more harmful waste,
but that is still a theory.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Small modular reactors
are facing issues

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.870 align:middle line:90%
around cost and scalability.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>> In traditional nuclear,
in conventional nuclear,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.310 align:middle line:84%
we start with uranium or other
heavy nuclei and we split them

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:90%
into smaller ones.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Fusion consists in taking
light nuclei like hydrogen,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.640 align:middle line:84%
for example, and fusing these
light nuclei into heavier ones.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, both in the case of fission
and in the case of fusion,

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:84%
if you take the mass
of the reactants

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and the mass of
the products, you

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:84%
will notice that there
is a deficit of mass.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Some mass has been lost.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.740 align:middle line:84%
The products are lighter
than the reactants.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So according to the
famous equation,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.490 align:middle line:84%
energy equals mass times
speed velocity squared,

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:90%
by Einstein, mass is energy.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
That deficit in mass results
in a surplus in energy.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
In this reaction, some mass
has been converted in energy.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:10%
And because the velocity of
light is a very high number,

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:10%
a small deficit in mass results
in a huge amount of energy.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:10%
So it is an extremely
efficient source of energy.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Very small amounts
of fuel result

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
in large amounts of energy,
even more than fusion.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The energy density,
as we say, basically,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
how much density per unit
mass of the fuel of fusion,

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
is the highest of all
energy sources, by far,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.090 align:middle line:90%
by orders of magnitude.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.530 align:middle line:84%
This makes it very attractive,
combined with the fact

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
that the fuel is very abundant.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And it can be derived
indirectly from lithium.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:84%
It has a small
footprint, unlike,

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:90%
for example, solar or wind.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It needs small amounts of
land to generate energy.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:10%
All these aspects,
plus, of course,

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.400 align:middle line:10%
the fact that it doesn't produce
any carbon dioxide and the fact

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:10%
that it is not intermittent,
unlike the sun or the wind,

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:10%
all these factors
combined together

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.840 align:middle line:10%
led to calling fusion
the Holy Grail of energy.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Fusion can go very far but
is something happening soon.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:90%
One question is how soon?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:90%
How can we make it quicker?

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Can we make it quick
enough, for example,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.660 align:middle line:84%
to contribute to
fighting climate change?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a major question.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
schools of thought.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask me and other
enthusiasts about fusion,

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:84%
it will contribute very
soon, in a few years, again,

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.270 align:middle line:84%
a decade or so,
combating climate change.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the 2030s, a large
fraction of the world population

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.120 align:middle line:84%
will live in metropolitan
areas or in megalopolis.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:90%
There is a tendency to that.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.120 align:middle line:84%
I believe the statistics are of
the order of 70% of the world

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.690 align:middle line:84%
population, in the late 2030s,
will live in these large

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.780 align:middle line:90%
metropolitan areas.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
These large areas need
these large power plants,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
whatever the energy source,
but they will need gigawatts.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You cannot ask the sun to shine
brighter or the wind to blow

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:90%
stronger.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
We need additional
energy sources.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Fusion is ideally
suited to address that.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Can fusion power
a small community?

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Can fusion power a ship?

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Can fusion power an
airplane or a car?

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Each of these objectives
is more and more ambitious.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Maritime transportation
can definitely

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:84%
be decarbonized by fusion after,
again, power plants on land

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.090 align:middle line:90%
will be demonstrated.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> How are we going to produce
truly green energy for everyone

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.610 align:middle line:84%
and change the dynamics of
an industry that has caused

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:44.180 align:middle line:84%
suffering all across history,
especially during these times?

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Nuclear fusion has the potential
to produce four million times

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%
more energy than fossil fuels.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Most experts say that
we are unlikely to be

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
able to generate large-scale
energy from nuclear fusion

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:90%
before 2050.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I say that talking about
2050 today is nonsense.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We can't make
accurate predictions

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.140 align:middle line:90%
on such a long-term scale.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.823 align:middle line:90%
We don't have that time anyway.

00:16:07.823 --> 00:16:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>> If we think of the
history of aviation,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.960 align:middle line:84%
if we think of
hydroelectric power,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.830 align:middle line:84%
one of the birthplaces of
which, by the way, is Grenoble.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
If we think of the
birth of nuclear power,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:84%
in all these major inflection
points in human history,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
there is a zeitgeist, there
is a spirit of the time.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We are close to the
Kitty Hawk moment.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Today, someone will be
the next Wright brothers.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And a couple of decades
afterwards, some company

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
will be the next
Boeing or Airbus.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like when nuclear
energy, fission

00:16:55.710 --> 00:17:01.240 align:middle line:84%
energy was discovered and
demonstrated for peaceful uses.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It was in the air.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Various groups in various
countries were working on it.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.690 align:middle line:90%
It was not a question of "if."

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It was a question on "when"
and "who" and "how" exactly,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
but the basic
principles were there.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.420 align:middle line:84%
We are at this crucial
moment in history.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:21.000 align:middle line:90%
The principles are there.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:90%
It will happen.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a question of who is going
to make it and how exactly.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And not necessarily it
will be a single invention,

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:84%
just like we have
airplanes and helicopters

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:36.040 align:middle line:84%
or just like we have different
types of fusion reactors

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
or vapor pressure machine
in the Industrial Revolution

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:84%
I can continue with
other analogies.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:84%
These crucial moments incarnate,
embody into two, three,

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
four different
inventions, all equally

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.670 align:middle line:84%
transformational
and complementary.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The enthusiasm of the fusion
community, especially the fusion

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.350 align:middle line:84%
startup community,
the advances that it

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is doing few months,
sometimes, whereas

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in some other
organizations, often,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.710 align:middle line:84%
it took years and
10 times the budget,

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
is paving the way to this
crucial inflection point.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So I have not the
slightest doubt

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that we are at the
verge of this moment.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And we are so close
that fusion, in itself,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
would be already super
futuristic, is the future coming

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.820 align:middle line:84%
to the present, is a future that
somebody thought to be too far,

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.410 align:middle line:84%
science fiction, indeed,
and instead, realizing it

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.150 align:middle line:90%
in a decade.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
That's already a
huge price for me.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:90%


00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that the innovation
we need in today's world comes

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.450 align:middle line:84%
through unique states of
mind and at the intersection

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:54.280 align:middle line:90%
of different sectors.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
This is why we cover a wide
range of positive innovation

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.400 align:middle line:90%
through Road to Utopia.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.960 align:middle line:84%
This is an invitation
to think differently.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So what does divergent
thinking look like?

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.750 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
quotes by Albert Einstein

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
has him saying that the
medicine of the future

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:90%
will be frequency medicine.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Nobody was talking about this
concept publicly at his time

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:90%
and nobody does today either.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:90%
But Einstein was a polymath.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
He also surrendered
to how little we grasp

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:90%
about how the universe works.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
He brought together
different fields

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and tapped into
powerful states of mind.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to be Einstein
to have a curious mind.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.110 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
entrepreneurs like Francesco

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.730 align:middle line:84%
advancing the way we
understand energy.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.180 align:middle line:84%
We can approach it as a
scientist, as an activist,

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
as a designer, as an
artist, or as someone

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
who is keen to join
sustainable companies that

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.410 align:middle line:90%
are part of the solution.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Something is in the air.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
You can feel when the
invention is coming.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You can feel it is possible.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
It is an entire movement,
an entire society,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.510 align:middle line:84%
a workforce of scientists,
engineers working on it.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
A society ready to use that
invention or that discovery.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:84%
It's only a question of how
precisely that thing which

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.420 align:middle line:90%
is in the air will materialize.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Today, with fusion, we
are not at the drawings

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.030 align:middle line:90%
of Leonardo of how to fly.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:84%
The newest form of energy
is at the same time

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.860 align:middle line:84%
the most ancient form of energy
in the universe that has powered

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:90%
it nearly since its inception.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And now we are realizing it
on Earth for the greater good,

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
for a sustainable energy
future for generations to come,

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.325 align:middle line:90%
for millions of years to come.
