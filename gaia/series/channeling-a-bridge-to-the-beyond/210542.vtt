00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1969, people all
around the world were staring

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.095 align:middle line:84%
at the television to see
if man would actually walk

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:90%
on the surface of the moon.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
The floodgates opened for
science fiction fantasies,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and more humans started
to believe that life out

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.060 align:middle line:90%
there was actually possible.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
The search for any evidence
of life beyond Earth

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:90%
began growing rapidly.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.260 align:middle line:84%
UFO sightings were
becoming more common,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and mysterious
government programs

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
were being created to study
the unidentified flying

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:90%
objects seen by so many.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Along with these strange
events in the sky,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
more channels began opening,
bringing powerful messages

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
from other star systems.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:10%
>> As the first
contact specialist,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.070 align:middle line:10%
one of the techniques that is
common to my kind is to always

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:10%
experience a life in the
civilization we are eventually

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.610 align:middle line:10%
going to contact so
we will understand it.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.520 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way we would be
able to have a translation that

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.330 align:middle line:90%
makes sense to you.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:84%
It's got to come through someone
in your civilization that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
is a representation of some
extension of our over soul

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
so that we can draw
upon that information

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.435 align:middle line:84%
and those experiences
to allow our information

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:90%
to make sense to you.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we would be
too alien to each other.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:10%
When someone begins to learn to
channel in the way that I do,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm not really sure it's all
that important to differentiate

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:10%
who it is you're connecting to.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:84%
As long as you are staying
in a positive state,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:84%
you know you're bringing
something through

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to help people, what difference
does it really make at first?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:90%
It could be a spirit guide.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
It could be another
dimensional being.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It could be your
own higher mind.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
It could be another aspect
of your own consciousness.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
The point is not really so
much to focus on who it is

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:90%
but what's coming through.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Is what's coming through
positive, constructive,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:84%
helpful, or is it controlling,
ego-driven, or something

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:84%
like that, which is usually the
channel's own issues getting

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
in the way and filtering
the information.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:90%
But that's OK.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It takes practice to
learn the difference,

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and that's actually
the way it unfolds

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
is when you get more
practiced at it,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
if it's important for you to
know where that's coming from,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.040 align:middle line:84%
you will usually figure it
out or it will tell you.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:10%
>> When you look at channelers
from around the world and even

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:10%
in our study, many of them
believe that the sources are

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.530 align:middle line:10%
not from Earth, that they're
what they call offworld ally

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:10%
or extraterrestrial
intelligences.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:10%
And the story is that these
beings are beneficent beings

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:10%
who really want to help
humanity in this incredibly

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:10%
pivotal transitional
time, and that what

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.430 align:middle line:10%
we're going through right now is
actually this push to awakening

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:10%
and enlightenment for humanity.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And you see this
over and over again.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
in these sessions,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
hearing all this
information, all this content

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.940 align:middle line:84%
about these offworld
allies, I think

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.560 align:middle line:84%
it's very arrogant to think that
we're alone in this universe.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.855 align:middle line:84%
And so, personally, I
leave space for the reality

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:50.330 align:middle line:90%
that that could be true.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that a spaceship

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
is going to show up on
the White House lawn

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.875 align:middle line:84%
and shake hands
with the president.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] If there are offworld
allies really out there,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
that they're smart
enough to know that that

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:90%
would create a crazy frenzy.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you hear
many, many anecdotes

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:84%
about people who
are having contact

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.410 align:middle line:84%
experiences in a variety
of different ways

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.180 align:middle line:90%
around the planet.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:10%
And maybe if it is
going to happen,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:10%
it will be this
bottom-up grassroots wave

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:10%
of transformation
where people just

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.300 align:middle line:10%
then accept we're
not alone, and here's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.862 align:middle line:10%
how it's showing up for us.

00:04:35.862 --> 00:04:40.690 align:middle line:10%
>> In the 1960s, while attending
the University of Louisville

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:10%
in Kentucky, Carla L. Rueckert
joined an experimental

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.950 align:middle line:10%
channeling group that was
being led by physics professor

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.090 align:middle line:10%
and paranormal
researcher Don Elkins.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
In the early 1970s,
she partnered with Don

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to form LL Company
which eventually became

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
LL Research dedicated
to further their studies

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.440 align:middle line:90%
into paranormal activity.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:10%
In December of 1980,
researcher Jim McCarty

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:10%
joined forces with
Carla and Don.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.040 align:middle line:10%
Three weeks later,
the Ra contact began.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.635 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I am Ra.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:35.240 align:middle line:84%
I have not spoken
through this instrument.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We had to wait until she
was precisely tuned as we

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:90%
send a narrow band vibration.

00:05:51.140 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
We greet you and the
love and in the light

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:90%
of our infinite creator.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:10%
>> The Law of One or the Ra
material is a channel text that

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:10%
came through in the early 1980s
from a group of UFO researchers

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.350 align:middle line:10%
who had been spending the
better part of over a decade

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:10%
researching the phenomenon of
UFOs and extraterrestrials,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:10%
which at that time
was very active.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And this group of
about 12 people

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:84%
somehow came to the
conclusion, very rightly,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.450 align:middle line:84%
that if we want to really know
or understand these beings that

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
are appearing on
our planet, we need

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.710 align:middle line:84%
to be more interested
in their philosophy

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and their spirituality
than their science

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and their technology.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And so Don Elkins
came up with the idea

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.280 align:middle line:84%
of using the art of channeling
as a means of communication,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:84%
that these beings,
whatever they are,

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
they must be able to
communicate through thought.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was many,
many years later

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.470 align:middle line:84%
after working with Don Elkins
and Jim McCarty in this group

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
that she was actually trying
to help teach a student how

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.565 align:middle line:90%
to channel one evening.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.940 align:middle line:84%
And while she was teaching
how to get into the channeling

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.820 align:middle line:90%
state, a contact came through.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And it identified
itself as a being

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.090 align:middle line:84%
named Ra of a sixth density
social memory complex

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:84%
to which they didn't really
have an understanding of what

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.896 align:middle line:90%
that meant at the time.

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I greet you in the love
and the light of our infinite

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:90%
creator.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I am with this mind,
body, spirit complex,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:84%
which has offered
itself for a channel.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:10%
I communicate with you.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So over the course
of the next four years,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:04.550 align:middle line:84%
from 1981 to 1984, they began
doing 106 sessions over that

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.420 align:middle line:84%
time period of the Ra material,
channeling this entity named

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Ra, in a question
and answer format.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And this was one of the
imperatives of this channeling

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
work was that this entity
said we are beings who

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
honor free will, so we're not
here to just preach to you

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and just give you information.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:84%
But we want to have
a dialogue with you.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.860 align:middle line:90%
So you can question us.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we deem it's not a
violation of your free will

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.000 align:middle line:84%
to know something, we'll
give you our answer.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.809 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going to speak
with you in any other format.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:38.750 align:middle line:10%
And this was a really important
part of the Law of One material

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.480 align:middle line:10%
because Don,
essentially, takes Ra

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.430 align:middle line:10%
through a series of over 2,000
question and answer of what

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:10%
is the nature of
the universe, what

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.970 align:middle line:10%
is the nature of the
soul's evolution,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:54.650 align:middle line:10%
reincarnation, the metaphysics
of energy, and so forth.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:58.232 align:middle line:84%
And Ra gives the
most profound answers

00:08:58.232 --> 00:09:00.440 align:middle line:84%
that I believe has ever come
through a channeled work

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.365 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And so that's really what
allows, I think, the Law of One

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to stand apart from
all other channel texts

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is that it was done
in this group format

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:84%
that Ra says also just having
other people there also

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.954 align:middle line:84%
brought in more strength for the
contact itself to come through.

00:09:16.954 --> 00:09:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> --of a reception of our being
is a somewhat more advanced

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
feat than some of the more
broad vibration channels opened

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:40.160 align:middle line:84%
by other members for more
introductory and intermediate

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.075 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>> When we get into channeling
beings of higher densities,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
the process of channeling
becomes very nuanced

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and delicate, because depending
on the level of density

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:84%
of the entity we're contacting,
it requires different degrees

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:90%
of lucidity or trance, perhaps.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.590 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, beings
of higher densities,

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
like sixth density,
require a very narrow band

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.920 align:middle line:84%
of channeling that requires one
to really be in a trance state.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is the
state Carla had to be

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.360 align:middle line:10%
in for the Law of One sessions.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.210 align:middle line:10%
Whereas, a lower density
being like a fourth density

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:10%
entity, which is people who can
channel while they're on stage

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:10%
giving a talk, they can
connect with those beings,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:10%
because really in
a non-trance state,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:10%
we're receiving information
intuitively, feeling

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:10%
impressions and information
that we can condense

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.050 align:middle line:10%
through our own language.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of a
relationship between the entity

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.220 align:middle line:84%
being channeled and the
channeler in that the entity is

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:84%
allowing the channeler to
paraphrase for them what

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
the essence of what
they're trying to say,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.740 align:middle line:84%
but it isn't necessarily a
word-for-word communication.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.728 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.728 --> 00:10:57.570 align:middle line:10%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
My whole body behaves like
if I am the same vibration,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.970 align:middle line:90%
the same frequency.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:90%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:10%
Feels like if I am a radio
that can change the frequencies

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:21.510 align:middle line:10%
and choose which
frequency to expand.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they
really are inside,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and it feels really different.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's really tiring
when that happens

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.130 align:middle line:84%
because it takes
a lot of strength

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.800 align:middle line:84%
for you to use your
chakras and you

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
have to relocate all the energy
of yourself with other ones.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.920 align:middle line:84%
So that's very tiring
and exhausting.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But most of the times, it's
just, like, frequencies.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's not tiring.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.772 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
letting it go through.

00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:59.990 align:middle line:10%
>> In the early 1990s, Barbara
Marciniak released her powerful

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:03.620 align:middle line:10%
book "Bringers of the Dawn."

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:10%
This incredible
work was compiled

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:10%
using her channeled messages
from a group of beings

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.296 align:middle line:10%
known as the Pleiadians.

00:12:12.296 --> 00:12:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I think most important--
and this is what the Pleiadians

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.730 align:middle line:10%
have taught me over the
years, and the Pleiadians are,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:10%
of course, the entities or
energies that I channel--

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.580 align:middle line:10%
that we have to really
make peace with our self,

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:10%
our physical form, and
the consciousness that

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.030 align:middle line:10%
occupies that physical form.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:10%
So bottom line, they
always say, number one,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.910 align:middle line:10%
in order to go forward,
you have to love yourself.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:10%
>> I think Barbara Marciniak
is one of our premiere oracles

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.690 align:middle line:10%
on the planet and
thank goddess for her.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Her work "Bringers
of the Dawn" meant

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
so much to people,
and that concept,

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
that Pleiadian
concept of the Earth

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:84%
as the living library of DNA
and beings and is precious.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
So I'm very grateful for her.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.450 align:middle line:10%
>> And as the
Pleiadians would say,

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.380 align:middle line:10%
you're really here to enjoy
the body, create an experience,

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.180 align:middle line:10%
love.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:10%
They say that's what
we all come for.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:10%
We come for love.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.078 align:middle line:10%
And we come to contribute
to the creativity of each

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:09.620 align:middle line:10%
of our perceptions
and what we make--

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.050 align:middle line:10%
we add to the creativity
of the multiverse.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:10%
And we're really here to heal.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:10%
This is what this time is about.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:16.940 align:middle line:10%
We're healing ourselves.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.440 align:middle line:10%
We're healing our ancestors.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:10%
And by healing and eradicating
this unnecessary fear,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:10%
I feel, personally, that
it qualifies us then

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:10%
to meet other beings.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.530 align:middle line:10%
It's that until any
initiation, you meet your fear.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.990 align:middle line:10%
And you can't get to the
other side to those higher

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:10%
frequencies until you
move through your fear.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.960 align:middle line:10%
>> In this influential book, the
Pleiadians refer to the Earth

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:10%
as a living library
in a free will zone.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.348 align:middle line:84%
But what does free
will actually mean?

00:13:53.348 --> 00:13:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It is part of our training,
as first contact specialists,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that we do not intervene or
interfere in certain aspects

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.670 align:middle line:84%
of other civilizations but
let them have the free will

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to discover things
in their own timing.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We cannot intervene or interfere
with something that is a part

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:84%
of your path that it is not
appropriate for us to do.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So we scan the collective
energy, not only of you

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:84%
as a person or
whoever we are talking

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
with, but of the collective
consciousness as well,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.720 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, to find out what
parts of information you see

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:84%
can be delivered
to you by us, what

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.980 align:middle line:84%
parts may need to come
from other sources

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
as a more appropriate delivery
system, what parts are not

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.920 align:middle line:84%
appropriate in timing for you
to know right now according

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:90%
to your own choices--

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.250 align:middle line:84%
in other words, not
spoiling your surprises,

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.440 align:middle line:84%
not opening your Christmas
presents for you, so to speak.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is a multitasking,
multi-dimensional awareness

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:84%
of what is and isn't
appropriate for the timing

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation to deliver
to any particular individual.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:10%
>> We tend to think free will
is our egoic day-to-day self

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:10%
saying, yes, I want to do this.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't want to do that.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But a free will also extends
to our energetic levels

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:90%
and our energetic states.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we
don't know that we

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
are being open to let's say
attack or attachment because it

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:84%
is still our free will
to say, I need this.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you are
working with entities

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that have addictive traits or
addictive qualities to you,

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
they'll whisper into your mind.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:84%
For want of a better word,
it's not necessarily words,

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.820 align:middle line:90%
but it's nudges.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:28.630 align:middle line:90%
It's urges.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.160 align:middle line:84%
They'll whisper this little
poke into you saying, hey,

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.500 align:middle line:84%
isn't it a good
idea to go do that.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And then your free will can
say, yes, sure, why not?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it feels right
or it feels good.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And, again, that's
your free will.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.420 align:middle line:84%
But that moment when
you feel something

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.580 align:middle line:84%
has crossed that line,
crossed that boundary,

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:90%
you could say no.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.102 align:middle line:84%
We're not working
together anymore.

00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:84%
No matter what kind
of being you're

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
working with, a lower-level
entity, higher-level being,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:56.515 align:middle line:84%
they can actually never
violate your free will.

00:15:56.515 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Free will means that every
time you open your mouth,

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.650 align:middle line:10%
you are casting a spell.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Words and your thoughts
and your reactions

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.450 align:middle line:90%
are deciding where energy goes.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.950 align:middle line:84%
So if I say, I
really feel like life

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:84%
is really difficult for
me, then that energy

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.080 align:middle line:84%
belongs to a spirit who
is here to suppress.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So that spirit will come and
then support me in my free will

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:84%
by the words that I've said and
start suppressing me and making

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
whatever I say real because
the purpose of creation

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:36.130 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to experience
all levels of creation.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:40.540 align:middle line:84%
That means that there is no
good or bad, I prefer to say.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:84%
It is based on how
can we serve you.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.410 align:middle line:84%
But then you say,
I change my mind.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:90%
Life isn't hard.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Life is getting better
for me and my ancestors

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.270 align:middle line:90%
are supporting me.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.645 align:middle line:84%
Then the ancestors come in
and they start supporting you.

00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Then you say I really am afraid
of what I'm stepping into.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now a spirit of fear comes
and starts supporting you.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
always tell people,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
so you think free will means
that you can go and buy

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
an ice cream cone, or you can go
and run down the street naked,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or you can do whatever it
is that you want to do.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.619 align:middle line:84%
That's just your
choice to do it.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:12.609 align:middle line:90%
That's not free will.

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:17.238 align:middle line:84%
Free will means that whatever
you do, spirit supports.

00:17:17.238 --> 00:17:21.819 align:middle line:10%
>> We would not usurp the free
will of the human experience

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.410 align:middle line:10%
because every human has a soul.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:90%
And the soul has the power.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:84%
That's why we say, in
the asking, it is given.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
For when you ask,
you're ready to hear

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the information asked for or
there would not be an asking.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.870 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So the only rules come
from you, the soul.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.038 align:middle line:84%
And we share information
when you're ready for it.

00:17:59.038 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Free will and destiny
are side by side.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
You could say that
destiny is simply

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.460 align:middle line:84%
the free will of the
spirit that chose

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%
a certain theme of exploration,
that chose to experience itself

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.740 align:middle line:84%
as the unique you that
you are as a personality.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Free will comes into place
in the physical reality

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how you explore what
it is you chose from the spirit

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
So you could say that the
destiny is the hallway that you

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.790 align:middle line:90%
as a spirit chose to explore.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Free will, in physical
terms, is how you

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.750 align:middle line:90%
choose to explore that hallway.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
You can run.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.100 align:middle line:90%
You can walk.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.900 align:middle line:90%
You can jump.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.720 align:middle line:90%
You can fly.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
You can go forwards, backwards,
side to side, happy, sad,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.600 align:middle line:84%
look in every door down the
hallway or ignore them all.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But walk down that
hallway you will,

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.010 align:middle line:90%
because you are the hallway.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:84%
You are a unique path, a unique
reflection of all that is.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That is your destiny
is to be you.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:84%
How you be you is up
to your free will.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.742 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:10%
>> There are a few takehomes
from the Mount Shasta

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:10%
channeling study.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:10%
One was this process of doing
channeling in a group, which

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:10%
I think is incredibly valuable.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And as a science institution,
we don't come out

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.180 align:middle line:84%
and say, hey, 21
different beings

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.090 align:middle line:84%
were channeled through these
channelers and this is true

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.145 align:middle line:90%
and this is what they said.

00:19:24.145 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:10%
We really try to have a
neutral sense of equanimity

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.110 align:middle line:10%
about the results
that we're presenting

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:10%
and allow people to make their
own decision about whether it's

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:10%
real or not real.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.950 align:middle line:84%
The subjective phenomenon
of these channelers

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
bringing this information forth
is incredibly real to them.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.180 align:middle line:10%
It is tangibly different.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.850 align:middle line:10%
It's visually different.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:84%
The piece that we can't
be definitive about

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.210 align:middle line:84%
is whether that being really
is a being from the Pleiades

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
or from Sirius or from wherever
they-- or an ascended master,

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
or an archangel, or whoever
the beings say they are.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
We can't prove that
through our science.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
If you ask the channelers,
they'll say, yeah, of course,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.350 align:middle line:84%
it is, and here's how it works
and et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And I value their belief
and worldview around that.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But from a scientific
perspective,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:90%
we can't show that.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.436 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait until we can.

00:20:30.436 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not important at all
for people to believe that

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:10%
I'm channeling an alien being.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.920 align:middle line:10%
It could be an aspect
of my own consciousness.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.620 align:middle line:10%
I have no way of proving
that Bashar is real.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
So the message is far more
important than the messenger,

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.690 align:middle line:90%
and Bashar knows that.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
reasons why he has said

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.090 align:middle line:90%
they stay in the background.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't want people to
necessarily focus on, oh, this

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:90%
is an alien.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an ET because we tend
to think of that as greater

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.180 align:middle line:84%
than ourselves and
he's saying it's not.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really more
about what does

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the information do to
improve our lives, to help us

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:04.740 align:middle line:90%
understand more of who we are.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:90%
That's really the point of it.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And to grow in that
knowledge without really

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.148 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the idea of
exactly where it's coming from.

00:21:12.148 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Because if you know
that something positive

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.275 align:middle line:84%
is happening, at the beginning
at least that's enough.

00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:22.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Over my life, I've
communicated with,

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:10%
received guidance from,
wisdom teachings from,

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:10%
much love from so many
multidimensional intelligences.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've had many
experiences actually

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.590 align:middle line:84%
of communicating with
extraterrestrial intelligences.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So the question was, do
those extraterrestrials

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.360 align:middle line:84%
who are communicating
with us, or potentially

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
communicating with
us, have anything

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
to share with us how they might
have gone that path themselves

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:90%
and survived it?

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And immediately that
inner question was asked,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%
I received back this message.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.990 align:middle line:84%
We came to understand,
experience,

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:90%
and embody unity awareness.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they were able
somehow to remember wholeness,

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
to remember the
nature of reality

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
as being inseparable of its
unity expressed as diversity

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:90%
rather than as separate.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.840 align:middle line:84%
They remembered the
reality of love.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Right now, our planet
is in a very critical place

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:43.120 align:middle line:84%
of our evolution that we are
clearly being visited by beings

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:84%
from other worlds and we see
them in our skies on a daily

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:90%
basis.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's at the
point now where even

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.370 align:middle line:84%
the government has acknowledged
that this phenomenon is true.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.900 align:middle line:84%
But the question
is, why aren't they

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.660 align:middle line:84%
landing on the front
lawn of the White House

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and speaking to
all of us openly?

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And this really gets into
the aspect of free will.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
That beings of the
positive polarity

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
are not going to come down
here and interact with us

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with us, until
we, of our own free will,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
collectively acknowledge
them and say we're not

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.720 align:middle line:84%
afraid of you, we know you're
here to be of service to us,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and we want to have a
relationship with you.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, and only then, will
they honor that free will

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and have communication
with us openly.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So I think channeling is this
amazing way that humanity

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
can begin reaching
out to the cosmos

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and exercising our
free will to usher

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:38.290 align:middle line:84%
in this new age of
extraterrestrial communication.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that as
more people develop

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
channel and to bring

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.180 align:middle line:84%
in higher consciousness
to the planet,

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
we will see more texts
like the Law of One that

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.740 align:middle line:84%
are undeniably profound
and undeniably authentic,

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even pockets of
society, different areas who

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.917 align:middle line:84%
come together and say we
believe in this phenomenon,

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.500 align:middle line:84%
we believe in
extraterrestrials, we're

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
going to start contacting
on behalf of the human race.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that we'll
see these groups appearing

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:12.220 align:middle line:84%
on the planet who are starting
to deliver these incredibly

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:84%
profound texts and
information that starts

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to wake other people up and
get the attention of the world

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and say something
truly remarkable

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.010 align:middle line:90%
is happening over here.

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the more interest
is gained by people

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.500 align:middle line:84%
in this phenomenon of
channeling, the more

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that is, in and of itself,
an act of our free will

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge and invite
in this kind of contact.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, and only
then, I think,

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.490 align:middle line:84%
will extraterrestrials
actually begin

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
to interact with us
physically and walk among us.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.340 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I think
there's too much fear around

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrials.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.830 align:middle line:90%
What are their intentions?

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Where do they come from?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.020 align:middle line:90%
Why are they here?

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And channeling texts
like the Law of One

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:84%
can answer those questions
in ways that truly give peace

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:84%
to humankind that these
beings are not here

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.210 align:middle line:84%
with any ill intentions, but,
in fact, quite the opposite.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
They are here to usher us into
the next age of our evolution.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If there are other energies
permeating your space on Earth,

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:84%
they have the wisdom and
ability to be here from other

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.190 align:middle line:84%
universes, other planets,
however its perceived--

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.830 align:middle line:90%
the aliens, if you would.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
They're not here
to be malevolent.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:39.880 align:middle line:84%
They are here in the same
assistance and desire

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
for expansion for you as a
species and all the species

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.556 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:25:49.556 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It is not required that
every single human existing

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
on your planet now needs to
be the kind of person who is

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.830 align:middle line:90%
available for open contact.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We will only be
making open contact

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.330 align:middle line:84%
with the versions of Earth
that are amenable to it.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.670 align:middle line:84%
There may be many versions
of Earth that are not,

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and we will not be making
contact with those.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So the idea now is to
navigate toward the version

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.830 align:middle line:84%
that you prefer that might
have open contact by following

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.060 align:middle line:84%
the formulas that we
share with all of you.

This is what it's designed
to do, not only open up

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:84%
your own lives but also
make it more probable

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:84%
that you match our
frequency more closely

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.620 align:middle line:84%
in order to make
it probable for you

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:84%
to have open contact with us
and other extraterrestrial

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:32.300 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
There will always be a
need for first contact

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.440 align:middle line:90%
with other civilizations.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I have what you might
call job security.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
There are millions of untapped
civilizations out there.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.935 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to run
out any time soon.

00:26:46.935 --> 00:26:50.349 align:middle line:90%

>> As more and more messages
arrive from those out there,

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
the stars shine brightly in our
night sky to remind us that we

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:05.260 align:middle line:84%
have several neighbors nestled
in this majestic galaxy named

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Milky Way.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But as the sun rises
and the blue sky

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.530 align:middle line:84%
returns to this
beautiful living library,

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
we are physically reminded of
a unifying message delivered

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.040 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ages, that
our thoughts, decisions,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and actions have the
power to create miracles.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:34.305 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.305 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> You make thousands
of decisions every day,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
albeit small ones but they're
all decisions, aren't they?

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It's just the bigger ones
you lament over and question

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
rather than paying attention
to what the soul says.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.620 align:middle line:84%
You have evidence in your
life of that being true--

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:90%
all do.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
When a decision has
been made without doubt,

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.980 align:middle line:84%
a must in your life,
not knowing how, when,

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:18.970 align:middle line:84%
or where but it must happen,
and then out of the blue,

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:90%
everything works out.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.110 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle, yes?

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:27.420 align:middle line:90%


00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
You made a miracle by
decision and allowed

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.650 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the quantum
field to do its work.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Out of the blue, we always
like that terminology.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.430 align:middle line:90%
Where do you think blue is?

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:50.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all around you.
