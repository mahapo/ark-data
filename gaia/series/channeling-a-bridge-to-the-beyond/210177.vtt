00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The 1920s are commonly
referred to as The Roaring

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.370 align:middle line:90%
'20s.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.210 align:middle line:84%
During this legendary time,
some of the greatest inventions

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and discoveries to help humanity
unite became fringe theories.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:10%
Game-changers throughout history
spoke of a substance around

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:10%
us called the ether,
and inspired great minds

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.670 align:middle line:10%
to study and invent
ways to harness

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:10%
the energy of this mysterious
quantum field, or etheric net,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.040 align:middle line:10%
That surrounds us.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
As the roar echoes through
this cycle of the '20s,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of
the invisible forces

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in this beautifully connected
and conscious universe

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:90%
becomes more illuminated.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.105 align:middle line:84%
But how do we connect
through the quantum field?

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:12.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Resonance identification.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.750 align:middle line:10%
Training to gain familiarity
with a certain frequency that

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890 align:middle line:10%
is representative of what you
desire to make a connection to,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:10%
and in becoming familiar
with that frequency,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:10%
allowing yourself to fall in
to the support of that energy

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:10%
so that you are not
trying to maintain it,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.340 align:middle line:10%
you are simply riding a
wave, riding a frequency,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:10%
a vibration of energy
that is representative

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:10%
of the connection between us.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the mechanism
behind all forms

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of channeling or cognition
through consciousness.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I want to start with a really
exciting study we did with

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:10%
trans-channelers.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So there were five
trans-channelers

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.240 align:middle line:90%
that we took to Mt.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Shasta, California, and we
rented this beautiful house

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and we spent three
days together.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.560 align:middle line:10%
And in those three days, we
had multiple different sessions

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:10%
with many different
types of channeling.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And it was really
an exploratory study

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:10%
to see how channeling
worked and to ask

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:10%
a variety of different research
questions to the channelers

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:10%
in a channeling state to
see what answers they gave.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.670 align:middle line:10%
>> At times we struggle
with the human vessels.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.450 align:middle line:10%
As you all know, we have
multidimensional lanes

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:10%
of conversation that we
can express between us

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:10%
at the same time.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that they
talked about when we asked

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:84%
about source was that the
channeler and the supposed

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:84%
channel being were
aspects of each other.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this lines
up with this concept

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that we're all interconnected
and we're all one.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And so even if it's perceived
as a different personality,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
per se, that when you
step back and look

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
at the big picture of the
wholeness of all of reality,

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
it is an aspect
of the channeler.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.940 align:middle line:10%
>> When we speak in terms
of channelers or modern day

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:10%
prophets, we think in terms of
whether they were able to see

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:10%
the future.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.340 align:middle line:84%
But from a 21st
century perspective,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
we may be able to dispense
with terms like "future"

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how we understand
past, present, future,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:84%
and think more in terms of there
being an infinitude of events

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:84%
that go outside of linear
time, which is really what

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
our primary
interpretations of quantum

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.520 align:middle line:84%
physics, our models
like string theory

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:84%
give us, that everything
is happening all at once.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So it may be that the
clairvoyant is not

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
gleaning the future so much as
he or she is gleaning what's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.470 align:middle line:84%
actually going on infinitely
and all at once in the cosmos

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%
or the world around us.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The universe has great
consciousness that we can all

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:90%
work with and work inside of.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of
our little consciousness

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
that we have here
is just permutations

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
of that great universal
consciousness.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.880 align:middle line:10%
And with the universal
consciousness everywhere

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:10%
all the time, the Akashic
records is its memory.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing that's
cool about the memory

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
of the universal
consciousness is

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.890 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't know time or space.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:90%
It's completely nonlinear.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So you have access to the
memory of the universe

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.160 align:middle line:90%
just by tuning into it.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting
way of using channeling.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.820 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most unexpected
and radical discoveries

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:10%
of the early quantum
physicists was something called

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:10%
nonlocality, which means that
to understand what they were

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:10%
discovering required the entire
universe to exist and evolve

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:10%
as a unified entity with no
limitations in space and time.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we experience
our universe

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:84%
as being founded
on space and time

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.210 align:middle line:84%
where within space and time,
there is a cosmic speed limit,

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it's called the speed of light.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
So there was a huge debate
going on between the quantum

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
physicists and people like
Albert Einstein as to who

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:90%
was right.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
they were both right.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Because if we go back
to the very first moment

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
of our universe that
I sometimes refer

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
to as the first moment
not of the Big Bang,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.630 align:middle line:84%
but of a Big Breath, a
space began to expand.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Time began to flow
in one way only.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And what that meant
is our entire universe

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:84%
had this experience
of evolution where

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
one moment followed the
next for 13.8 billion years.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.140 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact is, we've known
through Einstein's theory

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.630 align:middle line:84%
of relativity, for example,
that time itself is conditional.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Linear time itself is
really a necessary illusion

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.070 align:middle line:84%
that we five-sensory
beings used to navigate

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.170 align:middle line:84%
our way through life,
to get through life.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
We know from different
interpretations of quantum

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
mechanics that we very
probably live in a reality

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
where an infinitude of events
are playing out constantly,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.645 align:middle line:84%
and they become localized
only through perspective.

00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But we through different
models of time,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
space, speed, that
we are probably

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
going to have to come to
terms with some conception

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.150 align:middle line:84%
of interdimensionality, to
understand the things that we

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:84%
are observing in
our world today.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> As a scientist on your
planet might be prone to do,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
attempt to reduce everything
to its simplest form--

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.770 align:middle line:84%
in other words, they are seeking
the idea of a unified field

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:90%
theory--

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
by attempting to unite and
connect how all of what

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
appears to be multiple
forces or effects

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:84%
are actually simply
different expressions

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:90%
of one single effect.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to include
the idea of reducing

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.430 align:middle line:90%
time and space as well.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So the full reduction of space
is into a dimensionless point.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:84%
The full reduction of time
is into a timeless now.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, everything that
exists everywhere, everywhen,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you call
past, present, or future,

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.320 align:middle line:84%
all exists simultaneously
in that dimensionless space,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
in that timeless now, and
therefore, is easily accessible

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
anywhere, any when, because
every single location

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
and every single time frame
is simply another perspective

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.080 align:middle line:84%
of the same moment
and the same place,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.180 align:middle line:84%
just from a different
point of view.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But it makes sense to me that
if we were all one at the Big

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Bang and we expanded
out from there,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.200 align:middle line:84%
that we would still
be connected somehow.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And that
interconnectedness, or what

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I've called the Big C, which
is the fundamental nature

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.330 align:middle line:84%
of reality, when you
hold that world view,

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:84%
the phenomenon that we
are experiencing totally

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:90%
makes sense.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only am I personally
experiencing this phenomenon,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:90%
but I see it all around me.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly common.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
All the surveys
that we've done have

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.980 align:middle line:84%
shown that almost everybody
has had at least one channeling

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.060 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
There's been surveys done
all over the world showing

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.670 align:middle line:84%
very high percentages
of people that

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
have had these experiences.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Many scientists have had
periods of time which were

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:84%
so intense that they felt they
were on the receiving of great,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.240 align:middle line:90%
great insights and wisdom.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein had his
year in miracles in 1905.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And Isaac Newton
had his in 1666.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:10%
Newton, in that time, came
up with incredible ways

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.960 align:middle line:10%
of describing mathematically
what he was discovering,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.380 align:middle line:10%
but he made
incredible discoveries

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.720 align:middle line:10%
around the nature of light and
optics, and gravity, of course.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:10%
Einstein, in his
year in miracles,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:10%
were realizing the
relativity of space and time

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:10%
and connecting them together
in absolute space-time.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So both of them recognized that
they were receiving this higher

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:90%
vibrational wisdom.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.185 align:middle line:90%
They were channeling it.

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Another powerful physicist
that some believe was tapping

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
into higher forms of
information was Nikola Tesla.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.580 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1800s, he created
the basic system of radio.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:10%
He went on to invent
several ways to harness

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.640 align:middle line:10%
and transmit energy and
shifted from employee

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.520 align:middle line:10%
to rival in Thomas Edison's
growing energy empire.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Both Nikola Tesla and Thomas
Edison were interested in this

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.410 align:middle line:90%
idea of invisible forces.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:90%
What else is electricity?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:90%
What else are X-rays?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:90%
What else are radio waves?

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:90%
What else are wireless signals?

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:10%
And so both inventors believed
that our world was suffused

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:10%
with invisible
forces and energies

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.800 align:middle line:10%
and these weren't
limited to things

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.820 align:middle line:10%
that could be used
to power a locomotive

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:10%
or send an electrical
signal through a wire,

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:10%
but also had a
psychical dimension.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So both were very interested
in extra physical dimension

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.620 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And Edison, back
in his days when

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
he was part of the
early Theosophical

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Society in New York
City in the 1870s,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.590 align:middle line:84%
disclosed to some
members that he

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.470 align:middle line:84%
was attempting to create a
device that could function

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of spiritual telegraph
and used to communicate

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.810 align:middle line:90%
with the other side.

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Tesla, he was being guided.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:10%
He was channeling, if
you would, just ask each

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:10%
and every one of you has a
brilliance, significant gift

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:10%
that is unique to you alone.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
imploring you to do.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The deeper we dive
into the quantum well,

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:90%
the more it becomes clear.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
This universe is supremely
sophisticated in design

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.050 align:middle line:90%
and structure.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But there's one theory
that may help us understand

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:90%
how cosmic connections work.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not a physicist, but
I love learning about quantum

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.040 align:middle line:10%
physics and this whole
concept of entanglement.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So at the Big Bang, we
were all interconnected.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:90%
And it expanded from there.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And so at one point, we were
all entangled with each other.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And so now they have
demonstrated repeatedly

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
in laboratory environments the
entanglement of photons where

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.720 align:middle line:84%
you take two photons and
entangle them, take one of them

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:84%
halfway across the world,
when you move the spin of one,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.670 align:middle line:84%
the other one spins in the
same direction instantaneously.

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:90%
That's absolutely incredible.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And they've done that with a
variety of different things

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Not just photons with things--

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.530 align:middle line:84%
larger molecules
called buckyballs,

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:90%
and even with diamonds.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you take this
concept of entanglement

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
and take it to a macroscale,
it leaves a lot more room

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
for these phenomenon
of channeling.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum physics discovered
that our universe can only

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
exist and evolve as a
nonlocally unified entity.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That means that on one
side of the universe,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
something can happen
that is synchronistic

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:84%
only mirrored at the other
side of the universe.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It's sometimes called
quantum entanglement.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
that is it suggests

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that it only happens at a tiny
scale of the quantum world.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:10%
Whereas in 2018, a
team that MIT actually

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:10%
were able to entangle
photons of light

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:10%
in the laboratory with starlight
coming from 600 light years

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:10%
away, and that
entanglement, which

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:10%
means that they act
as one, was triggered

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:10%
by the light from something
called a quasar over 12 billion

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.190 align:middle line:10%
light years away.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.900 align:middle line:84%
So what they're able
to experimentally show

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:37.650 align:middle line:84%
is that such entanglement is
the breadth of our universe.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
It's an innate phenomenon,
an attribute of our universe.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:90%
That's why channeling works.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why supernormal
phenomena work.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:84%
That's why all that
we're talking about

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:90%
is natural phenomena.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They're natural because our
universe exists and evolves

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.820 align:middle line:90%
in this way.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Basically, channeling is what
they are discovering with this

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:10%
communication of one atom being
able to transmit information

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:14.270 align:middle line:10%
to an atom in another star, in
another solar system in just

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:10%
less than a second
because they are the same,

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:10%
they became the same.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And even if they are
in different planets

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.740 align:middle line:10%
and different solar systems
and different galaxies,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:10%
they are entangled,
they are connected.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.690 align:middle line:10%
That's quantum mechanics
and all these things

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:10%
that scientists were
trying to explain.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:90%
So we are also atoms.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:90%
We are made of atoms, particles.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.510 align:middle line:10%
So we can also
become someone else

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:10%
and receive a message
from another solar system

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:10%
in less than a second.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Theo says the quantum
field is all around us.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just like electricity.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.100 align:middle line:90%
It's always been all around us.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Still is.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:10%
And that it just took
away, like for electricity,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:10%
to harness that and to
make it useful to us.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And it works the same
way all over the world.

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Turning on lights and computers
and all that kind of thing.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's not limited to
that conduit in your house

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
or business or whatever it is.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:90%
It exists all the time.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, the quantum
field, the connectivity

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking
about, we are just

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
learning now how to be
the conduit for that

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.870 align:middle line:90%
and tap into it.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's hard for the
human mind to grasp that we can

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:59.070 align:middle line:84%
all be one and yet still
feel very separate and unique

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and distinct.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
In the Mt.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Shasta study, they talked about
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
spectrum is very wide

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.859 align:middle line:84%
and has many, many
different frequencies in it,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
from visible light to infrared
to ultraviolet, et cetera.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
But when you think about that
spectrum, it's all one thing.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But if you took one
frequency of that spectrum,

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that frequency would have very
unique characteristics to it.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can liken this
human experience

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
as Helane being
the one frequency

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:84%
on that electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.710 align:middle line:84%
So I feel unique, I feel
different, I feel separate,

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
and yet I'm still part of this
vast, wide electromagnetic

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
spectrum that goes into
infinity on both sides.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> The word aura has been used
to describe an energetic field

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:90%
around the human body.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It is known to be created by
a measurable electromagnetic

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.750 align:middle line:84%
energy, as well as the
emanation of a more

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:90%
ethereal or a subtle energy.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
The National Institute of Health
has named this mysterious aura

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
the human biofield.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Sometimes during
a channeling,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:10%
electronics in a room,
like recorders and cameras,

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:10%
may be affected by
the channeling itself.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is because when I'm
making a connection to Bashar,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm raising my frequency
to match his frequency

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:90%
a little bit closer.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
But like every human, I have
an electromagnetic field.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, my
electromagnetic field

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is affected by that,
the frequency changes,

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and it can start interacting
with electronic equipment

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:90%
in the area.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And that can sometimes cause
things to just completely shut

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:84%
Whatever happens in
the channel's body's

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.570 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field is simply
the result of whatever state

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:84%
of being is representative
of the information

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
or the state of our connection
happens to be at that moment.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.470 align:middle line:10%
It's not something I
have to intentionally do.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:10%
When we did the EEG experiment
in the documentary "First

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:10%
Contact," we did that
specifically not only

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:10%
to demystify the
idea of channeling

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.920 align:middle line:10%
as being an unusual
thing, but to find out

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.493 align:middle line:10%
what is really going
on in the brain

00:19:27.493 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:10%
when I'm in a channeling
state or anyone

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:10%
is in a channeling state?

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And we discovered some
very profound differences

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
occur in that state
from what you would call

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:38.070 align:middle line:90%
your normal daily waking state.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:10%
One of the most profound
differences that affected me

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:10%
a lot was to find
out that there are

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:10%
certain centers
in the brain that

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:10%
are responsible for
processing what I

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:10%
would consider my personality.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And that during the channeling,
those all shut down.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:10%
So if the parts of my brain that
process my personality when I'm

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:10%
awake shut off, who's talking?

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.180 align:middle line:10%
In the beginning
of the channeling,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.210 align:middle line:10%
the channel was capable of
holding onto, shall we say,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:10%
or bringing through the idea of
about 1.5 to 2% of our energy.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:10%
In the ensuing years following
the initiation of contact

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:10%
with the channel, it
was thus then capable

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:10%
in the channel's body of
expressing our energy up

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:10%
to about 3%.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.720 align:middle line:10%
On average now, we are
expressing about 5%

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:10%
of our total energy.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:10%
>> So we're looking at a picture
of Darryl's baseline EEG.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:10%
And what I've done is to
record Darryl's baseline when

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.670 align:middle line:10%
he is not channeling and
compare that to his EEG

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.440 align:middle line:10%
when he is channeling.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.630 align:middle line:10%
Now here is a picture of
Darryl's raw EEG baseline again

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.080 align:middle line:10%
in which we see a very
rounded and rhythmic

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.290 align:middle line:10%
dominant frequency, we call
it, in the posterior cortex

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:10%
or the back of the head.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:06.660 align:middle line:10%
And this is a good finding,
it's a positive finding

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:10%
because it tells us that
Darryl's nervous system is

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:10%
stable.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And also, that he
has what we call

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.920 align:middle line:10%
good thalamocortical
functioning.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.120 align:middle line:10%
And this is a common
feature, a characteristic

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:10%
that is found in individuals
who are peak performers.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:10%
So here, we have a picture
of what disconnects

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:10%
when Darryl begins to channel.

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And you can see the areas in
blue, the functional Brodmann

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:10%
areas, we call them, that are
not used when he is channeling.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:10%
And it appears
that he disconnects

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.030 align:middle line:10%
from his personal
sense of self, he

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.550 align:middle line:10%
disconnects from the
experience of pain.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:10%
Now what increases when
he begins to channel

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.740 align:middle line:10%
is, first of all,
his processing speed.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And processing speed is a
very interesting phenomenon

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.890 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is it
develops early in childhood.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And by about the
age of five or six,

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:10%
and certainly nine or 10
maximum, we reach a set point,

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:10%
and this set point
doesn't usually

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:10%
change during the lifetime.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.850 align:middle line:10%
And in Daryl's case,
it actually went up

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:10%
when he began to channel.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:10%
And it increased
when he listened.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:10%
The actual frequency
of the processing speed

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:23.250 align:middle line:10%
was tuned to an exact
frequency all over the brain.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to realize that
the only reason the set point

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.890 align:middle line:84%
changes is because
the connection with us

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and our vibrations as the
channel takes on a new

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:84%
frequency means that the channel
is a different person with

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.720 align:middle line:90%
a different set point.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Remember, all change is actually
a shift to a different reality,

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:90%
a different version of yourself.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
You may think it's the
same person, but it's not.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Literally, it's not.

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Therefore the
change in set point

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.980 align:middle line:84%
actually represents a
measurable aspect of the fact

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that a person has become
a different person

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
in a different reality
and is now operating

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:90%
on a different frequency.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:10%
>> To summarize sort of what
I found here in Darryl's brain

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:10%
in comparison with
the channeling state,

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:10%
he starts from a very
stable resting state.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:16.240 align:middle line:10%
And then he experiences changes
that statistically less than 1%

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:10%
of the population would
experience in the same way.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.260 align:middle line:10%
He increases his
processing speed.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:10%
He tunes it exquisitely to one
frequency all over the brain.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:10%
And then he's able to
create a resonant holding

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:10%
environment for the peak
performance or the channeling

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.090 align:middle line:10%
to happen.

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:40.570 align:middle line:10%
He pumps energy into
the right frontal cortex

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:10%
and the right auditory cortex
so that he can empathize

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:10%
and hear very, very clearly.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:10%
And because of the gamma
frequencies in the anterior

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:53.050 align:middle line:10%
cingulate, he can shift gears.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:57.400 align:middle line:10%
He'll be able to shift gears and
navigate cognition, thoughts,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:10%
and emotions very,
very flexibly.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And he'll be able to interpret
from a higher perspective,

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.960 align:middle line:10%
from a more evolved
place in his mind,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.960 align:middle line:10%
much like from the
highest mountaintop.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>> We wanted to take a little
bit more of a scientific

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.010 align:middle line:90%
approach.

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Again, not to prove
anything to anybody,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
but just to show that it can
be discovered through a more

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.310 align:middle line:84%
scientific approach that there
are different things happening,

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that altered states
are real in channeling,

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and that something
profoundly different

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:84%
is happening in people when
they get into that state.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you want to believe
that is is up to you,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.370 align:middle line:84%
but something
different is happening.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So with my scientist hat on,
there's no tool that we have

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:48.310 align:middle line:84%
today that can definitively
say what the source is.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
proving what the source is

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and if this really is
a nonphysical being,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.870 align:middle line:84%
a separate physical
personality, I

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
can't really definitively
say that one way or another

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific perspective.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We are looking to develop
objective tools where

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
we can tell if there is a
different frequency in the room

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of shift
in the environment,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and yet today, we can't really
prove one way or another

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:26.510 align:middle line:84%
if it actually is a
discarnate being that's

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.220 align:middle line:90%
entering the person's body.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
From a personal
perspective, my felt sense

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.260 align:middle line:84%
when I'm actually
doing this phenomenon

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.970 align:middle line:84%
is that the sensations
are different when it's,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
say, my grandmother supposedly
talking to my mother

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:52.310 align:middle line:84%
or when it's my main
guide that's supposedly

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.570 align:middle line:84%
talking through me or some
other supposed being talking

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.930 align:middle line:84%
through me that
energetically it feels

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.870 align:middle line:90%
very different in my body.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:08.180 align:middle line:84%
My voice is different, my
mannerisms are different,

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:12.220 align:middle line:90%
and it feels distinct.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As more and more humans
consciously connect with other

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, what messages will
be delivered to help empower

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
our understanding of the
vast and expanding cosmos?

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The Earth is only one
choice of incarnation.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
It's only one choice
out of billions

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.050 align:middle line:84%
of choices and
billions of planets

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.435 align:middle line:90%
that are not unlike Earth.

00:26:45.435 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:90%


00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And science is bringing
that forth as we speak.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.320 align:middle line:84%
A recognition of
this, if you would.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:02.950 align:middle line:84%
There are also, as we speak,
12 dimensions about the Earth.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.790 align:middle line:90%
They've already discovered 11.

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:12.490 align:middle line:84%
The 12th will be a
discovery as well soon.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of this is
broadening the aperture

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge of the human
experience on Earth,

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.170 align:middle line:90%
but not limited to Earth.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.520 align:middle line:10%
