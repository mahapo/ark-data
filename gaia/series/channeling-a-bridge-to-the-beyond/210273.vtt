00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The word intuition has taken
many names throughout human

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:90%
history--

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:84%
the sixth sense, inner knowing,
gut feeling, inner guidance.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Near the end of
the US Civil War,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:84%
in 1865, Julia Grant, the wife
of commanding Union general

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Ulysses S. Grant, has a
feeling and urges him not

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
to join President
Lincoln at Ford's Theater

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
on that fateful
night of April 14th.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Whatever humanity labels
this innate ability,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.525 align:middle line:84%
the question remains
is it channeling.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Intuition is the aspect of
your being that is the sensual

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:10%
aspect of your being.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:10%
It is the energy of
being able to commune

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:10%
in spirit with all things that
are created without creating

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
rules or regulations
on how that operates,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:10%
and when you're
in that space, you

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:10%
are connected to
everything in all.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Every single cell in your
body and every single energy

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.230 align:middle line:84%
in your being is talking to
every single thing around you,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
but your brain, based on
how it's been regulated,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
can only pick up
on certain aspects

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:90%
of that level of communication.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into
your emotional body, that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.085 align:middle line:84%
is how you develop a strong
intuition because what happens

00:01:56.085 --> 00:02:01.170 align:middle line:84%
is instead of trying to
analyze the information that's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
coming in, which is actually
taking you out of intuition,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
you begin to merge with
everything around you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.310 align:middle line:84%
so then you can
actually already know

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.790 align:middle line:90%
what's going to take place.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:90%
You can feel what's happening.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You can sense which
choice to make.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:84%
You know which direction to
go because your everything is

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.270 align:middle line:84%
communicating to you
and it just moves you.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
You do it without
actually thinking.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You do it because you
know it is to be done.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe our intuitive self
to be our most natural self.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We are all intuitive
beings, and we are meant

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
to intuit our way through life.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660 align:middle line:10%
And we have our own
navigational system

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:10%
through our body and our
feelings and our curiosities.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And so as children, we're
generally very open,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:90%
very loving.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We're totally in
our feeling self.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Children's intuitive
systems are wide open when

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:10%
they're born.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:10%
It's the ages of 5, 6, and 7
when we take them to school

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.960 align:middle line:10%
and start to conform with
rules and regulations, which

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:10%
are fine and necessary,
but it starts

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:10%
to shut that system down.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.000 align:middle line:84%
They move from their inner
world to the outer world,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and that's when
social-constructed reality

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
really starts to set in and
jam up the system a little bit.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
really interesting

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
that in psychology, hero
worship starts around 8 to 10

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:90%
to 12 years of age.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And so what we do is we take our
inner superhero when we take it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
outside of us and put it
into animation and Superman

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.970 align:middle line:90%
and Spider-Man and Wonder woman.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:90%
But really we are those inside.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
We can see through walls.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.016 align:middle line:84%
We can leap with our mind
anywhere we want to go.

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We all have
evidence in our lives.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.710 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:10%
At some point, we heard a voice.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.355 align:middle line:10%
We had a gut feeling.

00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We followed a knowing, and we
don't know where it came from.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything worked out.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
We have evidence in our
lives, large or small,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
where we've listened to that
whisper, that inner whisper.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's our
higher self or a guide

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or whatever we want
to call it, that's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:84%
what we need to
pay attention to.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Usually, we get that impulse.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.610 align:middle line:84%
We get the whisper, and then our
intellectual mind takes over.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:90%
It starts talking us out of it.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Paying attention to that first
insight, that first message,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.980 align:middle line:90%
and follow it through.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And then our
intellect will not try

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to discourage us from-- it
just wants to stay in control

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and protect us.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.425 align:middle line:84%
But our intuition
is where we expand.

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:02.997 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.997 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> For most of the modern
world, medical advice has been

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
tethered to using only
physical evidence to diagnose

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.490 align:middle line:90%
an illness.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
one uses their intuition

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
to see beyond the physical
into the emotional root

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:90%
cause of the illness?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.810 align:middle line:84%
There are historical examples
of energy practitioners

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.590 align:middle line:84%
throughout the 1800
and early 1900s.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Books like "The
Therapeutic Touch"

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.840 align:middle line:84%
illuminate the power of
being a conduit for energy

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
to flow through the
practitioner to another person.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
No touch healing practices
are gaining in popularity.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Modalities like reiki are used
to tune the body's biofield as

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.630 align:middle line:84%
well as our energetic
chakras throughout the body.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
With all the ways to
facilitate healing,

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
there are several examples
where no physical contact is

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.135 align:middle line:90%
present for healing to occur.

00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:04.895 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Medical intuition is
a process essentially

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.300 align:middle line:10%
of resonance.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.000 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing
is you're actually

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.200 align:middle line:84%
attuning to that person's
vibrational state,

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
and if that person's
vibrational state is not

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
at its fundamental
level of wholeness

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
but it's out of
kilter, it's dis-eased,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.690 align:middle line:84%
then the body knows the original
template, the consciousness

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.830 align:middle line:90%
of its template.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So medical intuitive
can actually

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
pick up on where that
dis-ease is embodied,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
can actually resonate with
that and in various ways help

00:06:52.110 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that person to regain, to
reset their whole informational

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:90%
embodiment back to health.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I do when
I go into a session and I work

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
with people all over the world
and no one's sitting in front

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
of me and I know their name,
I watch their nervous system

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
respond to their words.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.040 align:middle line:84%
That's where the secrets are
because the nervous system

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
and its various components
of the nervous system

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.720 align:middle line:84%
are part of the
intuitive system.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So I watch that first off,
and that tells me where to go.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, I'm
watching energy fluctuations

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.970 align:middle line:84%
where another system
may be chiming in.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:36.930 align:middle line:90%
What's going on.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling things.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes before I even get
on the phone with someone,

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.200 align:middle line:84%
my back will go out or
I'll become nauseous

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.430 align:middle line:90%
or I'll get a headache.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.410 align:middle line:84%
I call it full
spectrum intuition

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.140 align:middle line:84%
because I can from the
Clair point of view

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
is see, feel, hear, no,
taste, smell, all of it.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:54.842 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in-- I know
this may sound gross,

00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't gross
me out at all-- when

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm in someone's liver looking
at cell structure or the blood,

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I can taste the
medication they may be on.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.900 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in someone's brain
looking at synaptic function,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I can taste alcohol if
they've had too much

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's still in their brain.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.150 align:middle line:84%
It's still heavily
in their blood.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.990 align:middle line:84%
So I can taste and
smell and do all of it.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.281 align:middle line:84%
All of it happens
at the same time.

00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:23.670 align:middle line:10%
>> I so appreciated having
that intuitive capacity with

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:10%
my patients.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:84%
In interviews with them, I
would get downloads about things

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
that they might be experiencing,
which I could then follow up

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.200 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
Through my clinical
training, I also

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
became certified
as a reiki master,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.900 align:middle line:84%
so I went through energy
medicine training.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
As I would move my
hands over them,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I could actually
notice things that

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.140 align:middle line:84%
were going on in their body,
places where there were blocks

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
or obstacles, areas
that needed attention,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and that really
helped me support them

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.095 align:middle line:90%
on their path to healing.

00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I call what I do functional
medical intuition because, one,

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
it has to be functional in
the practical way, and, two,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
it's functional in a broad
spectrum point of view.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand the anatomy

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.175 align:middle line:84%
and physiology of the body,
and that's very important.

00:09:15.175 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people come
to me because they

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:10%
don't want to go
to their doctors,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:10%
and one of the things I do
as a medical intuitive is I

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:10%
assess the various
structures, organ systems,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:10%
et cetera, of the body and
can tell what's going on

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:10%
and then ask them if
they would strongly

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:10%
consider going to this
or that doctor that

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:10%
would be the proper one
for their health care

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:10%
because you don't want
to go to a neurologist

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:10%
if you have an
osteopathic issue.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.550 align:middle line:10%
So I send people to
doctors all the time.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
So medical intuition
is very valuable.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
It will never replace
Western medicine.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It will never replace
Chinese medicine.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It shouldn't.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an adjunct.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:84%
They are
interconnected, and it's

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.340 align:middle line:84%
integral to the part of the
work with a medical intuitive

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.580 align:middle line:84%
to be able to understand these
different systems of medicine

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and the energy of
the body in order

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.776 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate health and
well-being for the clients.

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Our entire body
is coherently,

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
meaningfully informed
by consciousness,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:90%
is consciousness.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So medical intuition
just naturally

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is a way of serving
that understanding.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that applications like
that, like medical intuition,

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.770 align:middle line:84%
are really going to help us move
channeling into the mainstream

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:90%
more quickly.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when you have
a practical application

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
of something, the desire
to know how it works

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
is not as important
as it actually working

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and having some benefits.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So if people are having massive
improvements in their health

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and diagnostics
making it cheaper

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
for our health care system,
that would be a huge benefit

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.850 align:middle line:90%
to all of us.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Though we're not ready
yet as a society for this,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.340 align:middle line:10%
but it is creeping
into hospitals,

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:10%
Reiki is done in
surgery rooms now.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So not all of them but
there are headways.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:90%
We're getting there.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
beyond my lifetime,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'm glad to be a
part of the beginning.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1854, the American
clockmaker and mentalist

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Phineas Quimby started his
medical intuitive healing

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:10%
Most labeled him a medical
clairvoyant or medical psychic,

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.010 align:middle line:10%
but the work of
Edgar Cayce truly

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:10%
opened the door for
modern medical intuitives

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.905 align:middle line:10%
to begin blooming.

00:11:49.905 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Edgar Cayce was
an interesting one.

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:10%
He was called the
sleeping prophet

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:10%
because what he would
do was lay down, go

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:10%
into a deep, relaxed state,
become open and receptive

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.180 align:middle line:10%
to information
flowing through him,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:10%
and then he would channel that
information coming through.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:10%
So he was called
the sleeping prophet

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.020 align:middle line:10%
because it looked
like he was sleeping

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:10%
but really he was doing
trance channeling.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Perhaps the most famous
channeler of all time is Edgar

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.350 align:middle line:10%
Cayce.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce essentially
coined the term channeling.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And when you read the
works of Edgar Cayce,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.800 align:middle line:84%
there's no question that it's
incredibly genuine contact,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.480 align:middle line:84%
but the question
has always been who

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.270 align:middle line:84%
or what was Edgar
Cayce channeling.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, Edgar was
just such a pioneer

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.500 align:middle line:84%
in this field in
that there probably

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.900 align:middle line:84%
wasn't much information
available if any

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
at his time of how to actually
perform this act of channeling.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:10%
And so I think Edgar was
probably led very intuitively,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.980 align:middle line:10%
maybe by a guide, to know the
right conditions to put himself

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.220 align:middle line:10%
in, laying horizontally in
a place that would allow him

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.950 align:middle line:10%
to relax deep enough
into a trance state,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:10%
and he could be given
addresses of locations to find

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.410 align:middle line:10%
or questions about people's
physical illness in the body

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.960 align:middle line:10%
and what was the medical
condition they were having.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:10%
And he would essentially channel
the field of consciousness,

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.540 align:middle line:10%
which contains all
information in the universe,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.240 align:middle line:10%
and deliver these answers,
which some people may

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.410 align:middle line:10%
call remote viewing.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
Some people may call channeling.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:middle line:84%
It's really the same
phenomenon just happening

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:90%
in a slightly different way.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's really
no end to the amount

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.520 align:middle line:84%
of ways that we can channel
or things we can channel,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
things we can channel

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:84%
is the field of
consciousness itself.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.293 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't always have to
be another entity who's

00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:84%
speaking through
us, but it can be

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.530 align:middle line:84%
a way of just accessing
information, which

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce somehow learned
how to do all on his own.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.870 align:middle line:10%
>> What I understand about Edgar
Cayce's work is it was a huge,

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:10%
broad depth of information from
information about the past,

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.590 align:middle line:10%
supposed experiences
of Atlantis,

00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:10%
versus information about things
in different distant places

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:10%
and then very real,
practical health information

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:10%
for the people that
he was working with.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce's material was
the first channeled material

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.860 align:middle line:84%
that I really was exposed to
after my family experiences

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:84%
so amazed me that there was
someone else in the world that

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.750 align:middle line:84%
was doing something similar and
was actually getting incredibly

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:84%
useful information from that
was helping a lot of people.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.010 align:middle line:10%
I think it's a great
testament to his work

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:10%
that we see that his
organization is still

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.500 align:middle line:10%
alive and well today and
people using his advice

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.165 align:middle line:10%
for health issues
around the world.

00:14:46.165 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I first learned about
Edgar Cayce about 19 years

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:90%
into my work.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:10%
I found it fascinating that
he slept through his work.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.220 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not quite
sure how he did

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.860 align:middle line:10%
that, but my sense
is when I look back,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.590 align:middle line:10%
I would assess
where his body was.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:10%
And he was really in this
kind of Sleeping Beauty state.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.370 align:middle line:10%
His nervous system
was very, very calm

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.210 align:middle line:10%
when he would be in his state,
and vagal system particularly

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:10%
was uninterrupted
in its softness.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So he was definitely in a
parasympathetic nervous state

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.640 align:middle line:90%
when he was doing that work.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And really when I look at him
lying there and his scribe next

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to him, he was
really floating out

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.480 align:middle line:84%
of his body he wasn't
really in his body fully.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
His spirit was mostly
out of his body.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce would go
into the dream world,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
into the spirit world,
into the astral planes.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:10%
Now he would go into
the spirit world,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:10%
find the ones that had the
knowledge he was looking for,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.560 align:middle line:10%
and then he would bring it back
and then solve the situations

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:10%
in the physical world.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very shamanic thing
as well because what you're

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.150 align:middle line:84%
doing is in shamanism if, for
instance, a Lakota elder who's

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.248 align:middle line:84%
a shaman has--
there's a difficulty

00:16:04.248 --> 00:16:06.040 align:middle line:84%
and he wants to understand
about the tribe,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.810 align:middle line:84%
he will go into sleep and go
sleep, go into the dream world,

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.420 align:middle line:84%
meet up with different
spirits, ask them

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the questions he needs
to get the information,

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
come back, and then
deliver it to the tribe.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And so dreaming is a huge part
of how we and shamanism operate

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.330 align:middle line:84%
our powers because the dream
world and the physical world

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.220 align:middle line:90%
are merged.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Edgar Cayce did what we
have previously talked about

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.170 align:middle line:10%
and simply altered his frequency
to allow him to align with

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:10%
the idea that all
information is here and now.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.020 align:middle line:84%
You may say in a
typical fashion,

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:84%
he aligned with the concept you
call the Akashic Records, which

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
allowed him access to
information that would seem

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.570 align:middle line:84%
far and wide, but,
again, it's just

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
a matter of aligning
the energy with what

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is truly present in the moment
on many different levels

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
from many different
perspectives all at once.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.180 align:middle line:10%
>> He could do all of that.

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:10%
He had guidance with
him at all times.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:10%
That is why he used more
what would be described

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:10%
as remote viewing because it was
more acceptable to be described

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.069 align:middle line:10%
in such a way.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:27.000 align:middle line:10%
But he had a strong connectivity
to his guidance as well.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:10%
And of the time
when he was living,

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:10%
for the acceptance of
the individual asking

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:10%
for his assistance,
there had to be a belief

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:10%
in what he could do for them--

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:50.475 align:middle line:10%
yes-- to have the
effect that was desired.

00:17:50.475 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:84%
So here's another thing
that ones must know.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.044 align:middle line:90%
You must believe.

00:18:02.044 --> 00:18:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Remote viewing is a form
of ESP in which the individual

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:12.730 align:middle line:10%
generally goes into a relaxed
state and is able to gain

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:10%
coordinates or mental pictures
or some form of information

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:10%
in a way that's extra
cognitive or extrasensory.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.880 align:middle line:10%
And so, for example, for
about 20 years running,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:10%
the CIA sponsored a
program in remote viewing

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.260 align:middle line:10%
it sometimes popularly called
psychic spying program,

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:10%
and there were extraordinary
hits as well as controversies

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:10%
that came out of that program.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.570 align:middle line:84%
But essentially it
involved individuals

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
who seemed to have a proclivity
for remote viewing going

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
into a room by themselves
maybe sometimes

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.880 align:middle line:84%
with a pad and
pencil, and they were

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:84%
able to gain a kind
of mental picture

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:59.740 align:middle line:84%
or even coordinates of
some object or event that

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.670 align:middle line:90%
was being sought.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Remote viewing is part of a
whole range of phenomena that

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.060 align:middle line:84%
can come under the
framing of channeling,

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in other words accessing
non-local information

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:90%
and expressing it in some way.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So remote viewing for me is when
we can, in our inner vision,

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
project ourselves non locally
through space and through time.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
But I would say it's one
of a whole panoply of what

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I refer to as
supernormal phenomena,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.650 align:middle line:84%
not supernatural, not
paranormal, but supernormal.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.910 align:middle line:84%
They take us into a slightly
altered state of our awareness

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:50.230 align:middle line:84%
where I often talk about showing
up and getting out of the way

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
where we just gently lay
our egoic mind as it were

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
any expectations by the way
and then just open ourselves,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
open our awareness to
receive what comes through,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and, of course, that can be
done with intention as well.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But the key thing is that
we say thank you to our ego

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.930 align:middle line:90%
and park it quietly by the side.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.725 align:middle line:90%
And then so much is open to us.

00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe there's
any difference between remote

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
viewing and astral
projection because, again,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I think it's someone has started
one trajectory of thought

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and process and named it this
or that but really it's all

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.450 align:middle line:90%
We're moving our mind.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:36.325 align:middle line:90%
It's all about the mind.

00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The lines get really
blurred when we talk about

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.320 align:middle line:84%
the differences of
astral projection,

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.510 align:middle line:84%
out-of-body experiences,
remote viewing,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and channeling because they are
very similar and they require

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.180 align:middle line:84%
one to access similar
states of consciousness.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So you could look
at remote viewing

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:55.030 align:middle line:84%
as a kind of channeling
in that one is channeling

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
the field of consciousness,
and as we remote viewers

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
are typically given
coordinates or objects

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:84%
for the field of consciousness
to locate for them

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
and then bring the imagery
into their awareness.

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So you could very much see
it as a kind of channeling.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When I remote view
a specific land mass,

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I will arc my mind over
to it, and it just goes

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:90%
as if it's an airplane.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Think of an airline route
map, and I just move my mind

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:84%
across that arc and
into the area that

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
is calling me the loudest.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
There's usually a central
point that I enter into.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And I always look
at the macro as

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
if I'm looking at a plot
of land in a diagram.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's that real to me.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.500 align:middle line:84%
It's in my mind, but
it's also in front of me.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard for someone
probably to understand,

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
but that's the best
way I can say it.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:84%
It's in my mind's
eye, but it's also

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.700 align:middle line:84%
as if I'm looking right at it
on the floor in front of me

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.080 align:middle line:84%
because I often look at the
floor, a blank, beige carpet,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:84%
while I'm doing
my work so I don't

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.715 align:middle line:84%
have any visual
distractions around me.

00:22:06.715 --> 00:22:12.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Remote viewing is your spirit
traveling to wherever it is

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:90%
that you want to see.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now most people don't
understand that spirit

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
travels all the time.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.220 align:middle line:90%
It travels all the time.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just that you are
not the best travel agent

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:84%
for your spirit because you're
unaware of where it's traveling

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.070 align:middle line:84%
to, why it's traveling there,
and what it's-- and the fact

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.480 align:middle line:90%
that it's even left.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
people don't understand

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that remote viewing
means that you have what

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.650 align:middle line:84%
are called-- what is
called spectral viewing.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.450 align:middle line:84%
It means that your spirit is
able to see what is happening

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:46.660 align:middle line:84%
in all levels of
dimensional space

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and transmit that energy
back to your prefrontal lobe

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you're able to see that
information in your embodiment.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
When people get deja vu, that's
because the spirit already

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.380 align:middle line:84%
traveled there and then
your body goes there

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, oh,
what is this feeling.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.160 align:middle line:90%
I think I've been here before.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have, just
not in the physical.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Your spirit traveled
there, and that's

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.045 align:middle line:84%
why you're feeling that because
you were there in spirit form.

00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Whatever word humanity
creates for this mysterious

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:84%
guiding force within us, the
evidence is mounting that

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful way to
connect with our inner guidance

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:40.521 align:middle line:84%
and the spirit world is uniting
our heart with our mind.

00:23:40.521 --> 00:23:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we put spirituality
in this whole other realm,

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:84%
or with channeling, it's we have
this perception that everything

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
spiritual and wonderful is out
in some other dimension but I

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.630 align:middle line:84%
really think it's about
recognizing the heaven that is

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.570 align:middle line:84%
here instead of trying to
get to some other place.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And we are the portal.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
We are that channel
and that bridge.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>> We all fundamentally
have intuition,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and when we're prepared to
hear and listen to those little

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
voices of intuition, intuitive
guidance, to follow them.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:30.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in my experience for
over 65 years, when I do,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:84%
the universe meets me in this
most glorious way and guides

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
me onwards and always,
always to my benefit,

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
always to my well
being and whole being.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So paying attention and
hearing and listening

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:49.015 align:middle line:90%
are intuitive insights.

00:24:49.015 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:10%
>> In order to wake up fully
to what you are and who

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.080 align:middle line:10%
you're here to be, meditation is
key because meditation is about

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.600 align:middle line:10%
watching the antics
of your mind.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's what you
learn from that.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.790 align:middle line:90%
It goes over here.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.590 align:middle line:90%
It goes over there.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:90%
It goes everywhere.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
learn to watch it,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.320 align:middle line:90%
you become a great observer.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And with that observation
you gain discernment.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And with that discernment,
you gain compassion.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:19.150 align:middle line:84%
You gain this neutrality
that will keep your ego back

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.280 align:middle line:84%
in the corner reading
a magazine while you're

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
doing the important
work of your life.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And so in order to have
the accuracy that I've

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.080 align:middle line:84%
developed over the years,
I've had to meditate,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.150 align:middle line:90%
and I haven't had to.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Let me wind that back.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.130 align:middle line:90%
I haven't had to.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I've chosen to because
I see the benefit of it.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because without that,
the mind's unstable,

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and to do medical intuitive work
or any type of spiritual giving

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and offering of
yourself to the world,

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:90%
you have to have a stable mind.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to know where
it's going to go,

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.710 align:middle line:84%
what is going to show up with,
what it's going to say to you.

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to try and
twist your own inner words,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.590 align:middle line:90%
and you have to understand that.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And meditation is
the key for that.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:07.522 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:11.450 align:middle line:10%
>> The eyes are visions.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:10%
The reality of the
atoms and molecules that

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:10%
exist within the eye, that
vision now is far different,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.530 align:middle line:10%
and yet there is no disagreement
between your official relatives

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:10%
and those unofficial relatives
that sometimes sneak through.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:44.000 align:middle line:90%
