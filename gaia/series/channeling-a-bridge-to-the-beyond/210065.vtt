00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Millions of us are waking up
now to an ability to experience

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:10%
more than the perceptions
of the five senses.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.720 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning to
sense ourselves as part

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:90%
of a larger tapestry of life.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
You could say you become
a person of the heart.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what will you do

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:90%
with your expanded perception?

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:10%
>> In 1989, Gary Zukav
released his powerful book,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:10%
"The Seat of the Soul," which
went on to become the number

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:10%
one New York Times
bestseller for 31 weeks.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Millions were inspired
to begin their search

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
within for this mysterious
place of connection

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:90%
that he so brilliantly named.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Other cultures
throughout history

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.780 align:middle line:84%
have simply referred to
this mysterious access

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.620 align:middle line:90%
point as the center.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Is the heart the central
station within us

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to hear,
see, and feel messages

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:90%
from beyond this dimension?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart is the sacred
space of the human being.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything, all energy, travels
in the blood through the heart

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
and in circulation to
the entirety of the body,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.670 align:middle line:90%
does it not?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:10%
So the seat of the soul is
there informing, if you would,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:10%
all things physical,
emotional, psychological.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>> The heart really is
the seat of the soul.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:10%
It is the place
literally, literally

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.250 align:middle line:10%
within the cells
of your heart where

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.250 align:middle line:10%
your destiny and your skills
and your talents and your gifts

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:10%
are embedded.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Within those cells,
every heartbeat

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.670 align:middle line:84%
you have holds an intention
to do your greatest

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:90%
gifts on this planet.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient traditions teach us
that the human body has seven

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
major energy
centers, or chakras.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
In modern times, each
chakra is commonly

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
associated with a
different color.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And the green one in the
center corresponds to rhythm,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:90%
compassion, empathy, and unity.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Once discovered, an
individual's ability

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to channel information from
beyond their five senses

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:90%
becomes highly charged.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we open
our hearts to guidance

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:90%
from beyond our minds?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.530 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:10%
>> We believe that this was
the central intelligence.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:10%
And this was just there to
give you information and direct

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.860 align:middle line:10%
you and hold space, but this
is the central intelligence.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Until we as a species
began to evolve

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
our emotional intelligence, our
awareness of heart connection

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and how the intelligence
of our heart

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.840 align:middle line:84%
is actually giving us
a different projection

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:84%
of our universal
space from a much more

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
integrated understanding of both
the inner and outer dimensions

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.390 align:middle line:90%
existing in one experience.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why ancient shamans
always say, don't go

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.190 align:middle line:90%
to your mind for your wisdom.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Go to your heart.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:10%
>> When we start the
path of spirituality,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.690 align:middle line:10%
the first thing that everyone
says is you have to get rid

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:10%
of the ego.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The ego is the one
that has been helping

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
you to survive for millions
of years on this planet.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:10%
So when we speak
about channeling,

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.800 align:middle line:10%
which is letting other
energies go through me,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:10%
the ego says, wait a moment,
but is this going to kill me?

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:90%
So you cannot get rid of ego.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.900 align:middle line:90%
That's dying.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is not leave
it in control of everything.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.250 align:middle line:84%
That's why everyone talks
about going to the heart.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart doesn't
judge what it's going through.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And the heart basically is
channeling in every bit.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the system of the heart has
been designed for channeling.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Blood goes through,
oxygen, vitamins-- anything

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that the cells
need to survive go

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.160 align:middle line:84%
through the channel
of the heart.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.040 align:middle line:84%
That's why, spiritually, we can
say we need to go to the heart

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.365 align:middle line:84%
in order to let us set free
from the ego and be more free.

00:05:06.365 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:10%
>> Within the opening of
the heart and the practice

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:10%
of service, not
just the intention,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:10%
this is where you dissipate
all barricades that you have

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.940 align:middle line:10%
created through
your own perception.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Each of you would simply
listen now in the quiet

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.505 align:middle line:10%
of your own mind to the
music of your own cells.

00:05:48.505 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.060 align:middle line:84%
You would know that
the atoms within you

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.104 align:middle line:84%
speak with a joy,
a full exaltation.

00:06:02.104 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Channeling, as the
way I'm describing it,

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.720 align:middle line:10%
is a much broader umbrella term.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It is this process of accessing
information and energy that's

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.110 align:middle line:84%
not limited by our conventional
notions of time and space

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and can appear receptive
and also expressive.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
From the scientific perspective,
there's still so much

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.260 align:middle line:84%
that we don't know about what
the source is, how it works--

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
these detailed aspects to
the mechanisms of channeling.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was growing up, I used
to compare us like if we are

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
cell phones, like a device,
and there are many software,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and many apps, and many programs
that you have to download from

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:90%
the internet.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
You can share data.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:90%
You can share information.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You can share messages
and these kind of things.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that channeling is
like being open to the Wi-Fi.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.220 align:middle line:84%
All this information, all this
data, and all these people

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:84%
with their own
devices can send data

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and you can receive them like
WhatsApp messages or something

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.190 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.310 align:middle line:84%
You just can grab all
the ideas that they

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
are trying to share it to
you just as a message--

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.970 align:middle line:84%
not need to put
the system inside.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Our actual technology
helped me to understand

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.690 align:middle line:84%
that when we are
channeling it's not always

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that a person comes
within you, but that you

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.690 align:middle line:84%
are tuning yourself
like in a radio

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:90%
to listen to their message.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Because the universe
works like waves.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
All the time, it's like waves
of vibration everywhere.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:10%
So anything that we
say, anything that we do

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.570 align:middle line:10%
creates a wave of information
that gets stuck in the stones,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.260 align:middle line:10%
in the trees, and other
people, in the whole network.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you go to some
place, that information

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
is still there.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So you can access
to that information

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:84%
if you set yourself in the
same frequency, like a radio.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.981 align:middle line:84%
This is how some
people will channel.

00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Let the wisdom of those
who are the wise ones and have

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
the answers in disguise to
be so, here, with a question.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> A radio works by tuning to a
specific frequency that matches

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
the frequency of the
signal being broadcast.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if our heart
was our radio dial,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.330 align:middle line:84%
connecting us to a powerful
vibrational highway

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of frequencies.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll describe it like
you listening to the radio.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And you have to tune to
a particular frequency

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
to not have static for the
message to come through.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:90%
So it's an attunement--

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:48.550 align:middle line:84%
a matching of frequency to
allow the communication.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Our perspective is that we're
blending with that frequency.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:01.740 align:middle line:84%
We're aligning it, just
like the dial on your radio.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.555 align:middle line:84%
If we did not do that
adjustment, if you would,

00:10:06.555 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:84%
you would only have static
and no communication.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
The best we can describe
in your experience

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand, for we
do not have the vocabulary,

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
nor do you have a vision
in your life experience

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.380 align:middle line:84%
to align with how
we could explain it.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
That creates an issue of
description, doesn't it?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In the stormy sea of
electromagnetic, cellular,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
Wi-Fi, radar, and
radio waves around us,

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
what other channels
are we picking up?

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
When our mind is
chaotic and stressed,

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
it causes static
in the connection

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:90%
to the frequency highway.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.160 align:middle line:10%
But when our minds are calm,
detached from thoughts,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:10%
and completely focused
in the present moment,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.040 align:middle line:10%
the brain has more power
to convert and translate

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.070 align:middle line:10%
these waves into
vibrational patterns

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.635 align:middle line:10%
and amplified as spoken words.

00:11:12.635 --> 00:11:15.420 align:middle line:10%


00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.290 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a persistent question
as to whether everyone has

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:10%
the ability to receive
extra-physical data,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:10%
or whether it's something
that belongs to the X-Men,

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, or limited numbers
of the human population.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:90%
It depends upon circumstance.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It depends upon
whether the individual

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
is able to step outside
of all the massive stimuli

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that we're bombarded with,
which is a particular issue

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.570 align:middle line:90%
in the 21st century.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Since the dawn of humanity,
there have been tales

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:84%
of mystics and magicians
living in secret

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:84%
because of their powerful
and unexplainable gifts.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Various skeptics
throughout history

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
have put these people into
different categories--

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
freaks, heretics, possessed,
witches, fortune-tellers.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on and on.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
With all the different
ways these humans accessed

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and expressed this information
from beyond their senses,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
several forms of channeling have
been developed and practiced.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
>> People who channel
actually use different types

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of channeling.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.330 align:middle line:84%
I think we're putting ourselves
in a box when we say, OK,

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
you're only a trance
channel and that's

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:84%
the only type of
channeling that you do.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
That has not been my
personal experience

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and it's not my
experience when I

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:84%
talk to the hundreds
of people who connect

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.880 align:middle line:90%
with me about their phenomenon.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they tune
in through what

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
you might call general
extrasensory perception.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they
do trance channeling.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's precognition.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:90%
We get stuck on these terms.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And we want to
put them in boxes.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Our human mind wants to be able
to characterize things and put

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.100 align:middle line:90%
boundaries on it all.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.480 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
they blur together.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't have
clear boundaries.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at its core is
this concept of non-local

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, and that we're
more than our physical brain--

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
that we have access to much
more than we think we do.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And it shows up in
these different ways

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that are often unique to the
individual who's doing it.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a number
of "clairs"--

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:10%
the word clair meaning
clear in French.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Clairvoyance-- clear-seeing,
meaning those people

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
who have a real skill with
being able to visualize or see

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.150 align:middle line:90%
images.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.510 align:middle line:90%
My favorite is claircognizance--

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:90%
clear-knowing.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
That, I think, is really
the hallmark of the oracle,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is receiving that
Divine Sophia oracle wisdom,

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.010 align:middle line:84%
getting it stimulated
within yourself,

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.640 align:middle line:84%
and then delivering
it out to others.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:10%
>> As human beings, we are
actually born with our clair

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.710 align:middle line:10%
senses, like clairvoyance-- the
ability to see subtle energy.

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Clairaudience, the ability
to hear subtle energy.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
Mental mediumship is another
word for claircognizance.

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.240 align:middle line:84%
This is your ability to
tune into, let's say,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.710 align:middle line:90%
cognitive information.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's information that is
organized, that is directed,

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that is like communication--
mathematics, maybe even

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.750 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Positioning of things--
spatial positioning--

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting
this information in.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you receive
this information in,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:90%
you still have to translate it.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.470 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you're getting
a mathematical model

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and you know nothing
about mathematics.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're channeling
this information

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:84%
through writing down
the metaphors of what's

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
coming through.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
that's what channeling

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:90%
is is this claircognizance.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:05.790 align:middle line:84%
You become this open conduit
of receiving subtle information

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that your mind, your
brain connection

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
is interpreting that
as linear information.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And then it comes through
as a conversation.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
It comes through as
automatic writing.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
You become the medium for which
that information flows through.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
You become that
channel through which

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:90%
the information comes through.

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a Windbridge research
medium from the Windbridge

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.590 align:middle line:10%
Research Center, who
scientifically tests

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.610 align:middle line:10%
and studies mediums and
mediumship for a lot

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:10%
of different purposes, but
education is one of the big

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.850 align:middle line:10%
ones.

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:10%
The mediumship is
like channeling.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like it's fed to me
or pipelined in to me.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm not reaching out for it.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:90%
It's coming to me.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.050 align:middle line:90%
I don't let them inside my body.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking to them mentally.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a mental medium.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I call
it a quickening,

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
where all of a sudden,
I just go through--

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:90%
I can connect.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I know everything.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.265 align:middle line:90%
And I can just spit it out.

00:16:00.265 --> 00:16:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And it comes so fast
and rapid and I'm

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.770 align:middle line:90%
saying it without thinking.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:90%
There's no chance to edit.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I essentially
learned mediumship,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:10%
which is what I would describe
as having a three-way call,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:10%
or-- hold on, let me ask.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
You get the information
and then you relay it.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And the way that I describe
channeling is you're

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:90%
essentially becoming the mic.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.360 align:middle line:84%
So then there's not
that lapsed time.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It is the notion of
which we are sharing, yes?

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
So there is an idea that
one is able to connect.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there is the
feeling of connection

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that lives beyond the
thinking practical mind.

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, it is, more or less,
getting out of the way as much

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:84%
as possible to literally
become the mic so that a stream

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.620 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness can
speak through you,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:90%
be it through writing or voice.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I was described by scientists
as a direct voice trance

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:90%
medium.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't until
several years later

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.710 align:middle line:10%
that the terminology
of channeling

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:10%
was even used as a
term for what I do.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
And I kept getting guidance,
and others as well.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I was tested
for my psychic ability.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
What it did for me is--
you're not a crazy person.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:90%
You're psychic.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Which was, at that time, a
nice "Good Housekeeping" seal

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:90%
of approval.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Because when I started doing
this work, it wasn't spoken of.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go into public
situations or parties

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and go, guess what I can do?

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Because people were terrified
of anything psychic.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:90%
Curious, but it wasn't a term.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.400 align:middle line:90%
Today, you hear it all the time.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:84%
You hear it in movies and TV
and across lunch counters.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's something of
great interest now.

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But that's the evolution
of consciousness as well.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:10%
>> I recognize that there are
many different disciplines

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.240 align:middle line:10%
within metaphysics,
within spirituality.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.590 align:middle line:90%
There can be remote viewing.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:24.850 align:middle line:90%
There can be medical healing.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:25.850 align:middle line:90%
There can be channeling.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
There can be mediumship--
on and on and on.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:84%
But I understand from
Bashar that it's just

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
different ways of expressing
the same mechanism.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
all about resonance.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It's all about frequency.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It's all about tapping into
a certain vibration that

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.790 align:middle line:90%
represents that expression.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So a medium is, in essence,
doing the same thing

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:90%
that I'm doing when I channel.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:10%
But I'm focused on
connecting to what

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:10%
appears to be another
dimensional being.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.030 align:middle line:10%
Mediums are
classically focused on

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:10%
what appeared to be
spirits of people that

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.080 align:middle line:10%
are connected to the Earth.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.310 align:middle line:10%
So it's just like, again,
having a television set.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're going, OK, well,
I'm watching this program

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.330 align:middle line:84%
over here, and now
I'm going to switch

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.680 align:middle line:90%
to this program over here.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.930 align:middle line:90%
The same mechanism-- the TV--

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:90%
is allowing you to do that.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.830 align:middle line:84%
But you're changing frequencies
to get a different story,

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.020 align:middle line:84%
a different program, a
different way of approaching

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
what's happening-- what's
coming out of that television.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And so it's this beautiful
spectrum ranging from intuition

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:10%
and hunches that probably
everyone has experienced

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:10%
at some point in their life
to mediumship and trance

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:10%
channeling, and precognition,
and clairvoyance,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.200 align:middle line:10%
and clairaudience, and all the
different terms that we apply

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:10%
to this experience of accessing
information beyond our five

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.320 align:middle line:10%
senses that I think most humans
have experienced on some level.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And so I consider
trance-channeling to be

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:84%
one slice of this human
experience of channeling

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.970 align:middle line:84%
>> If someone is willing to
simply allow themselves to fall

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:07.090 align:middle line:84%
into the resonant vibration
necessary to deliver

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:84%
information in a channeled
way, then the idea is that

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
they're already in
the perfect frequency,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
in the perfect vibration.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And everything is focused
that way, by definition,

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.260 align:middle line:84%
because that's all that exists
on that frequency level.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else can happen while
you're in that state of being.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing outside of that
frequency can occur.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call
that a trance, you may.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not technically what
most people on your planet

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.020 align:middle line:84%
think of when you
use the word trance.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.650 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that I was
challenged by when I first

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:43.000 align:middle line:84%
started in this field was there
were so many different terms

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
that were being applied to these
often ineffable experiences.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.710 align:middle line:84%
I would say
mediumship to someone

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
and I would mean one
thing-- and say, no, no,

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.090 align:middle line:84%
mediumship is this
other thing, or you

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:90%
should say mental mediumship.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.000 align:middle line:90%
No, that's physical mediumship.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:90%
No, that's trance-channeling.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.580 align:middle line:90%
No, that's possession.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.800 align:middle line:84%
And we'd go round
and round in circles

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:84%
with these different terms
and different definitions.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think all of
that-- remote viewing

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.780 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so forth--
is just all about getting

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
into the right frequency
that is representative

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
of the information
that you're seeking.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
is about resonance.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, even
positions in space, positions

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.550 align:middle line:84%
in time, other
dimensions are all

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
about being on a
certain frequency.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:10%
And if you can train yourself
to get into that frequency,

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:10%
you will automatically
receive the information

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:37.540 align:middle line:10%
that is commensurate
with that frequency.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> For some, working in the
darker arts can be a lonely

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Refining gifts of mediumship has
remained highly controversial.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning, I had a
very close friend that would

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:90%
sit with me.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But that was just to
be a support to me.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:90%
And she had interests.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:90%
But no, I didn't have anybody.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I had more resistance.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Out of fear, really.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Because like I said,
when I opened up,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:84%
people were afraid of
this kind of thing.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And the film industry has
really built on that fear

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.740 align:middle line:90%
with all the horror films.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:10%
And something's going to get
you-- that kind of thing.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.970 align:middle line:90%
So people had a real aversion.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of fear that I was

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:84%
going to know something
about them that they

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.860 align:middle line:90%
didn't want me to know.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.460 align:middle line:90%
We all have the shame feelings.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And so people were
afraid of that, too--

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
were afraid of me, because they
thought they couldn't hide.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:90%
And that still happens today.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I always could see
things as a child.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And people in my
family and neighbors

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:84%
would say, Laura,
come over here.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.405 align:middle line:90%
You've got hot hands.

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Would you put your
hand on my shoulder?

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:90%
It hurts.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was seven and eight and
I didn't know any different.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're loving
people, so sure.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that feels so much better.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.880 align:middle line:84%
I had shut everything
down at 16 based

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.670 align:middle line:84%
on a very powerful
mystical experience

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I had with another young
woman on a college campus.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
And when we shared
it with other people,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.060 align:middle line:90%
they thought the normal things.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
We were crazy,
seeking attention,

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.630 align:middle line:84%
what have you been
smoking, things like that.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.520 align:middle line:84%
But I was not into drugs,
alcohol, or cigarettes

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.120 align:middle line:90%
at the age of 16.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:90%
So I shut down.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm going to
expose myself like that again.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I was open as a kid.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't too jolting.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.293 align:middle line:84%
But like us all, I learned
how to just shut it down.

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
If things are happening
and other people

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.590 align:middle line:84%
aren't seeing them, you're
like, OK, best case,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.170 align:middle line:90%
I shut that down.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What if everyone made
it their mission to live

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.710 align:middle line:84%
their life through the guidance
of their hearts and use

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.480 align:middle line:84%
their minds as a powerful
tool to translate the messages

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:90%
and see the visions?

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> When you go to the heart, you
just let yourself be permeable

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to all these other realities,
because the heart is open

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:84%
to channel all the time and
to nourish all the body.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things I'd like
you to consider is to not give

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:31.890 align:middle line:90%
up on your gifts.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't hide them anymore.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
calling inside of you--

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.560 align:middle line:90%
because it is a calling.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It's not an ego thing
that says, oh, I'm

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:84%
going to be the world's
greatest healer.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.870 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to make
it with that driving you.

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a calling inside
to help humanity.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.400 align:middle line:90%
And we all are here to serve.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:84%
That is what we are here to
do, no matter your capacity.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.850 align:middle line:84%
It's not about your job or
education or occupation.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.920 align:middle line:90%
We are here to serve each other.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And we each have these
unique gifts inside of us,

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:84%
literally, again, within
the cells of your heart.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:90%
The heart knows the way--

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.480 align:middle line:90%
they say that for a reason.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> A part of your existence
requires discovering new

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:84%
things, new perspectives
about yourself.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are only certain
kinds of conditions

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.610 align:middle line:84%
in which those kinds of
discoveries can be made.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.440 align:middle line:84%
Physical reality
being one of them,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.290 align:middle line:84%
because you impose the
framework of time and space

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.950 align:middle line:84%
on your consciousness, to a
certain degree, to, in a sense,

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:84%
forget who you are as a
greater being in order

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.660 align:middle line:84%
to remember who you
are, or rediscover

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
who you are, but from a fresh
perspective and point of view.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you grow as
a being, as a consciousness.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>> The authenticity of every
individual sharing their unique

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:54.500 align:middle line:84%
truth to the world is a
gift that elevates all.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So we would encourage each and
every one to use the gifts that

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:08.510 align:middle line:84%
are unique to them, to
share them in the world--

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:84%
the sharing is what
is important as well--

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.540 align:middle line:84%
for there is this tapestry
of human existence

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:84%

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.240 align:middle line:90%

the volume down on their gifts
