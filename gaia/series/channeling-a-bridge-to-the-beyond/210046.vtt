itself as an extraterrestrial

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:10%
And that what's happening
here is a telepathic contact

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:10%
between him and
myself that allows

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:10%
me to function as a channel
for him as a translation device

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.140 align:middle line:10%
to bring through his
information to humans on Earth.

>> When I started channeling,
it was beings that were close

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Like more spirits.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:10%
But eventually, it came up
to be many other beings.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Beings that were
alive in other places.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Also beings that are not alive,
but they were not dead neither.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So that changed completely
my understanding

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:90%
of what was channeling.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And so my body was
being worked on.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And then when Theo came
in, then Orlos says,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the higher teachers
are here now.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.050 align:middle line:84%
When Theo first came in
and I was laying down,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and they were so loud.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I felt in my body as
they came in the right side is,

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
you know when you hit
your elbow and you

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:90%
have that tingling sensation?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not very comfortable.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.670 align:middle line:84%
My whole upper body did that
when they first came in.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:90%
And it was like, oh, wow.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.830 align:middle line:84%
When they came in, they
said, we are 12 archangels,

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and we can be known
collectively by the name Theo.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And they said, we will
not identify singularly,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.930 align:middle line:84%
because it is not the
messenger that is important,

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:90%
it is the message.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
So they've never
identified who the 12 are.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea, but I'm--

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
you know, they've not
told me specifically.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.240 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:10%

state in the channeling class

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.260 align:middle line:10%
that I took and the connection
happened between me and Bashar,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.890 align:middle line:10%
that word "Bashar" was just
there in the connection.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.200 align:middle line:10%
And I think it had to
happen at that moment.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Because Bashar is an Arabic
word I found out much later,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:90%
because I don't speak Arabic.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:10%
But it is half of my background.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:10%
Bashar is a physical being.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Though he has evolved
to the point where

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:10%
he's very close to
becoming non-physical.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.050 align:middle line:10%
But he does have some of
the abilities of spirit

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.360 align:middle line:10%
to see into other dimensions.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:10%
So he is definitely
seeing multidimensionally.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.505 align:middle line:10%
And that's kind of
their natural state.

00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:90%


00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.140 align:middle line:10%

allowed you to create.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.805 align:middle line:90%
Be the question.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.900 align:middle line:84%
>> There are some of them that
take a lot of energy to be

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.100 align:middle line:90%
channeled.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:84%
But there is other beings that
you can just listen to them

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
or feel them and you
understand whatever

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:90%
they are trying to say.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's no even need
for them to be inside you

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:90%
or to speak through you.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
You just can translate them.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole spectrum of
different ways of channeling.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:90%

at the Institute

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.429 align:middle line:10%
The Ions Channeling Research
Program was my inspiration.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
So I hold the big
picture of the program

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and the principal

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
of the specific

around trance channeling.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.850 align:middle line:84%
As a child, young child, I
was really pretty sensitive.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.070 align:middle line:84%
I would feel people's emotions
when I walked into rooms.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
I would feel the
energy of the room.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I was really
sensitive to the dark

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:84%
because I could
feel what I thought

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:90%
were beings in the spaces.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And it caused a little bit
of anxiety for me as a child.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And I never really talked
to anybody about it.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
But as I grew older
and was connecting

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
with my mom and her
side of the family,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
that whole awareness
of this ability

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.990 align:middle line:84%
to experience things
beyond my five senses

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.040 align:middle line:90%
just expanded exponentially.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I think the major
triggering point

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:84%
for me was when I
was 10 years old.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And she took me to my
grandparents' house

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.200 align:middle line:90%
for what they called meetings.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was probably
like 30 people

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:90%
sitting around in a circle.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And my uncle was at
the top of that circle,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and he was speaking in this
completely bizarre, unique way.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It was my uncle there, but
it didn't look like him.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:90%
His words weren't the same.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:84%
His voice,
mannerisms, everything

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
was completely different.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So as this young
10-year-old, it was scary.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I was nervous that
whatever was in my uncle

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
was going to jump into
me, and that I was

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
going to start doing something.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It was exciting, too,
because it felt important.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
My uncle continued to do
this trance channeling work.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.950 align:middle line:84%
And he believed he was
channeling something

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.345 align:middle line:90%
called the universal mind.

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Universal mind.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Source.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.010 align:middle line:90%
God.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Cosmic consciousness.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is named the
source of all life.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
Many different things over
the course of history.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Developing countless
practices and strategies

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:84%
to connect with this
divine source of wisdom

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Is there an ultimate energy
source that everyone taps into?

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Like a central hub where all
information flows in and out.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a place where everyone,
everywhere, every dimension,

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
everything is connected to.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Many ancient cultures
have at their heart the idea,

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the principle, of there being
a universal mind in which all

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.690 align:middle line:90%
of us participate.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
So for example, within
hermetic philosophy,

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:84%
there's frequent reference
to something called nous,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:50.600 align:middle line:84%
or an infinite or
universal mind.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Within Vedic philosophy,
references made to something

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.090 align:middle line:84%
called akasha, which
in a Western context,

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the earliest such references
appeared in the book

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
"Isis Unveiled," which was
published in 1877 by Madame

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
H.P. Blavatsky, a
world-traveled Russian occultist

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.350 align:middle line:84%
and religious
spiritual visionary.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
She wrote that there exists
this ethereal substance that

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:84%
records and preserves for
eternity all human events,

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
all human thoughts,
all human interactions.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And starting at that
point, that term

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:84%
really began to enter
into our common vocabulary

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and entered into
Western culture.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything is here and now.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.020 align:middle line:10%
Everything is all connected.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:10%
It's not a particular
place you have to go.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
It can be accessed from
anywhere, anywhere, any time.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just the idea that all
information never goes away.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.400 align:middle line:90%
It's all here and now.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.990 align:middle line:90%
It cannot be destroyed.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:90%
It cannot cease to exist.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you are the frequency
of a particular piece

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.160 align:middle line:84%
of information, that's
the kind of information

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.850 align:middle line:84%
that will, so to speak,
pop into your awareness.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Because information is
accessible from anywhere,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.060 align:middle line:90%
any time, any place.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:10%
>> The best way to describe
in human knowledge a certain

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.510 align:middle line:10%
record keeping, it is not
a library of books held

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.130 align:middle line:10%
somewhere.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:31.210 align:middle line:84%
But it is information
that is in the soul, that

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
is a continuum, that is resonant
in each cell of your body.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So the record is held
there within your being.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Your human experience
is the Earth suit

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
that you've chosen to
navigate this planet.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And so the soul enters
this Earth suit.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.720 align:middle line:10%
It has cells which the
soul permeates all of them.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is where the records
are held in all those cells.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:10%
But more importantly, in
the energy of the soul

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.110 align:middle line:10%
that is eternal.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.970 align:middle line:84%
You can speak of it as one's
multidimensionality and

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:21.400 align:middle line:90%
vibrational frequency.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Your universal self cannot be
found within the thinking mind.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:84%
This is just meant
to process, yes.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:90%
To process, to receive.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:90%
Process.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
Transmit.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
You have learned this
through the internet.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Look at the way that
you have expanded

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.930 align:middle line:90%
through your technology.

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
As you used to get
news maybe months,

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.290 align:middle line:84%
years from somebody on the
other side of the world.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you have a phone
conversation with them, yes?

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So it is becoming
more available.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And so is your connection
to this universe mind

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:90%
through your higher mind.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you are looking
for this universal mind,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
would you not connect
with your universal self?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Channeling Bashar for so
long now, almost 39 years,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of his philosophy,
a lot of his perspective,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
has sort of rubbed off on me.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
He refers to what we might
call universal mind or God

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or goddess, all that
is, as all that is.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Literally it's existence
itself that is self-aware,

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.040 align:middle line:90%
that is intelligent.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's intelligent on
a very different level

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:84%
than we understand what
that expression is.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.260 align:middle line:84%
He basically is saying
it's only one thing,

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
and we're all a part of it.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
nothing outside of it.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.300 align:middle line:84%
But from his perspective,
the one thing

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.310 align:middle line:84%
itself, whatever you want
to call it, is beyond that.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Time is a concept within it,
it's not subject to time.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Many traditions and
philosophies have spoken about

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:10%
a higher self, or oversoul.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.300 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.620 align:middle line:84%
>> We have one self, which is
the one with the brain that is

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.220 align:middle line:90%
trying to survive.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the self with
a body and emotion.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:34.840 align:middle line:84%
The one that we call the ego,
which is I. And the higher self

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:84%
is actually the essence
that created us.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:84%
That made us be
what we are today.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:90%
So it's our real me.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
the higher self,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
it's not someone
superior to you.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:90%
It's basically you.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:10%
The actual you.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.620 align:middle line:10%
Talking to one tiny
side of itself.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.120 align:middle line:90%
That is, one ego.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
So when you connect
with your higher self,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
you can see things very
clear, because it doesn't

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.740 align:middle line:90%
have any time, any space.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
It's not limited by your ego.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I do believe in the soul.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:10%
I do believe in the spirit.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:10%
And to me, they're
two different things.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And the higher self is, to
me, another term for the soul.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I think they're interchangeable.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
When we start to wake up,
those first awakened moments,

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.770 align:middle line:84%
we remember that there's
something outside of ourself,

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:90%
something bigger than ourselves.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it
starts as little kids,

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.830 align:middle line:90%
or it may happen when you're 47.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter the
age, it's going to happen.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But that's the first
sensation you get that there

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:90%
is a higher self, a soul.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's driving you.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It's animating you.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It's directing you.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And so the recognition of
that is really important.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
step to waking up.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:10%
>> In order for us to
understand the higher self from

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.043 align:middle line:10%
the perspective of how we
look at things shamanically,

00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:10.460 align:middle line:10%
the best way that we could say
it is that when people talk

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.120 align:middle line:10%
about the shadow self,
that's the higher self.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.880 align:middle line:84%
The higher self isn't
this illuminated being

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.390 align:middle line:84%
that's just sitting
there going, (VOCALIZES).

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.830 align:middle line:84%
The higher self is the part
of your spiritual essence

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
that is so liberated that
it is there to show you

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
where you are not
seeking for liberation.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Your true nature
is non-physical.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
We'll say spirit if you
wish to use that word.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:90%
You are all in spirit right now.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:90%
That's your natural state.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:90%
You never leave it.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.450 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you are only
dreaming that you've left.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.820 align:middle line:90%
That's what physical reality is.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:54.200 align:middle line:84%
So the so-called higher mind
is actually where most of you

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.510 align:middle line:84%
actually resides
as a consciousness,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.460 align:middle line:90%
as a greater being.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:84%
The idea of your physical
mind is an extension and not

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
a large percentage
of your total being.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans separate the selves
where there's no separation.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:10%
The highest self, the
oversoul, is all a part

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:10%
of your human experience.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:10%
The higher self is the sum
total of all your soul.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
The vibrational frequency
that is your soul.

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:90%
That has all that information.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.400 align:middle line:84%
As you speak of the
Akashic Records,

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:90%
it has all the information.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:84%
Your higher power,
you might say.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.250 align:middle line:84%
- Edgar Cayce, the early 20th
century medical clairvoyant,

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
gave us our portrait
of what we see

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:90%
when we think of channeling.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:58.220 align:middle line:84%
He would relax and go into
a sleep-like state or trance

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.570 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.550 align:middle line:84%
He would receive information
from an extra physical entity

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that he referred
to as the source.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>> When this started
happening with me,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:90%
this voice was coming out of me.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Then I started trying to
find something or someone

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.750 align:middle line:84%
that I could relate
my experience

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.000 align:middle line:90%
to to understand it more.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So the first book that I ever
found was an Edgar Cayce book.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And I started reading
it, and I thought, well,

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'm doing.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening to me.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce was an
influential source for me.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I would almost call
his style more of a trance.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Because he was known as
the sleeping prophet.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So he was an influence
in the sense of he

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:84%
was part of my education
of what channeling was.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce, his
soul or his messenger,

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.370 align:middle line:90%
connected to the individual.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:05.760 align:middle line:84%
It was like the highway to them
on a vibrational frequency.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.390 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a vibrational
highway system that can only be

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:90%
accessed within us?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:10%
That allows us to connect
to anyone, anywhere,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.825 align:middle line:10%
any time instantaneously?

00:21:20.825 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:84%
Our minds can be
highly influenced

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.800 align:middle line:90%
by outside vibrational forces.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.990 align:middle line:84%
But as we have learned
from most masters that

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
have walked this
planet before us,

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:84%
presence, practice, and
patience is a prerequisite

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:90%
to a powerful connection.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But what and who are
we connecting to?

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We are still taking just
a moment here to settle in.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I suppose a question
that we face is whether,

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:03.770 align:middle line:84%
in fact, we are communicating
with energies that exist

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.240 align:middle line:90%
outside of the individual.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
>> That we do not intervene or
interfere in certain aspects

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
of other civilizations.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Or whether the individual is
personifying some aspect of his

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:90%
or her own greater psyche.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:84%
>> When I channel, I try not
to get too attached to the idea

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that it is a certain
being or consciousness,

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:84%
even if I am calling
upon whatever it is--

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:90%
a Pleiadian or an angel.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It's all from this bank of
greater awareness, right?

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's all vibration and
resonance and reflection

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:42.750 align:middle line:90%
of truth.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Whatever comes in is in enough
resonance with your field.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And it exists for you
to expand through.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.960 align:middle line:84%
That's what I love about
channeling, is that it's felt

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and it hits.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's so unique
because it's not

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.270 align:middle line:84%
coming from this linear
information back and forth.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.560 align:middle line:84%
There's an actual
transmission happening.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.200 align:middle line:10%
>> I know the word channeling
can be somewhat polarizing.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.908 align:middle line:84%
But it is somewhat
representative of what

00:23:16.908 --> 00:23:17.708 align:middle line:90%
you're doing.

00:23:17.708 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:90%
You're acting as a conduit.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You're acting as a channel
to bring through information,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%
let's say, from a higher level.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Or from more connections
going on within the brain.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:10%
Because when you
are in that state,

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:10%
your brain is sort of
processing information

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:10%
in a very hyper fast way.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:10%
It's making connections
it doesn't normally make.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.850 align:middle line:10%
It's a very clear way of seeing
things and connecting things

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:45.170 align:middle line:10%
together.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can do this.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Everyone does do this.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.780 align:middle line:90%
>> We all channel energy.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We're channeling that
energy all the time.

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, someone who's
an artist, a painter,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:90%
is a channeler.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:90%
A musician is a channeler.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.965 align:middle line:90%
A writer is a channeler.

00:24:03.965 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:90%
A clairvoyant is a channeler.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just how they receive
information and bring it out.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> As soon as anyone gets into
a state where they're completely

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
absorbed, they are in
a channeling state.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.150 align:middle line:10%
>> You are not as
isolated as you may think.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people think
of, I want to be a channel,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:10%
don't realize they are already.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.570 align:middle line:84%
In whatever gifts
that they have that

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.900 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing
forth to the world.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:10%
>> Words like "channeling"
just get a bad rep.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:10%
They get put into a position,
and they stay there.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's unfortunately.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
That's a socially
constructed reality.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can't do much about
that except to educate people

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:52.880 align:middle line:84%
on the fact that when they
are in contemplative thought,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.140 align:middle line:84%
they may hear voices
other than their own.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.950 align:middle line:84%
>> As a witnesser of
trance channeling,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
it's so incredible to see the
transformation of someone that

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
you know so intimately to
essentially become a different

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.760 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And so now as the scientist,
I put my scientist hat on.

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And the question is
always, is this real?

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:90%
What's the source?

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Are they really channeling
a different being?

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.250 align:middle line:84%
From a personal
perspective, witnessing it,

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
there's no reason
for my family members

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.870 align:middle line:84%
to be making it up, manifesting
these incredibly different well

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.500 align:middle line:84%
developed personalities
one after the other.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
It just seems that the
probability of that being

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.450 align:middle line:90%
faked in some way is so slim.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And while I can't prove that
there's other beings that

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.970 align:middle line:84%
are coming in, the felt
sense in the moment

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not
the normal personality

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:90%
of my mother or my uncle.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And when we think about us being
all interconnected and all one,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's just another
aspect of themselves,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.170 align:middle line:84%
which is part of
this greater oneness.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.330 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Those who have experience
with it will understand.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Because it's experiential.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And so you will have many people
say, I know what that means.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Because they've experienced it.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And more and more and more
daily are having experiences

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:90%
for a greater understanding.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:90%
