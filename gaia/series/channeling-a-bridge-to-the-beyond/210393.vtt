have helped humanity through

There are legendary
tales from ancient Greece

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.845 align:middle line:84%
of the mystical
oracles at Delphi.

00:00:31.845 --> 00:00:35.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Through the rise and
fall of the Roman Empire,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.030 align:middle line:84%
the word "oracle"
was embedded deeply

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.880 align:middle line:84%
into the category
of occult and became

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.385 align:middle line:90%
a label instead of a gift.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
>> An oracle is basically an
interpretation of the data that

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
is out there.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Through thousands of
years, the people that

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.410 align:middle line:84%
were able to read reality and
to see the reality in a way

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.550 align:middle line:84%
that they can observe
everything before it happened,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
they became those people
that could advise others

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and to receive the data and
information from other levels,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.035 align:middle line:84%
so they became themselves
the interpreters of reality.

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Oracles are always giving
countercultural information.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:10%
If you think of some of the wild
things that many of the oracles

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:10%
have been saying over the past,
even 100 years, it's out there.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.730 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.735 align:middle line:90%
But it's part of the evolution.

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
the oracles are

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.380 align:middle line:84%
on the front line of bringing
forth this information,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it takes a while
to digest and metabolize.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.020 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, soon,
things seem normal that once

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.820 align:middle line:90%
weren't.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.492 align:middle line:84%
And now that we understand
that level of reality,

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:04.450 align:middle line:90%
then we can go further.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.742 align:middle line:84%
But the oracles are always
at the cutting edge of that,

00:02:06.742 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
so it's a thrilling profession,
and it's a dangerous profession

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.160 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.090 align:middle line:84%
The word "oracle" is really
what was used in ancient Greece

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.580 align:middle line:90%
in ancient times.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:84%
The oracle means at
least three things.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:90%
The oracle is a location.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a portal where the energies
are able to come through

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:90%
more easily.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.480 align:middle line:90%


00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The oracle is the person
or the spirit that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.740 align:middle line:84%
is transmitting
that information,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and the oracle is the message
that is being transmitted.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
things wrapped up

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:90%
into that term "oracle."

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.740 align:middle line:84%
In the West, the most
famous oracle center

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.260 align:middle line:90%
was that of Delphi in Greece.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:10%
There was an older
center as well,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:10%
known as the oracle of
Dodona, and there were

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.810 align:middle line:10%
oracles in Egypt, and so forth.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.800 align:middle line:10%
But somehow the
Delphic oracle has

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.243 align:middle line:10%
captured the
imagination of humanity

00:03:16.243 --> 00:03:17.535 align:middle line:10%
for a lot of different reasons.

00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:20.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.770 align:middle line:84%
>> In the ancient Greek
world, scholars, soldiers,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.820 align:middle line:84%
statesmen would visit
the oracle at Delphi.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:10%
And the physical experience
of visiting the oracle,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:10%
based on records that
we have, involved

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.590 align:middle line:10%
entering into a cavern
where a female oracle would

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:10%
be seated on a kind of tripod
above a crevice in the earth.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And this crevice would
emit some kind of vapor,

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and the oracle would be
imbibing these vapors, which

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.330 align:middle line:84%
facilitated a
trance state and was

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
said to be able to receive
information from the gods.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:10%
>> The oracle at Delphi is still
kind of an interesting mystery

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:10%
because we know that
these were seers,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.570 align:middle line:10%
just like we have in
the Norse tradition,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:10%
where they would sit
upon a raised platform,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:10%
just like in the
Norse tradition,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.710 align:middle line:10%
interestingly enough.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.430 align:middle line:84%
But the caves at Delphi have
this interesting little gas,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.510 align:middle line:84%
this volcanic gas
that comes out.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, if you're
swamped in this gas

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and you're completely
inundated, it'll kill you.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you are elevated above
it and you're breathing it

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:84%
just slightly, it'll put
you into an altered state

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, an altered
state of being, which

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
will open you up to become a
conduit to let this information

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.600 align:middle line:90%
flow through.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Once a month, the
oracle would be given.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And so while it started out
as being this local situation

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.210 align:middle line:84%
where people were breathing
gases from a hole in the earth

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and starting to
prophesy, they were

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.550 align:middle line:84%
starting to give all
sorts of information.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
But there was a little
problem apparently

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.940 align:middle line:84%
in that they would tend
to fall into the hole,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.410 align:middle line:84%
or fall off a cliff,
or something like that.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:90%
So they tried to regulate this.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:10%
That's when they started
assigning women to this.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
>> There were different female
figures seated atop the tripod

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
in different eras because the
oracle of Delphi was operative

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.600 align:middle line:90%
for centuries.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So through some sort
of initiatory process

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.740 align:middle line:84%
that we have only
a vague idea of,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:84%
a figure named
Pythia, or Phthonus,

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.410 align:middle line:84%
would be selected as the oracle
during different generational

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.050 align:middle line:84%
periods and would
be the figure who

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
was seated atop this
tripod, receiving

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
this extraphysical or
trance state information.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So the individual personas
are lost to history,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:84%
but different women across
different generations

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.590 align:middle line:84%
would function in the
role of seer at Delphi.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a woman named
Themistoclea who was one

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:90%
of the Delphic pythias.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:90%
That was their title.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras took all of his
precepts from this woman.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.900 align:middle line:90%
He would sit at her feet.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we think he's
the father of geometry,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.030 align:middle line:84%
no, Themistoclea
was, along with many

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
of the other esoteric precepts
that he was all about,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:90%
the Pythagoreans.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:84%
There was an older
oracle named Herophile

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.490 align:middle line:84%
who would stand on this
particular rock at the site,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and she would deliver
these oracles in verse.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Can you imagine a kind of
a rhyming, cadenced verse?

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:90%
And there were others like this.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> We may or may not know
the entire intricacies

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of the entire practice, like how
they set up, how they dressed,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%
how they performed.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But what interests
me more is what's

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
going on at the
mental level, what's

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%
going on at the spiritual level.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And so all of
those accoutrements

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is nothing more than opening the
veil, getting their mind tuned

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
in to those
frequencies, which comes

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
through their spiritual
practice, their meditation.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:84%
All of their devotional works
before going into that rite

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.890 align:middle line:84%
tunes them into the
work that they're doing.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.580 align:middle line:84%
So you loosen, you're
open, you're connected,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately,
that's what they were

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.470 align:middle line:90%
doing at the Delphi oracle.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
>> We also know is that the
oracle went through a different

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
transition where the women
were originally channeling

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of Gaia
herself, Mother Earth.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And then there were different
types of deities or entities

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:84%
that ended up coming in
and taking over and being

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.440 align:middle line:84%
the intelligence that was
delivered through these women,

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
until ultimately what we
have is Apollo, the sun god.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.940 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very detailed and
intense history and process

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
of what would go on
with these women.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It seems that the
primary location

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
where they would receive the
information was in their wombs.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And what this was
understood to be

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.640 align:middle line:84%
was the spirit of the
god coming into the womb.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And the Christian writers
were horrified about this.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.698 align:middle line:84%
They would write,
and this was one

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which
they were trying

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of paganism and so
forth because they were saying,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:84%
look at what's going on at
Delphi, among other places.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, these
women would declare

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
themselves the celibate
wives, daughters,

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:41.804 align:middle line:90%
and sisters of Apollo.

00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:46.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's very fascinating and
mysterious when you start

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.250 align:middle line:90%
looking at this information.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
>> By the late 1500s, most
of the oracle traditions were

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.310 align:middle line:84%
labeled witchcraft
throughout England.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Queen Elizabeth I
was on the throne,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and Shakespeare plays
ruled the narrative.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Several speculate that her
Majesty's secret service was

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:90%
full of mysterious personas.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Some argue that
Shakespeare was also

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:20.660 align:middle line:84%
deeply entrenched with
this secret service

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and working closely
with one of the Queen's

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
main esoteric
advisors, Dr. John Dee.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:10%
Evidence is mounting that,
together, Dee and Shakespeare

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:37.770 align:middle line:10%
crafted an elaborate,
cryptographic masterpiece

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:10%
through sonnets
and plays that was

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:10%
meant to be discovered once
the Dark Ages had long passed.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:10%


00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most curious and
underrepresented characters

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:10%
of the whole Renaissance is
this character, Dr. John Dee,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:10%
who was, one can safely say,
the leading mathematician

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:10%
of the time, the
leading astrologer,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:10%
the leading cryptographer.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:84%
He was a spy for Her Majesty on
Her Majesty's secret service.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
His code number when he was
spying for her in Europe was

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:90%
007.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.060 align:middle line:84%
He's the person that is
working with Shakespeare

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to bring this wonderful
knowledge of unifying

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
the poetry and the math, all the
balancing, all the opposites,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
so that you're back into
unity consciousness.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.460 align:middle line:90%
That's true alchemy.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.050 align:middle line:90%
That's what Dee's goal was.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
He was dealing in
the occult, and he

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:84%
was dealing in trying to
communicate with angels,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.365 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't do
that 400 years ago.

00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he was under the
radar, trying to do that,

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.090 align:middle line:84%
because he truly
believed that he

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.310 align:middle line:84%
could bring about a
reformation of the world.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
He felt all the schisms between
Catholicism and Protestantism

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.690 align:middle line:84%
and Judaism and Islam and all
the world's major religions

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.590 align:middle line:90%
connecting.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.420 align:middle line:90%
They should be one.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:84%
They should be this
unity of the divine,

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and that was his true
ultimate purpose.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to bring
about this healing

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
through contact
with higher beings.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.020 align:middle line:90%
That was his means.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:23.700 align:middle line:84%
He thought, if I could
just speak to the angels,

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.300 align:middle line:90%
I can help the world heal.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Since he was not clairvoyant
or clairaudient himself,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
he needed a medium, which in
those days was called a scryer.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:84%
So this guy shows up on his
doorstep named Edward Kelley,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
and he's a good scryer.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.480 align:middle line:84%
He immediately starts
getting results,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.280 align:middle line:84%
looking into some sort of an
obsidian mirror or a crystal

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:90%
ball.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We don't know for
sure what it was.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
He impresses Dee right away
because he can see the angels.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And so begins about
a 10-year period

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:84%
where they are
scrying to the angels.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So Dee believes he's talking
with Uriel, Gabriel, Michael,

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:90%
and Raphael, four archangels.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.608 align:middle line:84%
And from the work that I've been
able to glean from the codes

00:12:18.608 --> 00:12:20.150 align:middle line:84%
that he's left, it's
absolutely clear

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
that he was because they
give codes that are utterly

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
unfailing in their brilliance
and their accuracy,

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:31.200 align:middle line:84%
and their precision
is mind-boggling.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It's just so beautiful, and
there's no other explanation

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
than that this was given
by divine providence

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to Dee through angelic beings.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:84%
In the middle of their
entire roller coaster

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:84%
ride of experimentation
with talking to angels,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
something is downloaded to Dee
called the Enochian Tables.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a grid of
four quadrants that

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:84%
were given to John Dee, a
massive, massive download

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in which Kelley is seeing flames
60-foot high, with the letters.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And he'd name a
letter, and Dee would

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.455 align:middle line:84%
write it down, and name another
letter and write it down.

00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
They told him the absolute grid
to put it into, 624 characters.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And it ends up being this
massive thing that had then

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.950 align:middle line:84%
been co-opted
through the centuries

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
later by Aleister Crowley,
The Golden Dawn, Israel

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Regardie, these names that are
in the esoteric modern era.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
It totally takes Dee
out of the picture.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.242 align:middle line:84%
They step in and say,
oh, Dee and Kelley

00:13:44.242 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:84%
didn't know what they
were talking about.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that was interesting.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:90%
We'll take it from here, fellas.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And they change it,
and they give you

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of added information,
and they turn the Enochian

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Tables into little
pyramids and colors,

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and it's completely different.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There are different versions
of the Enochian Tables.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
The 20th century magician Anton
LaVey used a kind of reformed

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or adapted Enochian language
in one of his books,

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and there are
different permutations,

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
just as there are different
permutations of the tree

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:90%
of life symbolism in Kabbalah.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:27.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout the Renaissance,
occult practices remained deep

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:90%
underground.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:84%
During the 1700s,
the Revolutionary War

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
raged in North America,
and the French Revolution

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.345 align:middle line:90%
was in full swing.

00:14:37.345 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Those in tune with their
extrasensory perceptions

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.960 align:middle line:84%
began gathering and enjoying
their newfound freedom

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.435 align:middle line:84%
to share and express
their healing gifts.

00:14:49.435 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Here in the United States,
when we think of new religious

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
movements, new trends, and
alternative spirituality,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
naturally people
think of California.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
But it was really New York
State in the early days

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of the nation that served as a
springboard for everything that

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
was novel and fresh
and experimental

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.050 align:middle line:90%
in religious movements.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
In particular, there was an
area in the early to mid 1800s

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
in central New
York State referred

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to as the Burned
Over District, which

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.390 align:middle line:84%
became the birthplace
of everything that

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
was new in religious
and social thought.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:10%
This was a snaking
stretch of land

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:38.250 align:middle line:10%
that was bordered by Buffalo
in the west and Albany

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:39.240 align:middle line:10%
in the east.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:10%
And it was opened up
to land speculation

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.180 align:middle line:10%
after the War of
Independence, and people

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:10%
flooded into the
Burned Over District,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.750 align:middle line:10%
and it became ground zero
for new congregations,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:10%
new movements.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
It was the birthplace
of Mormonism,

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of Seventh Day Adventism,
of spiritualism, or talking

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.480 align:middle line:84%
to the dead, of suffragism, and
the women's rights movement.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It gave birth to all
kinds of mystical figures,

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
mediums, channelers,
many of whom

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
really settled
central New York State

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
and dispersed different
religious ideas

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.350 align:middle line:90%
around the nation.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:10%
>> There is a very powerful
vortex connected to spirit

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:10%
in that area, and therefore,
there are certain places

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.430 align:middle line:10%
on your planet that
are more likely,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.090 align:middle line:10%
more probable than other places
because of those vortices

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.450 align:middle line:10%
for certain realizations and
cognitions to be awakened

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:10%
in humanity.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:10%
When you get enough
individuals of similar intent,

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:10%
shall we say, congregating
in some of those vortices,

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.800 align:middle line:10%
things can, in a
positive way, explode.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
You can amplify and magnify
that energy many times

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.920 align:middle line:90%
over within such a vortex.

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The Fox sisters are some of
the most influential figures

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
to emerge from the
Burned Over District.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Kate and Margaret Fox
were two adolescent girls

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.180 align:middle line:84%
who lived in a small village
outside of Rochester, New York

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.830 align:middle line:90%
in central New York State.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:84%
And in the winter of 1848, they
told their shocked Methodist

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.310 align:middle line:84%
parents that the
bangs and raps that

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
were being heard in the
family cabin were spirit raps

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the girls had
devised a kind of language

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to communicate with
the spirit world,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.490 align:middle line:84%
not much different than
Kelley and John Dee.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, they were
consorting with spirits

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.339 align:middle line:84%
through sound and
noise that were heard

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:30.290 align:middle line:90%
throughout the family cabin.

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So different figures
descended upon the cabin

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the girls--
newspaper reporters, judges,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:90%
preachers.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.993 align:middle line:84%
And many of them
came away concluding

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that Kate and Margaret
were telling the truth,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and thus was born the
movement called spiritualism,

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:90%
or talking to the dead.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
The adjoining area
of the Hudson Valley

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
was also home to a
lot of people who

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.765 align:middle line:84%
were engaged in spiritualism,
channeling, mediumship, talking

00:17:57.765 --> 00:17:58.565 align:middle line:90%
to the dead.

00:17:58.565 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, people who were
interested in reaching larger

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
audiences migrated out of
the Burned Over District

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and might have traveled down the
Hudson Valley to New York City.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
influential group of seekers,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
a group that I'm personally
very attached to,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:90%
was called the Miracle Club.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.990 align:middle line:10%
This was a small circle
of spiritual seekers

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:10%
who assembled together
in New York City in 1875.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:10%
They were interested in
probing mediumship, Kabbalah,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.220 align:middle line:10%
reincarnation,
different Eastern and

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:10%
Western esoteric traditions.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.050 align:middle line:10%
And although they existed
for only a short time,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:10%
this became the nucleus
that shortly after went on

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.940 align:middle line:10%
to found the Theosophical
Society in the fall of 1875,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.940 align:middle line:10%
which is an organization
still existing today,

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.120 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to studying
world religion in all

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:10%
of its variants.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it really ignited
the revolution

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:84%
in alternative spirituality that
swept the globe and continues

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
to today.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Christianity has had a
powerful influence on humanity.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Through the tales and
messages woven through the New

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Testament, humans are taught
lessons of love and unity

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:90%
as well as loss and betrayal.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:10%
But the question
remains, how much

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.680 align:middle line:10%
did this religion influence
humanity's ability

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.515 align:middle line:10%
to channel at the quantum level?

00:19:26.515 --> 00:19:30.220 align:middle line:90%


00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Ages ago, humanity was
actually more open to receiving

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.820 align:middle line:90%
spiritual communication.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot more people
than today were

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.530 align:middle line:84%
really open to their
psychic abilities.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
They didn't just believe
that there were spirits out

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
in the wild in
the natural world,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that their ancestors
walked among them.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a part of
their daily life.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.160 align:middle line:84%
It was a part of
their existence,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.550 align:middle line:84%
that they knew that
the spirits were there.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> When you start
learning about channeling,

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you will come across this idea
that channeling experiences run

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
in families.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.710 align:middle line:10%
So we're really
curious about if we

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:10%
could see this in the DNA
and the actual genetics.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So we did a small
pilot study where

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.920 align:middle line:84%
we vetted various psychics who
were very high-functioning.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.200 align:middle line:84%
We had them go through
many different hoops

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
to test their actual
psychic ability.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:10%
And most of these had people
with psychic abilities

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.670 align:middle line:10%
in their families.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Then we got control people who
were matched for age, gender,

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and race who didn't have
any psychic abilities, who

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:84%
performed very poorly
on all the tests

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and also didn't have any family
members that they believed

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:90%
had these abilities as well.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.580 align:middle line:84%
We got saliva samples from
them and did a genetic analysis

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to look at the similarities
and differences between them.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.400 align:middle line:90%
We found something very unique.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There was a difference
between the two

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
in a part of the DNA
called the non-coding part.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
So this used to be
called the junk DNA,

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.380 align:middle line:84%
but now it's called
non-coding because they

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:84%
know that it plays a pivotal
role in DNA's function.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So the version of this
DNA that the psychics had

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
was the original, or
what's called the wild type

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:84%
version of these genes,
whereas the control group

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.580 align:middle line:90%
had a mutation.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
fascinating, when

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
you think about our premise
that all humans innately have

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:90%
this capacity.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.060 align:middle line:90%
It was this original version.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So we took that one
step further and looked

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
at large genetic
databases to see

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:51.460 align:middle line:84%
the expression of
this genetic code,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and we found that-- we
looked at two pieces.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.520 align:middle line:84%
One was the spread
of Christianity

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
because we know
that Christianity

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
obviously persecuted people
who expressed these traits.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And we did find an
association between the spread

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity
and the mutation,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning less psychic ability
or no psychic ability.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.300 align:middle line:84%
We also had this
hypothesis that perhaps it

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.770 align:middle line:84%
would be associated with
technology because as we become

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
more dependent on technology
for location and food sources,

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:31.540 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that we wouldn't
need to be able to tune in

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.710 align:middle line:84%
to know where the water is or
where the herd of buffalo is,

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and it would not select
for psychic ability.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And that also had
an association.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.230 align:middle line:84%
So the countries that
had increased technology

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
had more expression of
this mutation, so less

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:90%
psychic abilities, in essence.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Christian practice, it came
in that their Bible talked

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.930 align:middle line:84%
about how mediumship,
about how channeling,

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
about connecting with
spirits was an evil practice.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
People who were
absolutely in tune

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.620 align:middle line:84%
with things, people who
were natural healers who

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:84%
had this ability were brought
to a near non-existence.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And that would have
affected our genetic line,

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.660 align:middle line:84%
that the people who had
a natural proclivity

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.940 align:middle line:84%
for psychic ability,
for channeling,

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.340 align:middle line:90%
were no longer in the gene pool.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Now that those bonds of
Orthodox Christianity

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
are not as tight
as they once were,

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.280 align:middle line:84%
people are starting to
open their abilities.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.822 align:middle line:84%
They're starting to
come around more.

00:23:36.822 --> 00:23:38.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll bet you
we're going to start

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.480 align:middle line:84%
seeing more and
more of those genes

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in the whole genetic structure
of the world starting

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to increase and grow even
more because more people

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:90%
are becoming psychic today.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:52.410 align:middle line:84%
More people are getting in tune,
and they're becoming aware.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> We're moving from the time
where people are being attacked

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
for being an oracle into a time
where they are being consulted.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> As more and more discover
and tune their extra senses,

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:14.730 align:middle line:84%
what messages will be delivered
to inspire and remind us about

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.655 align:middle line:90%
the power of unconditional love?

00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:24.440 align:middle line:10%
>> If all beings loved
themselves unconditionally,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.790 align:middle line:10%
they would have the
capability of loving others.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
resistance or judgment.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Judgment is just a projection
from the individual judging.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We often say to judge another's
path is inappropriate,

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:51.050 align:middle line:84%
for you know not what the
soul's choice and expansion is

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to be by the learnings
they're having,

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:84%
from whatever they're choosing
or deciding for on their path.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Just because you
would not choose

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
it does not mean it's
not right for their path.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You are doing everything you
can do by sharing information

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
you believe to be
helpful with others.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
What they do with
that information,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:84%
whether they use it
or not, is absolutely

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.580 align:middle line:84%
none of your business because
you don't know their path.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
You have to let go of
any need that someone

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
has to understand
or listen or believe

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:90%
what it is you're sharing.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Then it comes from the
unconditional love,

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and then you actually
make it more likely

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.920 align:middle line:84%
that they will probably
choose it at some point.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But even if it's 10 or 100
years from now or in other lives

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.130 align:middle line:84%
or other dimensions,
eventually they'll

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.950 align:middle line:84%
remember what you
taught, what you shared,

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
and it may be useful to them
somewhere down the road.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
know it in this life.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So we would always suggest that
everyone let go of the idea

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that anyone needs to learn these
things because again, remember,

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:84%
you don't change the
planet you're on,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.010 align:middle line:90%
you're shifting to other worlds.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
If you share information and
give them the opportunity

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.375 align:middle line:84%
to choose something
more positive,

00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
something that will
allow them to shift

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.650 align:middle line:84%
to more positive
versions of Earth,

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:12.960 align:middle line:84%
you have done everything
that you can, and that's it.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You cannot in any way, shape
or form insist that they must

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.010 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:90%
That's not your business.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:26.000 align:middle line:90%
