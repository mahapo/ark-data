00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Several channeled messages
speak of a veil around

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.510 align:middle line:90%
the third dimension.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.009 align:middle line:84%
Some have referred to it as a
planetary net for protection

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
from any outside influence in
the early stages of evolution.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
This veil appears to
be a grand design that

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.860 align:middle line:84%
allows us to feel separation
and individuality.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.950 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
when we get a glimpse

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:90%
of what lies beyond the veil?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.110 align:middle line:10%
>> We say veil because
that gives you a picture

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.240 align:middle line:10%
in your mind of something that's
relative to your knowledge

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.815 align:middle line:10%
at the time, yes?

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
grasp a concept.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.050 align:middle line:84%
If we just said
multidimensionality,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
you can take in the word, but
there's no picture to that,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
is there?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
So we brought the word "veil"
because you've seen veils.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:90%
You see through them, yes?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
A bride wears a veil, you
can still see her face, yes?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's a separation
between her

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
and the outside
world for a moment.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The veil has
different levels.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:10%
So there is a spiritual veil.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:10%
There's an evolutionary veil.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
There is a planetary
veil, which means

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
what we're able to see in spirit
but because the veil is there

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
holding a barrier until we
show that we are able to lift

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.100 align:middle line:84%
those frequencies to a point
where the veil no longer has

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times people
think there's just one veil.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.440 align:middle line:90%
There is many veils.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we progress
as human beings

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
on planet Earth in
the way we interact

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:84%
with each other in our cells
and then as a collective,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
each veil then begins to shift
as according to our evolution.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
>> This goes along with a
forgetfulness, if you will,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
about the true
nature of who we are.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:10%
And some of the content talks
about that actually being

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:10%
orchestrated in some way that
there's this protective field

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:10%
or bubble around the
Earth that blocks humans

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.330 align:middle line:10%
from really experiencing their
full expression on purpose

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.390 align:middle line:10%
for the learning
opportunity and that

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.430 align:middle line:10%
today, in this age, that that
protective bubble is thinning

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:10%
as humanity is embarking on
this awakening phenomenon.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And these channeled
content coming

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
from all around
the world, how are

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.060 align:middle line:84%
these similar messages coming
in from different places?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, some devil's
advocate might say

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.290 align:middle line:84%
once there's this strong idea
that humanity is awakening

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
in this way, then all the other
channelers around the world

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.770 align:middle line:84%
are telepathically
tuning into that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
and bringing forth
that information.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.290 align:middle line:84%
My argument is,
well, if that's true,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
it's incredible because
that's telepathy,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and there we go, showing
the example of that.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:10%
>> The veil is just a metaphor.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:10%
Your consciousness
is like a radio.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.350 align:middle line:84%
You could tune in, you could
tune out anytime, anywhere,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:90%
whatever reason you want to.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when we go
into seance, we'll

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.890 align:middle line:90%
use the veil as a metaphor.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.080 align:middle line:84%
We're raising the veil,
we're opening the veil,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.640 align:middle line:84%
the veil is thinning,
however we want to say it.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And that is really
just a means of helping

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
you tune in to the
paranormal to be aware of it.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
They teach people how to coexist
peacefully and cooperatively

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.900 align:middle line:84%
with the paranormal so
that you can understand

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that the paranormal is a
normal part of our world

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and that the supernatural
is completely natural.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
It's just we were taught
to be distant from it.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.830 align:middle line:84%
We were taught to
be afraid of it,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's unusual and
strange and bizarre.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I help people to realize
it is a perfectly normal part

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.300 align:middle line:84%
of who we are as human beings
and a completely natural part

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:90%
of everything around us.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Several tools have been used
by mediums throughout history

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to pierce the veil
to other dimensions.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:84%
The pendulum, planchette,
tarot cards, and crystal balls

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
are common tools in
the paranormal arts.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
But one mystical tool became
a supernatural phenomenon.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was a kid, I was
fascinated with Ouija boards,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:10%
and I always had the question
of how something that came

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:10%
in a gift-wrapped box with a
barcode on it could have any

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.470 align:middle line:10%
occult properties
to it whatsoever.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And yet everyone seems to
have a scary Ouija board

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
story from some point in
their life or another.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:10%
Now, the earliest records that
we have of the Ouija board

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.930 align:middle line:10%
is of it being used in
northern Ohio in 1886.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:10%
This is according to a
newspaper article where

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:10%
it was called the alphabet
board or the witching board,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:10%
and it was a craze among
Ohio spiritualists.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.040 align:middle line:10%
About five years later, it was
patented as the Ouija board

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.390 align:middle line:10%
by a group of Baltimore
novelty and toy manufacturers.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:10%
And it caught fire and spread
across the whole country.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.780 align:middle line:10%
In the late 1960s, there
was a period of time

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:10%
where Ouija outsold Monopoly
as the most popular game board

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.980 align:middle line:10%
in the country.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:10%
It probably could
be called a form

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.730 align:middle line:10%
of at-home or
do-it-yourself channeling.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.730 align:middle line:10%
That's always been the
appeal of the Ouija board

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.860 align:middle line:10%
because it felt to
people like a device

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.522 align:middle line:10%
that they can use to pierce
a veil to the other side.

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Like any device,
like any object,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.610 align:middle line:10%
like any technique or tool
or ritual in your physical

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.240 align:middle line:10%
reality, it is like
anything a permission slip.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Some people simply gravitate
toward certain symbols,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
certain representations
of certain frequencies.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:90%
They have an attraction to it.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And, therefore, by using that
particular tool or device,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.580 align:middle line:84%
it works to allow them
to give themselves

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
permission to put themselves
in the proper state

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to access the
information they seek,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.320 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes thinking that it's
the device that's doing it,

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:90%
but they're doing it.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.490 align:middle line:84%
They're just using the
device as an excuse

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.295 align:middle line:84%
to make it seem easier
to access the information

00:07:03.295 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
necessarily at first think

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:90%
they have the ability to do so.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, you realize that
all these things are just

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
permission slips, just triggers
for you to access things

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.320 align:middle line:90%
that you're accessing anyway.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, you become
your own permission slip

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and don't need any other
rituals, techniques, or tools.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to the
tools of physical mediumship,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.760 align:middle line:84%
you have to remember that you
are the critical component

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.660 align:middle line:84%
to the entire thing, that a
spirit cannot use a pendulum

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
or Ouija board or dowsing rods
or table tipping without you

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.940 align:middle line:90%
sharing your energy.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:90%
You are an important part of it.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you get
something that goes wonky

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
in physical mediumship,
pendulum, Ouija, anything,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:90%
challenge that spirit.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:90%
Are you really this?

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.050 align:middle line:90%
Are you a trickster?

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Am I really picking up
this information correctly?

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And that will help to
calibrate and reset that

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:84%
to a more positive, conducive
information experience.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There are generations and
generations of stories that

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.970 align:middle line:84%
come out of the Ouija board,
many of which are unsettling

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:90%
or frightening.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.120 align:middle line:84%
And Ouija was re-popularized
in the novel and movie

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.470 align:middle line:84%
"The Exorcist" as being
a portal to the sinister.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the Ouija
board has always

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.040 align:middle line:84%
had an alluring and sometimes
sinister reputation.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:84%
But it's at the heart of a
lot of unusual and interesting

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.060 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
The third most popular religion
in the nation of Vietnam

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:90%
today is called Caodaism.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
It ranks third after
Catholicism and Buddhism.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.909 align:middle line:84%
And it's a mystical faith that
was channeled through a Ouija

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:39.640 align:middle line:90%
board in the early 1920s.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
So Ouija lies at the
heart of a lot of things

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.500 align:middle line:84%
that people wouldn't expect
in contemporary culture.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Growing up, I was always
told never to play with a Ouija

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:84%
board or to dabble in a fun,
jokey way because that could

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
just attract lower beings
is what they called them.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's true in
many other traditions as well.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:10%
And I think it leads to
this concept of treating it

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:10%
as a joke or not taking
it seriously or having

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.550 align:middle line:10%
these experiences be
a game if you will.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:10%
There's a lack of
sacredness and honoring

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:29.890 align:middle line:10%
that perhaps invites
not-well-intended experiences

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:10%
to come to fruition.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We have seen so
many movies out there.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.410 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the TV shows
that are out there.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
We have eyewitness accounts.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:10%
And in today's world, we've
got all of the social media

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.300 align:middle line:10%
videos of people
using Ouija boards

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:10%
or going into haunted
locations reinforcing

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:10%
this fear-based perceptions
of the paranormal,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.185 align:middle line:10%
which, yeah, if you believe
the paranormal is scary

00:09:52.185 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:10%
and you really
believe that there

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.540 align:middle line:10%
are awful, terrible
things in the paranormal,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:10%
then every one of your
paranormal experiences

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.590 align:middle line:10%
is going to be awful.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.780 align:middle line:84%
But when you open
yourselves up to what's

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:84%
going on, what the
world is out there,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
you realize the paranormal
is not as scary as it is.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
One of my big rules of
paranormal engagement

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
is the more you interact
with the paranormal,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the safer it gets because the
more you interact with it,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
you realize, oh, this isn't
that scary at all, that rewrites

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:90%
that belief that it's scary.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
You interact with it
more, and you go, wow,

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:23.490 align:middle line:90%
that was beautiful.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:90%
That was wonderful.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Maybe these people were wrong.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.808 align:middle line:90%
That belief gets rewritten.

00:10:27.808 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So the more you're experiencing
the paranormal for what

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.250 align:middle line:84%
it really is, the less
negative, bad things

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.440 align:middle line:84%
are going to happen to
you because you're really

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.560 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the reality of
it instead of the reality

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're generating
and creating.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Graveyards and battlefields
are full of tales of paranormal

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Several people claim to
feel the strong presence

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
of spirits around these sites.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Once the body dies in
the third dimension,

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:01.190 align:middle line:90%
can souls get lost in the veil?

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:10%
>> I know the human mind is
really curious and excited

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.430 align:middle line:10%
about the different
personalities that are coming

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.560 align:middle line:10%
through supposedly.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet I like to focus
right now on the content

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that's coming through and
how useful that can be to us.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I channel or
someone else is channeling

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and let's say a deceased
human is coming in

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and they're giving information
about how they passed,

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:84%
where they are now,
what they're up to,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.830 align:middle line:84%
is that the higher
self of the channeler,

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:84%
or is that really the distinct
and separate personality

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:90%
of the deceased person?

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, we can't
know that for sure.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And yet the information
that's coming through

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
is often verifiable.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.650 align:middle line:84%
We can get verifiable
information

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
about these deceased Uncle Joes
that perhaps no one else knew

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:90%
through these experiences.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:10%
>> The appearance of being lost,
the appearance of being trapped

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.250 align:middle line:10%
can simply be the result of
someone who carries certain

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:10%
very strong perspectives or
belief systems into the spirit

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:10%
world with them and remains
in a vibrational state usually

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:10%
referred to as the lower astral
realm where they are very close

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:10%
to the Earth vibration
and, therefore,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:10%
can sometimes be perceived by
physical people in the form you

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:10%
call ghosts.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And these people may
have unfinished business.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
They may not even know
that they're dead.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.103 align:middle line:84%
They may be holding on to
certain emotional ideas.

00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
They may not want to let
go of certain things.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.850 align:middle line:84%
They may be very
scared to move on,

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:90%
not knowing what there may be.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:10%
>> And there's a rule of energy
matter that it can't be created

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.850 align:middle line:10%
or destroyed.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:90%
It is conserved and changed.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.880 align:middle line:84%
So when there is an
informational imprint that

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes called
a ghost, that

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:90%
remains unless it's released.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Equally, there are situations
where our consciousness

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.490 align:middle line:84%
doesn't end when our body dies,
when the demise of our body--

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.060 align:middle line:90%
it goes on.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But if it transitions sometimes
in traumatic circumstances,

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
its perception can trap
it in levels of vibration

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
often called the astral level
where it can often be described

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.380 align:middle line:84%
as a lost soul
because essentially,

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
their consciousness,
their perception

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:90%
is trapped at that level.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it remains because
of the trauma of their passing.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it remains because
of the love that they have

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.820 align:middle line:90%
for those they leave behind.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I think sometimes
we call lost souls,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.060 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
necessarily lost.

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They can be trapped.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
They can remain for
a period of time

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.360 align:middle line:84%
ostensibly to take care
of the ones left behind.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
But all of this is meaningful
informational consciousness

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
at play.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is that spirit
guides will always attempt

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
to help them understand
that they have crossed back

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:84%
into, have awoken back
into their natural selves.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, they may
simply raise their vibration

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and go further into
spirit and away

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from the vibration of Earth
and the lower astral realm.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.160 align:middle line:10%
>> There are many different
beings we can contact

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:10%
in channeling.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.030 align:middle line:10%
One of the most popular
are spirit guides

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:10%
people connect with.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And these are
essentially souls we've

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.240 align:middle line:84%
had shared past
lifetimes with perhaps,

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
souls that are a part
of our memory complex.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.680 align:middle line:90%
They could be ancestors.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
So usually, the first
entities that one

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
will contact in channeling when
one is learning and cultivating

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
the art of channeling
is a spirit guide

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.740 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
beings who are watching over

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:84%
you and trying to make
sure you stay on track

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:90%
as much as possible.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody has at least one
spirit guide that stays with

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
you for life.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.820 align:middle line:90%
We usually have many.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:10%
I have one that helps me
with bringing in the spirits,

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.530 align:middle line:10%
not talking to them for me.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
They used to just
come and rush me.

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And like 20 people would start
talking, and I'd be like,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.967 align:middle line:84%
oh my God, it's so overwhelming
and bits and pieces here

00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:90%
and choppy, and I hate it.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, line up
and be in order.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> So do I have guides?

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:10%
Of course, I do.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.680 align:middle line:10%
I have a wonderful posse.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.350 align:middle line:10%
And I love them so
much, and they love me.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the greatest thing ever to
feel that warmth and connection

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.520 align:middle line:84%
with those who protect you and
guide you in this human life,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing like it.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I try not to forget
about them too much,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.720 align:middle line:90%
and I call on them.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They will knock on the wall if
they want to get my attention,

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:90%
and I hear that frequently.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.140 align:middle line:90%
And I know other people do.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll hear my
name being called,

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.510 align:middle line:90%
and I pay attention to that.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Countless practices and
tools have been devoted

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to voluntarily connecting
with the spirit world.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
But what happens when
we are forced to meet

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:90%
these spirits beyond the veil?

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Several people who have
had a near-death experience

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.320 align:middle line:84%
awaken with the channeling
and healing gifts ignited.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a wonderful book by
David Fontana that talks about

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:10%
the various messages that
mediums have given about what

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.410 align:middle line:10%
actually happens after we die.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's often talk
about different levels.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And we see this in multiple
different religions

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.970 align:middle line:84%
as well that perhaps
when we first pass,

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
there is this transitional zone
where there is a life review,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.520 align:middle line:84%
there is some sort
of integration

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that happens
incorporating learnings

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:90%
from our earthly existence.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when that
stage is complete,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:84%
there is a shift to a
different dimension or level

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want to
call it that is less dense,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that is not as connected
to the earthly world.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
And we see this message over
and over again from mediums,

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
from multiple different
religious and spiritual

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.390 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I guess we just
need to wait and see

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
when it happens to
us the reality of it.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a near-death
experience in March of 1969.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.470 align:middle line:90%
I had pulmonary embolus.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Both my lungs were full of
fluid, and I could not breathe.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:10%
It felt as if I had an
elephant sitting on my chest.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was in intensive care.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And my family was being
prepared that I probably

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.020 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't live through the day.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> At 26, while I was
in architecture school,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.000 align:middle line:90%
I got sick on Super Bowl Sunday.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:90%
I went blind first.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And within 11 days, I was dead.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> In my late 20s, I was
in the jungle in Belize.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And the shaman there was doing
this ritual with these herbs

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and having me look into
the smoke and said to me,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.500 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die soon.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when I came
back from Belize,

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.960 align:middle line:90%
I was laying in my room.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was a spirit
standing in front of me.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, are you ready?

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yes.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And it reached into my body,
and I felt excruciating pain.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.880 align:middle line:10%
I could feel all of my organs
shutting down one by one.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.290 align:middle line:10%
It was almost like my body
was this organic spirit

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and the spirits were
flying out of my body.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I could feel things
just turning off.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And the pain of it
was so excruciating.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.040 align:middle line:10%
And I remember my
human side came in.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And my human side
was, I don't want

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
to die, I don't want to
die, I don't want to die.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear me
screaming in my head.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I watched
spirits come in.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:84%
There was my father's
secretary, Kate, who had passed.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:84%
There was my Uncle
Wally and Darrell.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And there were
angels in the room.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And I've always been
connected with angels.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is like, hi,
everybody, how are you doing?

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And I felt such peace.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:90%
It was amazing.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.180 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't afraid.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew I was going to
die, and that was fine.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I was totally aware
of what was happening.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.080 align:middle line:90%
And I had just had a new baby.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
stay on the planet.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:90%
I had two little kids at home.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And I kept saying, hey,
God, give me a job.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.650 align:middle line:90%
I'll do anything.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:90%
I want to stay here.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:90%
And that became a mantra.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I just kept repeating
that in my mind.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember going up
into a beautiful tunnel,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.250 align:middle line:84%
and there were other
beings of light.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
That's the only way
you can describe them.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
They were in humanoid
form, but they

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
were made of light and
electricity and particle

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
colors.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.610 align:middle line:90%
And it was stunningly beautiful.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in the cubicle
of an intensive care.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And it became extremely
bright as if the sun

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.860 align:middle line:90%
had risen in the room itself.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The room just kind of all
went very bright and liquidy.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.520 align:middle line:90%
And my ancestors were there.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And they said to me,
you're about to transition

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:40.670 align:middle line:84%
from this dimension
to another dimension.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.460 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be very
painful in your body

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.910 align:middle line:84%
if you keep trying
to fight to hold on.

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Let go when it happens.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And in my inner mind hearing
like we hear our own thoughts,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I heard a distinct male voice
say, remember, my child,

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:90%
you are loved.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I fell into
the most beautiful,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:90%
glorious white light.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And the song "Blinded by
the Light," that is true.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
I was absolutely
blinded by the light.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I felt the presence
of others around me

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:84%
like I was in the
center of a huddle.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I just--

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:90%
I gave up.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I just surrendered.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:90%
And it was this liquid.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It was this luminescent
ocean water.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.440 align:middle line:90%
It was watery.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Came in and just pulled
me out of my body.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:90%
And I was floating.

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And I could see my body.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:10%
And I could hear the sound
of "eee" on their monitor.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And I could hear the
voices of everyone talking.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And I could see in every
angle that I wanted to see in.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And then I felt as if my
crown had opened up and that

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:84%
warm honey had been poured
in because I just felt this

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:84%
seeping warmth inside just
moving down through my body.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And as it went through
the trunk of my body,

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt as if I could
take a deep breath.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And then it was
just this immense love.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And it was this other
energy that was there.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:84%
It was like love was
there, and then there

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
was this other energy
of all the things

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I experience in humanity.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just gravitated
towards the love.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And I felt so welcomed
and so loved and protected.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't see yet
with my spiritual eyes.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.510 align:middle line:90%
But slowly, I woke up.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that there
were these incredible beings

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.070 align:middle line:90%
around me.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:90%
They were angels without wings.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.180 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
wings or anything

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:52.400 align:middle line:84%
like Michelangelo or Ruben
paint, but I knew they were.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.410 align:middle line:90%
And I felt like I was home.

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> These beings came into the
room, and they spoke to me.

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.957 align:middle line:10%
And they said, oh, I'm
getting chills to my body.

00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like I'm there again.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.920 align:middle line:90%


00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:12.850 align:middle line:84%
They said, we're going to show
you how to heal your lungs

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.200 align:middle line:90%
and breathe.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.810 align:middle line:84%
So in the morning,
you will be breathing.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But you have to follow
everything we say.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything they told
me to do with my thoughts.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, in the
morning, I was breathing.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's as clear to me
today as it was 53 years ago.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And it was, I
believe, a miraculous

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.050 align:middle line:90%
healing at that moment.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%
I started getting better.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.210 align:middle line:84%
The doctors were amazed
because they, of course,

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:49.420 align:middle line:84%
didn't think I was going
to make it through the day.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I really felt the power
of interconnectedness then

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and what I had done and
how we were all connected.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And then about six
months after I was out

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital, I started
having all kinds of psychic

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.940 align:middle line:84%
phenomena happening to me
externally, internally.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:90%
I could hear the messages.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.825 align:middle line:84%
There were physical
sensations when

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:90%
a spirit wanted to speak to me.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The chair where I was sitting
would physically move.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:84%
So there was a lot of stuff
that was kind of unusual.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, I open up to the
unseen world because that's how

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I played with it as I put my
mind through my own blindness

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.580 align:middle line:84%
and put my mind through
that space of emptiness.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered that,
again, it's not invisible.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It just has a
different structure.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It has a different resonance,
different vibration,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:90%
different levels of density.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And so I observe very keenly
all of these different things

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.060 align:middle line:90%
that I've been seeing.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And my work came along
very haphazardly.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Somebody raised their hand, does
anybody a medical intuitive?

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And some force just raised
my hand, and it's like--

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and that was my first
client back in the '80s.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.100 align:middle line:10%
Once I died and had
that experience,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.580 align:middle line:10%
I now see the spirit world
so much more clearer now.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me
an ability to know

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:84%
how to facilitate the
most needed information

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that is necessary for
people at the time

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
that they need it versus just
giving them every single thing

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:90%
that I know.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And that really helped me
to be able to serve people

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:90%
in such a greater way.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Miracles happen.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:90%
And they're rare.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is going
to get what I got.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:90%
I was extremely fortunate.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But miracles do happen, and they
happen in large and small ways.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.900 align:middle line:90%
And we must never forget that.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> As more and more channels
open and this veil around

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:84%
our reality is pierced,
what other messages will be

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:05.860 align:middle line:84%
delivered to inspire and remind
us about the amazing power

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
within humanity?

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The phenomenon of who
you are here on this planet,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:84%
really what you are as a soul,
and who you're here to be will

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.990 align:middle line:84%
come more and more
into fruition.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And you'll be more and
more comfortable with it.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's when words like
channeling or spirit or spirit

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
guides will start to fade
into a common language

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that we all
understand and accept.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is the next level?

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:90%
Is it an actual spatial place?

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:48.400 align:middle line:84%
My intuitive sense is that
it's a layered reality somehow

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and that with my
physical eyes, I can only

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.250 align:middle line:90%
see certain aspects of that.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But just like we put on
3D glasses in the theater,

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.320 align:middle line:84%
if I had a different
filter, I might

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
be able to see
things that I can't

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.320 align:middle line:90%
see with my physical eyes.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Channeled content is full of
the term "dimensions," is full

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.220 align:middle line:90%
of the term "frequency."

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very much
looking forward

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:21.070 align:middle line:84%
to developing the tools
to actually measure

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.930 align:middle line:90%
these frequencies.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The energy is
refined so much more,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and the veils between the
dimensions are thinner than

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.250 align:middle line:90%
they've ever been.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So the recognition
of all that you are

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.335 align:middle line:84%
is possible, all that you've
been, and all that you will be.

00:27:38.335 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the aperture expansion
we're speaking about, taking

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:90%
in the bigger picture.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:90%
